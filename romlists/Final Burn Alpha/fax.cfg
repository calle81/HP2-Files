overview 500 over the average arcade game price at the time.This game used an advanced (proprietary), compression algorithm to hold nearly 3700 questions in a tiny amount of EPROM space (roughly 128K, which was still a huge amount of storage in 1983, which was why this game was so expensive). Exidy also sold several EPROM replacement kits that provided new questions, but they sold very poorly, and are nearly impossible to find today.
