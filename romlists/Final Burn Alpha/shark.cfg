overview Terror reigns under the ocean surface. It's a heavy traffic of sharks, nasty fish, seahorses, crabs, lobsters and jellyfish. They swim fast, jerk up and down, lurk behind plants, or slide under coral reefs. They have weird shapes, striking colors, tiny or big sizes, and very mean intentions. They eat or kill each other at first sight!Under your control, a small fish will begin scoring points by quickly GULPING SMALLER FISH and NIBBLING AT A BLACK SHARK'S TAIL. Watch for that shark turning around on you a bit too fast... or you're dead! Never touch his head or fins! For every 1000 points  earned, you'll GROW ONE SIZE BIGGER. For every shark, crab, or lobster killed, you'll get one bonus small fish. You start with 5 small fish, one at a time, each a size 1, capable of growing up to size 5. After you've reached size 5, for every 1000 points earned you'll get a BONUS FISH instead. At certain sizes you're capable of eating up seahorses or killing falling crabs and lobsters. But when the size-6 jellyfish begins to cruise around, you'd better avoid him... as you would any fish or thing bigger than you... or you're finished. Get eaten up once, another small fish will take your place. But how many fish in your team have you left? Soon you'll have only one. WIN BY SCORING HIGH AND STAYING ALIVE!
