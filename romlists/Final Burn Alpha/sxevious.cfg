overview Super Xevious Gump no Nazo is a vertical shooter by Namco. Interestingly, this is a Famicom exclusive sequel to Xevious and not a port of the arcade game of the same name released in 1984. GAMP no Nazo translates as GAMP's mystery and this is where the game greatly differs from other Xevious games. The essential task of each stage is for the player to fulfill a certain condition. Each one of the sixteen levels just loops until the condition is fully satisfied and each area features a different puzzle to solve. The objectives vary from finding the stage's hidden exist to destroying all the objects of a particular kind. The player takes control of the Solvalou and can shoot ahead and drop bombs in the classic Xevious tradition. However, Super Xevious now features power-ups. A small spaceship appears in almost every stage and drops colored power-capsules - the black ones activate a rotating shield, the yellow ones equip a large bomb-target and then the blue ones allows the ship to also fire backward.
