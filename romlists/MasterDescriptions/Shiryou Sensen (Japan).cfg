overview The game is kind of a cross between the random encounters in open environments of Dragon Quest and real-time side-view battles of Zelda II. The survival component of this horror games comes from the limited ammunition for each firearm. Players must choose when to fight and when to conserve ammo, and finding bullets is always a top priority. The game also features a limited inventory and crates to store items. War of the Dead uses a day-night cycle in which the player fights during the day and can sleep at night to recover health. A record is kept of how many days the player has survived.
