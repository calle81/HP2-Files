***Zombi*** is an icon-driven arcade adventure video game. It was  
Ubisoft's first publication, released when the company was established  
in 1986. 
 
 
 
 
A first-person arcade adventure, it draws inspiration from the  
George A. Romero film Dawn of the Dead; the player controlling four  
protagonists exploring a zombie-filled shopping mall. It draws from  
many parts of the film, including the gun shops, the escalators, and  
the articulated trucks used to block the entrances. If a character's  
health is depleted, he turns into a zombie, which then roams the room  
they died in. Zombies can be killed either by numerous body shots,  
or a single shot to the head. Characters were named after the creators  
of the game. 
 
 
 
 
The original Amstrad CPC version was programmed by Yannick Cadin and  
S.L. Coemelck, with graphics by Patrick Daher and music by Philippe  
Marchiset. 
 
 
 
 
It was re-released in 1990, with ports developed for the ZX Spectrum  
(by Geoff Phillips, Colin Jones and Steve Chance), Commodore 64  
(Jean Noel Moyne, Laurent Poujoulat, Jean Francois Auroux), Amiga  
(Alexander Yarmitsky), Atari ST and DOS. 
 
 
 
 
The ZX Spectrum version was awarded 87% by Sinclair User magazine and  
77% byYour Sinclair, both reviewers were impressed with the  
immersive atmosphere. 
 
 
 
 
CU Amiga awarded the Amiga version of the game 85%, whilst German  
magazine Amiga Joker scored it at 69%. 
 
 
 
 
Zzap!64 awarded the Commodore 64 version of the game 72%. The  
reviewer said that the gameplay is outdated and is very similar to  
Catch 23, a 1987 ZX Spectrum game.
