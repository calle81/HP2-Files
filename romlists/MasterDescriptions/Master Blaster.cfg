overview 1996 saw the release of Master Blaster on the Amiga systems, a Bomberman clone, created by Alpha Brothers and distributed by Nexus as a Shareware. Master Blaster v2.21 was later made freeware and is available for download on Aminet. 
 
This game is based on the idea of Bomberman. You can play with up to 5 enemies at the same time. The main goal is to survive and kill all the other enemies. You can do this by placing bombs on the ground. They will destroy the brick walls around you and may even release some extras to collect. 
 
Very good Bomberman/DynaBlaster clone that only focus is on the VS Battle aspect of the game. It remains one of the best multiplayer PD games ever!
