overview Sindibad: Chitei No Daimakyuu ("Sinbad and the Great Underground Temple") is an RPG published by IGS, but its developer is presently unknown. The title screen credits an unknown company named "Game Princess". It features the mythical hero Sinbad and the setting has an Arabian/North African theme. 
 
It plays similarly to Dragon Quest and numerous other early console JRPGs, in which the player manages a party of adventurers and fights enemies via menu-driven turn-based combat.
