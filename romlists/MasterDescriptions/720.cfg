overview Text from the USA Manual:As the jammin' skateboarder you know you are, you've got to test your skills in the toughest course any skateboarder has ever seen. You start off with a hundred bucks in your pocket, your trusty skateboard, and the awesome moves you've learned along the way. Find your way around the park while dodging kamikaze cars, looney thugs and killer bees. You've only got a short amount of time to work your way through each one of the four levels, or classes, of difficulty. Show off your hot moves, and rack up points to earn tickets to the parks. If you’re lucky, you might find some loose bills lying around. Scoop ‘em up. You know you'd like to get the dough to buy those cool duds and some of that hot equipment.
