***Turbo Out Run*** is a 1989 arcade racing game released by Sega. A  
follow-up to 1986's Out Run, it was released as a dedicated game, as  
well as an upgrade kit for the original Out Run board. 
 
 
 
 
Like it predecessor, Turbo OutRun has players driving a Ferrari, this  
time a Ferrari F40. Players now traverse a set route across the entire  
continental United States from New York City to Los Angeles instead of  
the branching paths of the first game. In addition to a time limit,  
Turbo OutRun also adds a computer-controlled opponent driving a  
Porsche 959. The "Turbo" in the title also plays a factor as players  
can now press a button to receive a brief turbo boost of speed.  
Various power-ups which increase the vehicle's attributes can now be  
chosen at various stages of the game. 
 
 
 
 
Ports of Turbo OutRun were released for personal computers, as well  
as Sega's own Master System and Mega Drive.
