overview The time is yesteryear, when knights scoured the countryside in search of the Holy Grail, defended the honor of fair maidens and fought a never-ending battle against rampant evil forces. Thrown into this mayhem, is the courageous Sir Arthur. A victorious knight with the awesome task of penetrating the Demon's Castle to pulverize the Prince of Darkness. Can he do it? It's up to you. You'll dangerously travel through the Place of Execution, the Village of Decay, the Town of Fire, and the Crystal Forest with an arsenal of weapons at your side. And when you're really down on your luck, magic fights might with powerful results. The only problem? You'll have to learn how to use it. And avoid it. Because their magic has the power to change you into a helpless duck among other things. But there's not much time. Lives depend on you. So brandish your sword and make mincemeat of your foes.
