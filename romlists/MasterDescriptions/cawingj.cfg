overview A solid and hugely playable sequel to 1989's superb sideways scrolling shoot-em-up, Area 88. As with the original, players chose any one of three different jet fighters and battle their way through ten enemy-packed stages. Another idea carried over from Area 88 is the end-of-level shop, which allows players to buy weapon and shield upgrades for their jet fighter.
