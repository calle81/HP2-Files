overview 600 is your standard maze game (one of dozens released in the wake of Pac-Man, with a few twists. The game begins by showing your turtle entering a building (a very early 'cut scene'), you are then presented with the first maze. Each maze has several boxes (with question marks on them), scattered around. You must open these boxes one at a time by walking on to them. Each box contains either an enemy race car (who will pursue you), or a 'KidTurtle'. The 'KidTurtles' are what you are looking for here. When you find one it will climb onto your back, and you have to take it back to the turtle house which will be located in one of the corners. After you rescue a few turtles the game becomes more difficult because of the amount of baddies that you will have released. However, you have some energy you can use to lay land mines. You can drop these in the path of a baddie, and cause him to freeze temporarily (you can safely walk over frozen baddies). A new game screen starts after you rescue all the 'KidTurtles'. After 8 levels you get to watch a small ending sequence, and then the game starts over with increased difficulty.
