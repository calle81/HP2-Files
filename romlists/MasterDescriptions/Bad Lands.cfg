***Badlands*** is a 1989 arcade game published by Atari Games. It was  
later ported by Domark under the Tengen label to a number of home  
computers. It is set in the aftermath of a nuclear war and races around  
abandoned wastelands with many hazards. Three gun-armed cars race around  
to win prizes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
***Gameplay*** 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Badlands is effectively the spiritual successor to Atari's previous  
racing games Super Sprint and Championship Sprint. Similarly to the  
Sprint titles, Badlands pits three cars against each other in a three  
lap race around a small, single-screen circuit. Bonuses are present in  
the form of wrenches which can be traded for goods such as extra speed, 
 extra acceleration or better tires 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unlike the Sprint games, Badlands expands upon the formula, taking place  
in a post-apocalyptic environment and equipping each of the players with  
cannons. In reality, the cannons do little except to slow cars down by  
repeatedly shooting at them, but the shop between levels offers the  
possibility of arming the car with missiles which will destroy the  
target car, placing it at a severe disadvantage as a replacement is  
brought onto the track, taking a few seconds. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The tracks also featured a number of new obstacles, including mines  
and retractable barricades. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
**Home Versions*** 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The home computer versions of the game were released by Domark under  
the Tengen label. Development was carried out by Teque under the  
leadership of Matt Furniss. All of the versions were accurate in  
gameplay terms, with graphical compromises being necessary depending  
on the system. The Amiga and Atari ST versions of the game were the  
most faithful to the original, although the C64 version was graphically 
 very similar, in spite of more blocky graphics. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions were virtually identical to each  
other. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Response to the Spectrum version was mixed. Your Sinclair and CRASH  
awarded average marks, both claiming in reviews of the original and  
re-release that the title's contemporary Super Off-Road was superior.  
Sinclair User expressed more enthusiasm for the game, but made the  
same comparison to Super Off-Road.
