overview Alter Ego is a "life simulator" that presents you with a series of life experiences that take you from infancy through old age.  You can live out your own life, or the life of someone else, possibly someone you wish you could be.  You can live out fantasies without risk, relive your childhood, or maybe see the world from your kids'/parents'/spouse's eyes. 
 
The life situations you encounter have the ability to change or become eliminated based on previous decisions you make. While the life you live is a fantasy, the actions you take have very real and thought-provoking responses.
