overview Play alone or challenge up to 3 of your friends in this Rock Trivia game. The game screen is laid out much like a Jeopardy board and players take turns at clicking on a square to reveal a multiple choice question. Get it right and you gain points, get it wrong and it's the next players turn. The game ends when at least 3 of the 4 questions in each category have been answered correctly. The questions revolve around Rock music and cover the 1950's-1980's. He who finishes with the most points wins.
