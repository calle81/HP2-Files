overview Gradius III is a side-scrolling shooter by Konami and based on the hit arcade game originally released in 1989. The monstrous Bacterion Empire is back in its pursuit of transforming whole planets into hideous and frightful alien worlds. The Vic Viper star fighter returns once again to save planet Gradius and the universe. Gradius III follows the formula set by its predecessors, requiring the player to collect and accumulate pulsating power pods (dropped by orange enemy ships), and to select power-ups from the power meter located at the bottom of the screen. However, this installment is probably the first one to offer an edit mode that allows the player to fully customize the power meter as he wishes. At the beginning of the game, players can choose their favorite power configuration out of a pool of eligible items - they include several different missiles (normal, hawk wind, 2 way back, small spread), doubles (vectical, double, tail gun, back double, lasers (twin, ripple, energy laser, cyclone Laser, options (option, snake Option, formation option, rolling option), shields (shield, force field, rolling shield, reduce) and specials (speed down, remain option, full barrier, Mega Crush). Gradius III features ten levels and several hidden bonus stages.
