Keef the Thief: A Boy and His Lockpick is a first-person perspective role-playing game. It has elements of parody, clearly identifiable from various descriptions in the game and enemy names during combat. One of the goals in the game is to steal everything in sight - at least in the city. The game map itself includes, beside the city, various dungeons, jungles, and an arena, among others.
