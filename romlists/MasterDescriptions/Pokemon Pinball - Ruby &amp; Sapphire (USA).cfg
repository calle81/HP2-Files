overview It's time to retire your copy of Pokémon Pinball for the Game Boy Color and upgrade to Pokémon Pinball: Ruby &amp; Sapphire for Game Boy Advance.  Pokémon Pinball challenges you to rack up huge Hi-Scores as you catch over 200 Pokémon from Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire.  Use the fast flippers to shoot the Poké Ball at targets on either the Ruby or Sapphire fields and catch your favorite Pokémon.  With the coins you earn during the game, you can visit the Pokémon Mart to purchase special bonus items.  Pokémon Pinball: Ruby &amp; Sapphire is easy to pick up and play, but only true masters will have the skill and determination it takes to catch every last Pokémon.
