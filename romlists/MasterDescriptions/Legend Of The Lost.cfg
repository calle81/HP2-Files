overview Legend of the Lost has seven levels in total, with you controlling Jack in his attempt to rescue Jane. 
 
The intention of Legend Of The Lost is to recreate the old B-movies of the 30s. However, thanks to some dull presentation and a batch of dull sub-games, it just doesn't hold together. Graphically, the game is unimpressive, with small sprites and basic animation, and the overall impression given is one of an 8-bit game. Very average graphics. The sprite detection seems to be a bit iffy on the first level, and the game really slows down in the fifth. A tune plays while you make you way through the game, but although it's not too bad it really starts to get on your nerves after a while. 
 
It has all the makings of a good game, but unfortunately it doesn't manage to addict you in the slightest. Each of the game's seven levels just fail to grab your attention and the only reason you continue to play, is that it is really easy and you can tell that you will probably beat it in the first day. The cartoon strip is a nice idea, but is to slow and the humor is very poor. Unfortunately, Legend of the Lost is hardly the stuff Amigas were made for.
