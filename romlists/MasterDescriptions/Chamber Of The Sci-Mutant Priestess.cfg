overview "Wow, what a weird plot and if that wasn’t surreal enough the wonderfully detailed graphics add even more to the superb atmosphere as do the creaking sound effects and simulated speech (and no, it isn’t Welsh!). Some of the characters encountered are truly bizarre – ever tried making love to a spider woman? The puzzles themselves are very cryptic indeed but there is much more to the game with underground caverns to explore and your girlfriend to rescue while you avoid being chopped up on the sacrificial altar! The icon system is extremely easy to use and an extra tactical element is introduced in using the useful psi powers. A brilliantly implemented science-fiction adventure with wide-ranging appeal." - Zzap! (Sep, 1989)
