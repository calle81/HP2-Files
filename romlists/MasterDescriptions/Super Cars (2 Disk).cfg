***Super Cars*** is a top-view racing game from Gremlin Interactive,  
who later produced the Lotus series of games. Stylistically, the game  
is influenced by Super Sprint. 
 
 
 
 
There are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be  
raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder  
than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on temporary  
handling and power upgrades, plus armour plating and front/rear shooting  
missiles that can knock out other racers. The player must finish in the  
top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer  
opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game. 
 
 
 
 
The car can be upgraded throughout the game via the shop section. The  
player is given an initial price, but also a number of options of things  
to say to the salesman - with the right combination, the price will  
drop. 
 
 
 
 
An unusual easter egg was featured in the game, whereby typing in a  
certain swear word in the name screen will reset the game.
