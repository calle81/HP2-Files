***Ghostbusters II*** is the title of a video game released for several home  
computer and console systems. The game is loosely based on the film of  
the same name. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All home computer editions were published by Activision. Each home  
computer game edition of the game is essentially similar, with changes  
in the quality of graphics and sound.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The DOS version is completely different from the other ones, having been  
developed by a different company, Dynamix with game design by  
Doug Barnett.

Most version of the game feature several arcade sequences based on the  
film: Van Horne: the player controls Ray Stantz as he is lowered into  
an air shaft of the disused Van Horne subway system to collect a  
sample of slime. He is armed with his proton pack and other weaponry  
with which to defend himself against the myriad of ghosts that attack:  
some will collide or grab him and cause damage, while others will  
attempt to cut his rope. The player must collect the three segments  
of the slime scoop, as well as ammo and health, during the descent.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Journey to the Museum: the Statue of Liberty has been brought to life  
by "mood slime" and is marching toward the Metropolitan Museum of Art;  
the player controls a floating fireball (generated from the Statue's  
torch) which fires horizontal shots and must be used to protect the  
Statue from swarms of ghosts. Impacts from ghosts (or regeneration  
of the fireball) uses up precious slime, though it can be replenished  
from destroyed ghosts.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Showdown in the Museum: the player controls the four Ghostbusters  
individually, armed variously with proton packs and slime dispensers,  
in an isometric 3D level. The four heroes must rappel into the Museum  
and fight Janosz, Vigo the Carpathian, and finally a possessed Ray,  
in order to save the world.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Some versions also feature a sequence based on the courtroom fight  
against the ghosts of the Scoleri Brothers.
