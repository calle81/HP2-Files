overview Players can start the game in Free mode and choose from three different fishing spots. The majority of the action is experienced in the Season mode, however, where you are challenged to maintain a fishing career. From the Aqua Lodge menu screen, you will be able to travel between three different rooms: your work desk, the fish tank room, and the stock corner. At your desk, you can read "Fish Find" magazine for more information on how to catch fish, or you can search through your lure and fly organizer (empty at the beginning of the game).
