overview Unrefined sugar, flour, ginger and heat have combined magically to produce consciousness and mobility in a delicious culinary confection. You, a Gingerbread Man, find yourself baking in a gas-fired oven, and you must find a way out! Gingerbread Man is based loosely on the popular children?s story of the same name. And although this game is appropriate for children, it?s not child?s play!
