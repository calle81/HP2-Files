overview The third and final arcade outing for Bub and Bob (not counting the 'Puzzle Bobble' series), Bubble Memories returns once more to the classic, single-screen gameplay of the series' legendary first outing. Graphically, the game is very similar to 'Bobble Bobble II', released a year earlier; the only real visual difference between the two is the latter game's use of some rather charmless digitized animal photographs that form the game's backdrops.One new gameplay addition, however, is the introduction of 'Super Bubbles'; There are now two sizes of bubble. Hold down the bubble button for about 1 second until you glow to produce a giant bubble. This giant bubble can trap either a single large enemy, or several smaller enemies. This replaces the 'Multiple Bubble' facility of the previous game in the series; 'Bubble Bobble II'.
