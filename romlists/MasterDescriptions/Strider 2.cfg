***Strider II*** (released in North America under the title of Journey  
from Darkness: Strider Returns), is a side-scrolling platform game  
published by U.S. Gold (under license from Capcom USA) and originally  
released for various computer platforms in 1990. It is a  
European-developed sequel to Capcom's arcade game Strider, which  
U.S. Gold previously ported to home computers in Europe. The game  
was developed by Tiertex, as with Human Killing Machine, the U.S. Gold   
sequel to Street Fighter. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Strider II was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST,  
Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Strider II was later  
remade for the Mega Drive and Master System in 1992. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the computer versions of Strider II the objective of the game is to  
rescue the Princess of Planet Magenta from a terrorist group that are  
keeping her captive. The controls in the computer version are similar  
to U.S. Gold's home computer ports of the original Strider, although  
the character cannot slide nor climb ceilings like in the original  
game. However, he can still climb walls, as well as ropes. In addition  
to his cypher, he can also use a rifle whenever he is still standing  
still. If the player has collected enough energy icons throughout each  
stage, they transform into a wheeled robot when confronting the boss  
at the end of each stage. As a robot, the Strider can shoot lasers,  
but cannot jump nor crouch. His robot form has a separate energy gauge  
from his regular energy gauge as a human. When his robot gauge runs  
out, he will transform back to a human. The game consists of five  
stages.
