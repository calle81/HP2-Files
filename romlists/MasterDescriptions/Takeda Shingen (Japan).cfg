overview Takeda Shingen is a side-scrolling brawler released for the Arcade by Jaleco and later converted to the PC Engine by Aicom. It was never localized into English. It features the eponymous daimyo, or warlord, Takeda Shingen as he makes his way across various areas of medieval Japan chopping down all who oppose him with his katana. Fallen foes drop money which can be spent on upgrades and health recovery items between levels.
