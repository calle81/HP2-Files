overview Ruff and Reddy have agreed to test Professor Flipnoodles Pocket Rocket. At blast off, something goes terribly wrong and the rocket spins wildly out of control, heading off into deep space. 
 
It crash lands on a planet inhabited by small blue aliens known as Lilli-Punies. Some of these have decided to go exploring on a nearby planet and have become either lost or captured. The Lilli-Punies kidnap Ruff and Reddy and tell them that the only way to regain their freedom is for Ruff to go and rescue all the missing aliens. Without much of a choice the Lilli-Punies take him to the planet where their friends are. Ruff has to search through four areas of the alien planet, beginning on the surface and working his way underground. Each level comprises of various puzzles to solve and varying amounts of Lilli-Punies to find, 20 in all. 
 
Prepare yourself for the wild and wacky adventures that ensue!
