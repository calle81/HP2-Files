***Ghouls 'n Ghosts*** is a platform game/run and gun developed by  
Capcom and released as an arcade game in 1988, and subsequently ported  
to a number of other platforms. It is the sequel to Ghosts 'n Goblins  
and the second game in the Ghosts 'n Goblins series. 
 
 
 
 
***Gameplay*** 
 
 
 
 
The gameplay for Ghouls 'n Ghosts is similar to that of Ghosts 'n  
Goblins. The player controls the knight Arthur, who must advance  
through a series of eerie levels and defeat a number of undead and  
demonic creatures in his quest to restore the souls stolen by Lucifer  
(Loki in the English-language Mega Drive and Sega Master System  
versions), including the soul of his lover, Princess Prin Prin.  
Along the way, Arthur can pick up a variety of weapons and armor  
to help him in his quest. While the core gameplay remains the same  
as its predecessor, the game now allows Arthur to fire directly  
upward and directly downward while in mid air. 
 
 
 
 
By jumping in certain spots, players can cause a treasure chest to  
erupt from the ground. By firing his weapon at the chest, players may  
uncover new weapons, gold armour or an evil magician that changes  
Arthur into an elderly man or a helpless duck. The gold armour allows  
players to charge up the weapon to release a powerful magical attack.  
Each weapon has its own special attack. 
 
 
 
 
There are five levels and Lucifer's chamber at the end, considered a  
sixth level in itself. To defeat the game, Arthur must complete level  
1 to 5 twice. Upon completing level's 1 to 5 the first time, Arthur is  
taken back to level 1 again but this time a special weapon appears  
during the game. To enter Lucifer's chamber the player must have this  
special weapon equipped and defeat the penultimate boss. 
 
 
 
 
Ports of Ghouls 'n Ghosts were released in Europe in 1989 for the  
Amstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum.  
These ports were all handled by Software Creations and all omit a  
great deal of detail from the arcade version even on very capable  
16-Bit machines like the Amiga.
