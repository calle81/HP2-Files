overview Genpei Touma Den, given the official localization title The Genji and the Heike Clans in a 1997 rerelease, is an 1986 Arcade brawler from Namco and one of the earliest examples of the genre. The player, as the resurrected spirit of historical ninja Taira no Kagekiyo of the Heike clan, must defeat the (now ruling) Genji clan which had wiped out the Heike prior to the game's events. The player runs across the screen slashing enemies and avoiding obstacles from all directions, eventually reaching a torii (shrine gate) that leads to the next level.
