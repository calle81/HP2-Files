overview RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is an adventure game - to win, you must make your way past obstacles to find the Lost Ark. Along the you'll acquire adventure points, which will be scored at the end of the game inside the Well of the Souls.You'll start the game inside the Well of the Souls, on top of a high pedestal. The Ark is shining above you. Soon the pedestal sinks down, the Ark disappears, and your quest begins. The Ark of the Covenant is hidden somewhere in the Valley of Poison, located somewhere outside the Egyptian city of Cairo. The Valley of Poison is studded with towering mesas, one of which holds the Well of the Souls and the Ark. Each time you restart the game, the Well of the Souls is placed randomly inside one of the mesas. Therefore, the Ark will probably not be located in the same mesa from game to game.To reach the secret Map Room, you'll first need to enter the cavernous Temple of the Ancients, where you'll pick up objects to help you on your journey. Next, you'll need to leave the Temple, and search for the Map Room itself. Inside the Map Room is a scale model of the Mesa Field, as well as a heiroglyphic on the wall. The heiroglyphic shows the object you must hold in order to unlock the secrets of the Map Room.Your journey to the Ark is a dangerous one: you are given three lives to play the game. Each time you are killed, you will slowly disappear from the screen, feet first. If you have any lives remaining, you will reappear and continue playing the game. If no lives remain, the game ends and you must start the game over again by pushing the right controller button. You'll need every ounce of skill you can muster to reach the mesa containing the Well of the Souls. Find your way into the mesa and the secret chamber, and you'll win the game and save you're country! Good luck, Indy!
