overview Beware of scavenging pirates trying to steal your precious fuel cells! The more pirates you destroy, the faster their successors become. Guard your tanks carefully... you are always outnumbered!You can select any of the 16 different game play options. Each game play option determines the number of available fuel cells and which characters can wraparound the screen.Your pirate-destroying ship will appear on the right side of the screen. In a two player game, a second pirate-destroying ship will appear on the left side of the screen.  Your fuel cells will be in the center. You must guard your fuel cells from the pirates who will try to steal them. The pirates can appear from anywhere on the screen. Steer your ship with either the joystick or buttons 1 and 2, for left and right rotation. Move your ship forward by pressing button 3. Press button 4 to fire lasers at the pirates. The pirates can be destroyed by colliding with them, but you will then have to wait for your new pirate-destroying ship to appear before you can fire more lasers. The game is over when all the fuel cells are stolen.
