overview AX-101 on Mega-CD is a first person futuristic shoot'em up where your goal is to protect humanity from UFO attacks. The player pilots a spaceship and has to handle cannon during space, air - and sometimes underground - battles. 3 kinds of weapons are available: simple cannon, reloaded cannon (way more powerful) and a limited stock of bombs (to be handled carefully).
