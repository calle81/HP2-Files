overview In RPG Maker, players with absolutely no programming experience or prior game-production skills can make their own role-playing quests and save them to the PlayStation memory card for themselves or a friend to enjoy. The world creation in the game is tile-based, and the entire game is done in the 2D style of 16-bit era RPGs. Players can create characters, towns, dungeons and script action to move along at a certain pace. They will place treasures, enter dialogue and create events that are triggered by certain actions within the game world.
