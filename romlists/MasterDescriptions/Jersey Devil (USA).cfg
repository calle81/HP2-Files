overview Jersey Devil, as the title implies, is loosely based upon the legendary New Jersey beast of the same name. Instead of the horrific beast the legend describes, the protagonist of the title is cute purple creature with long-ears and small wings. Dr. Knarf -- the villain of the piece -- has created a legion of mutated vegetables to do his evil bidding, and it falls to Jersey Devil to stop the maniacal scientist. 
 
To do this, the purple protagonist must venture through a series of 3D platform stages spread across themed environments such as a museum, cemetery, forest, and even a haunted house. Endowed with an ample set of abilities, Jersey Devil must jump, glide, and tail whip his way through the hordes of vegetables and undead minions, the latter comprising such mainstays as zombies, bats, and spiders.
