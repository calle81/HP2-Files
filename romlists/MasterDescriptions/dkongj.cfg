overview Here is the Famicom port of Nintendo's arcade classic Donkey Kong. Do we still need to introduce the universally beloved barrel-throwing gorilla? Donkey Kong, a large and angry ape, has kidnapped Pauline and climbed to the top of a tall and perilous construction site, where he keeps her prisoner. Without hesitation, her boyfriend Mario, a little mustached carpenter with red overalls, a blue shirt and a hat, flies to her rescue. The little man is the gorilla's original caretaker and he is also ready to teach the large ape a good lesson that he will not soon forget... The player must guide Mario through three different stages and eventually rescue Pauline. But the task won't be easy and Kong will do anything to protect and uphold what now belongs to him. In the first screen, Mario must run up a series of metallic girders while avoiding barrels that the ape throws down at him. The first barrel also ignites an oil drum located at the bottom of the screen, which in turn generates fireballs that go chase after Mario. Although the carpenter can only jump, avoid enemies or climb up ladders, he nevertheless has a way to defend himself - hammers are sometimes available and can be used as improvised weapons for a short amount of time, and crush anything that dares cross their path. The second screen features elevators, evil bouncing springs and wandering fireballs, as well as two bonus items - Pauline's umbrella and purse that the player can collect for extra points. Finally, the third screen is made out of four large platforms hold in places by eight yellow rivets. Mario must run or jump over all eight rivets to make them disappear, forcing the large construction to collapse and then trapping the giant gorilla, thus rescuing Pauline from her predicament.
