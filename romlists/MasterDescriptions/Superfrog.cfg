overview Superfrog is a traditional jump & run platformer. You’re – surprise – a frog. Your enemies are all animals – like bees, hedgehogs or snails. You have no weapons. The only way to kill the enemies is to jump on them. Every stage has a time limit. In this limit you have to collect a pre-determined number of coins. Each of the six worlds has four stages. Every stage has a password. After all you can type your name into a high score table.
