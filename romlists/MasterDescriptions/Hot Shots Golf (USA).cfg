overview Everybody's Golf has great playability, using cartoon-style characters rather than realistic-looking players - it should especially attract younger players. This is done without compromising the game mechanics and physics however, which remain as lifelike as the real thing. Each of the ten characters possess an individual blend of skills and attributes, which players can use to their best advantage over a number of different courses and competitions. This unique approach to golf offers something for everybody - Everybody's Golf!
