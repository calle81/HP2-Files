***Gameplay*** 
 
 
 
 
Gauntlet III is an original game with an isometric projection type  
view that would later be used in Gauntlet Legends and other Gauntlet  
games made after Legends. Its view is much like that of Solstice and  
games made with the Filmation engine. The player walks around various  
areas of each kingdom, with five areas for each of the eight kingdoms  
giving a total of 40 areas.[4] The locations can be traversed from one  
area to the next. Places like the forest and castle dungeons have  
obstacles such as logs and tables blocking the player's path,  
creating a maze-like area. Each area has at least one doorway  
or pathway to the next. At times certain things must be done  
in order to advance into the next area. To avoid the player being  
lost the programers created a hand that appears from time to time,  
holding a note to remind the player what they are supposed to do; this  
clue feature is also an option to call up the clues. Another feature  
programed into the game is a combination lock key code for which the  
player must consult a code wheel packaged with the game, needed to  
open certain doors; if someone made a pirated version of the game  
they wouldn't be able to get past that portion of the game without  
the Combination Key. 
 
 
 
 
The enemies in this version, as in other Gauntlet games, come mostly  
from generators that keep producing the enemies until the generators  
are destroyed. 
 
 
 
 
Other elements from the series also make an appearance, such as  
potions that make enemies disappear or weaken them, food (both good  
and poisonous), invincibility amulets, and treasure chests, some of  
which can contain traps or other items the player would need.
