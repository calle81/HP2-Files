overview Antheads: It Came from the Desert II is an add-on for It Came From the Desert. The story takes place five years after the original game. You are Brick Nash, who has stolen plutonium and prevented nuclear tests in the desert, so the people are mad at you because they didn't get any money but some are friendly like Biff and Dusty. The police are after you and people in Lizard Breath are turning into antheads. The gameplay remains unchanged from the base game.
