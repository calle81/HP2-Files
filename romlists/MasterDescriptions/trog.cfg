overview This is the second game Dave parsons wrote for the Amiga. It is a fairly short, sideways-scrolling game in the Wonderboy style. It uses pixel-perfect collision detection routines and runs in 32-colour mode. It was revisited later and made into a much more colourful [AGA version](/amiga/trog-aga) which has 64 colours, much smoother sky colours and screen fades, and a 1-bit parallax background layer.
