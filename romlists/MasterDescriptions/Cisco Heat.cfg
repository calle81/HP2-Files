The player takes on the role of an officer who must race his squad car  
through San Francisco in an attempt to win the first ever  
'National Championship Police Car Steeplechase'. The gameplay is similar  
to that of other contemporary racing games, with a two-speed shifter  
and a chase view. It includes sights such as the famous trams and the  
Golden Gate Bridge. The player can pick from two cars, a Ford LTD Crown  
Victoria-lookalike police car and a Nissan 300ZX turbo-lookalike police  
car.

In late 1991, versions for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC,  
ZX Spectrum and PC were developed by ICE Software and released by Image  
Works, shortly before the Robert Maxwell-owned company folded. Stuart  
Campbell suggested that the Amiga version he played had little in  
common with the arcade game, but was a good game in its own right.
