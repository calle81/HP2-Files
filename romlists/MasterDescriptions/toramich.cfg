overview Tora-he no Michi is a side scrolling action game by Capcom and conversion of the arcade game of the same name. Lee Wong is a young monk and a student of the Oh-Lin school of martial arts. He's also a master of the legendary Oh-Lin Tiger techniques. One day, the warriors of the Dragon God went to rob the four secret scrolls from the Oh-Lin temple and kidnapped all the children from the village. The bald and axe-swinging monk doesn't have much choice; he must now go through five long areas, and save the children and reclaim the Oh-Lin scrolls. Lee comes equipped with an axe - a weapon of limited range and accuracy. However, more weapons can be collected along the way by cracking open treasure chests and statues. The two other available weapons are the Mace (weak but covers a large area) and the Spear (fast but short range). Other special items are also available for the taking - Health Bottles, Invincibility Crystal Balls, Lives, keys (to unlock special doors) or Capcom's trademark POW icon which upgrades Lee's current weapon. Each area is divided into sub-levels and some even branch out and allow players to fight different bosses. Interestingly, each area ends with a small training session where the monk can improve his fighting skills and techniques. There, Lee can gain extra health or learn a new and powerful Tiger Attack. The monk has few more tricks up his sleeves and parts of the game feature vertical-scrolling flying stages. Finally, Tora-he no Michi has a save feature and allows the player to continue from the last visited sub-stage, but a device with built-in backup RAM is necessary (such as a CD-ROM unit or a Tennokoe 2 Bank).
