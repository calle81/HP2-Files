overview Designed by educators, Rayman Brain Games for PlayStation incorporates learning activities into an adventure game starring the established character Rayman. Based on standard curriculums, the title introduces math skills, numeral recognition and place value, phonics, spelling, and reading as part of a multi-level game similar in play to the original Sonic The Hedgehog. Players will take Rayman through 12 adventure games, each with five levels, in search of The Wizard's Magic Book of Knowledge stolen by Mister Dark. Upon successfully completing an activity, a piece of the parchment, which in whole reveals the location of Mister Dark's hideout, is awarded.
