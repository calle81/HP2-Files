overview Like previous Pokémon games, Emerald challenges you to collect, trade, and battle Pokémon. In this extension of Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Sapphire, you must stop Team Magma and Team Aqua from expanding and taking over the world of Hoenn. Help maintain the balance by bringing your strategies and tactics onto all-new battlefields. In addition to single-player challenges, the game features multiplayer trading and battling with up to four players using a wireless adapter.
