overview Strike Gunner is a vertical shooter and adaptation of Tecmo's arcade game originally released in 1991. The action takes place in 2008, as an armada of enemy ships enter the Earth atmosphere and wreaks havoc on its path. Mark and Jane, two elite pilots, have been selected to save the day, and fly their fighter-jets deep behind enemy lines. But before diving into battle and fighting off endless waves of enemy fighters, the player must select a secondary weapon from a extensive list of fifteen : Shield Unit, Homing Missiles, Atomic Missiles, Laser Cannon and so forth. But they come with a twist, and the selected weapon can only be used once per level (as long as its energy bar is full), and another one must be selected for any upcoming level. This certainly adds a lot of strategy to the game, and the player must constantly decide which weapon to equip early in his mission, and which one to save for later stages. The main weapon, a simple vulcan-gun, can nevertheless be slowly upgraded during the game. Strike Gunner also includes a simultaneous two player option.
