***Ghosts 'n Goblins*** is a 1985 side-scrolling platform game developed  
by Capcom for video arcades and has since been released on several other  
platforms. It is the first game in the Ghosts 'n Goblins franchise. 
 
 
 
 
***Gameplay*** 
 
 
 
 
Ghosts 'n Goblins is a platform game where the player controls a  
knight, named Sir Arthur, who must defeat zombies, ogres, demons,  
cyclops, dragons and other monsters in order to rescue Princess Prin  
Prin, who has been kidnapped by Satan, king of Demon World. Along the  
way the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses and extra suits of  
armour that can help in this task. 
 
 
 
 
The game is often considered very difficult by arcade standards and is  
commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games ever released.  
The game is considered by Gametrailers.com to be the world's second  
most difficult game ever made. The player can only be hit twice  
before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur's armour, and the  
player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level,  
or finding replacement armour). If the player loses a life, he is  
returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has  
managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a  
certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock  
being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the  
player instantly loses that life. 
 
 
 
 
After defeating the final boss, but only with the cross weapon  
(if the player does not have the cross weapon, they will be prompted  
that it is needed to defeat the boss and restart at the beginning of  
level 5 and must repeat round 5 and 6 again regardless if the weapon  
is obtained immediately or not) for the first time the player is  
informed that the battle was "a trap devised by Satan". The player  
must then replay the entire game on a higher difficulty level to  
reach the genuine final battle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Commodore 64 version, released in 1986, is known for its music by  
Mark Cooksey, which borrows from Frédéric Chopin's Prelude No. 20. Due  
to the limited resources on the Commodore 64, it was somewhat different  
from the arcade version. It only features the Graveyard and Forest, The  
Ice Palace, The Floating Platforms and Firebridge and The Caves in that  
order. The player also starts the game with five lives. The demon that  
kidnapped the princess replaces Astaroth in the title screen.  
Additionally, the cyclops (or "Unicorn") is the boss of levels one to  
three and the dragon is the final boss. 
 
 
 
 
Ghosts 'n Goblins was also ported to the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX,  
Atari ST, IBM PC compatibles.
