***Final Fight*** is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up produced by Capcom.  
Originally released as an arcade game in 1989, it was the seventh  
title released for the CP System hardware. Set in the fictional  
Metro City, the player controls one of three characters—former pro  
wrestler and newly elected mayor Mike Haggar, his daughter's boyfriend  
Cody, and Cody's best friend Guy—as they set out to defeat the Mad  
Gear gang and rescue Haggar's young daughter Jessica. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The game began development as a sequel to the original Street Fighter  
released in 1987, but the genre was switched from a fighting game to  
a beat 'em up and the title was changed following the success of  
Double Dragon. The Final Fight development team later worked on the  
original Street Fighter II and some of the characters from Final Fight  
later appeared as playable fighters in other entries of the franchise  
such as the Street Fighter Alpha sub-series. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Final Fight was ported to various home consoles such as the  
Super Nintendo Entertainment System and was followed by a few  
sequels. The total sales of the Final Fight series have totalled  
3.4 million units. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
U.S. Gold released ports of Final Fight for the Amiga, Atari ST,  
Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC for the European market in  
1991. These ports were developed by Creative Materials. In February  
1993, the ZX Spectrum version was released as part of the Super Fighter 
compilation with Pit Fighter and WWF WrestleMania.
