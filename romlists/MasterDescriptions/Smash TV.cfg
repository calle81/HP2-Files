***Smash TV***, known as Super Smash TV on some other versions, is a 1990 
arcade game created by Eugene Jarvis and Mark Turmell for Williams. It is 
 a run and gun game in the same vein as its predecessor, Robotron: 2084  
(also produced by Jarvis). As in the previous game, players battle waves  
of enemies by using guns; the arcade version even uses the two-joystick  
control system of Robotron. The plot of Smash TV revolves around a  
futuristic game show in which players compete for various prizes, as  
well as their lives.

The play mechanic is very similar to that of Eugene Jarvis' earlier  
Robotron: 2084, with dual-joystick controls and series of single screen  
areas. The theme of the game, borrowed from The Running Man, involves  
players competing in a violent game show, set in the then future year of  
1999. Moving from one room to the next within the studio/arena, players  
have to shoot down hordes of enemies as they advance from all sides,  
while at the same time collecting weapons, power-up items, and  
assorted bonus prizes until a final show down with the show's host  
where players are finally granted their prizes, life and freedom.  
Among the game's items are keys – if enough keys are collected,  
players can access a bonus level called the Pleasure Dome.
