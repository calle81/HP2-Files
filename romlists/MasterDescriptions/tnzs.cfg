overview The New Zealand Story is a platform game by Taito, conversion of their own arcade game. Two kiwis called Tiki and Phee-Phee live peacefully with their friends. But one day, a gigantic leopard seal appears from nowhere and stuffs all the poor birds in his giant bag to sell them on the black market. Tiki manages to escape his captor and decides to help his friends. But our hero is not your traditional Kiwi - He comes equipped with a bow and arrows and special items can get him to throw bombs, fire lasers and even steal and ride his opponents' flying vehicles. Stages are vast and warp-doors scattered around them help our Kiwi friend in his long journey.
