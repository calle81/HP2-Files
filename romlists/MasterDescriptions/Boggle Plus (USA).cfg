overview Create words at home or on the road with Boggle Plus for Game Boy. Based on Parker Brothers' classic board game, which challenges you to create words from randomly generated letter cubes, Boggle Plus also includes additional play variants. "Big Boggle" offers additional letters, while "Anagrams" involves unscrambling jumbled words. "Categories" has you searching for words based on a specific theme, and "Use All" involves forming words with every letter displayed on the screen. Boggle Plus includes a built-in dictionary with 35,000 words and supports head-to-head play via Game Link Cable.
