overview Gradius II is an horizontal shooter by Konami and conversion of their hit arcade game originally release in 1988. The Bacterion Empire has risen from its own ashes and is once more spreading doom and destruction throughout the universe. Led by the evil Gofer, the alien invasion now hits full swing and must be immediately stopped. The Vic Viper is back in service and ready to take on the upcoming threat. Gradius II retains the power-meter originally used in Gradius - the player collects power-pods left behind by orange enemies and moves onto the next available power-up from the meter. Upgrades range from Speed Up, Missiles, Double Shots, Multiples, Lasers and Shield. Unlike Gradius, this sequel offers four different power-meter configurations (available at the beginning of the game) which feature new weapons to choose from, such as the Tail Gun, Spread Bombs, Photo Torpedoes, Ripple Lasers and so forth. It also adds its own twist to the power system though, and some weapons can be activated twice for additional power - for instance, Missiles and Doubles can receive one upgrade each and Multiples can rotate around the Vic Viper for a short amount of time. Gradius II consists of seven stages and features an alternating two-player mode.
