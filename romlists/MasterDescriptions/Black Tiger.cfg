***Black Tiger***, known in Japan as Black Dragon, is a 1987 platform  
game released for the arcades by Capcom. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A barbarian hero jumps and fights his way through a variety of  
colourful, enemy-packed levels. The sprawling, eight-way scrolling,  
two-dimensional levels are packed with hidden bonuses to encourage  
and reward exploration. Though a percentage of these bonuses consist  
of dubious and often self-evident "advice", most come in the form of  
"Zenny coins", currency that allows the player to buy such items as an  
upgrade to their weapons and armour, keys for treasure chests, and  
anti-poisoning potions. Special items that reveal coins, upgraded  
armour, full vitality, extra lives, extra time, or simply bonus  
points may be found by attacking certain walls. The player's vitality  
bar will also increase up to three times as a reward for reaching  
score benchmarks. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Japanese version has a few changes that makes it more challenging  
than its American counterpart. Several of the "falling rock" obstacles  
were added in this version. Additionally, the prices of many of the  
items are higher and more points are needed to increase maximum  
vitality. But perhaps the biggest difference is related to fighting  
the later bosses (the three dragons and the dual sword-wielding foes  
at the end of stages 5 and 7). In the American version, it is possible  
to duck and avoid taking damage when the bosses touch the player's  
character as long as one of their projectiles does not hit him.  
In the Japanese version, the player is not able to do this.
