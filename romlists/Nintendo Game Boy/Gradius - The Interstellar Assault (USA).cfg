overview YOU'RE CORDIALLY INVITED TO THE GALAXY'S HOTTEST COOKOUT! 
 
Smell the challenge, as the flames of destruction scorch your courage and ignite your fears. Just when you thought life was cool, the Bacterion Beast Squadron launches a massive counterattack that makes all other intergalactic battles seen like picnics. These plutonian chow hounds are starving for a victory. And if you're not careful, they'll char your hide, then serve you up like a stuffed Sarubian Space Pig!
