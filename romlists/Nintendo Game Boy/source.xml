	<path>./Addams Family, The - Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a side-scrolling platformer based on the second animated TV series The Addams Family (1992). The entire Addams family is being held captive by various monsters throughout the mansion, and Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in various parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest, which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards: Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies.

This version of the game is heavily based on the SNES version of The Addams Family - it features the same storyline with another main character and almost identical level design. Another difference to the SNES version of this game is that Pugsley can only take two hits before dying - but there is an additional power-up that makes him faster and gives him an extra hit.

	<path>./Addams Family, The (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The Addams Family is a side-scrolling platformer based on the movie of the same name. The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest or the graveyard, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. In contrast to the other versions of the game he has weapons to his disposal, e.g. a throwing knife. Other differences are a unique level design and another health system: Gomez has five hearts which practically act like a life meter because every hit only takes away a part of a heart.</desc>

	<path>./Adventures of Lolo (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>As Lolo, king of eden land, you have to puzzle your way through numerous screen-sized rooms. In each room, you have to collect all heart frames in order to open a treasure chest which contains the key to the exit. 

Different terrain types and enemies have to be avoided or used to your advantage to get all the heart frames. Some enemies don't hurt you at all, others only awaken once all heart frames are collected. Some shoot you as soon you cross their line of sight, then there are enemies that fall asleep and stay where they are once you touch them. 

Terrain types include grass that enemies cannot cross, sand that slows you down, but not the enemies, stones that cannot be crossed but also block enemy shots, trees that cannot be crossed but don not block enemy shots, water that can only be crossed with a bridge or an egg, arrows that cannot be crossed in the direction opposite that of which they are facing and others. 

Some heart frames give Lolo the ability to turn enemies into eggs and push them around like boxes. Eggs can be used to cross water, trap enemies or block their shots. In some levels, collecting two heart frames gives Lolo access to one of three items. These items are: A hammer that crushes stones, a bridge that can be used to cross water and an arrow that changes the direction an arrow tile is facing.

At the end of each level you receive a password.</desc>

The side-scrolling shooter pits you against a host of different alien creatures across the galaxy. You'll start inside the mech itself, collecting weapon upgrades along the way to increase your chances of defeating the alien scum.

	<path>./Alien vs Predator - The Last of His Clan (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In the year 2593, on the planet Alpha Centauri 3, Predators looking for a hunting ground plant Alien eggs. The Aliens soon hatch and wipe out the human population. However, when the Predators move in for the hunt, they find they are vastly outnumbered and suffer the same fate. Only one of them survives. He theorizes that among the hatched Aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of Aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan.

The Predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors. Various weapons are available: the standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area. A small radar map helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and also displays approaching enemies.

	<path>./A-mazing Tater (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This successor to Kwirk  is a puzzle-game with a simple premise but very challenging gameplay. The player has to guide a small potato to the exit of each level, which is made difficult by a number of obstacles. Crates have to be pushed out of the way or into holes to make them traversable, however, since there are crates and holes in several different shapes and sizes, this is much more difficult than it seems at first. Furthermore, many levels contain different types of spinning doors that make solving the levels even more complicated.

The game features four different modes of play: a Beginners Mode in which the basics are explained and the player receives hints on how to solve each level; a Practice Mode that lets the player choose the size of the levels which are than randomly picked; a Puzzle Mode in which the player has to complete 40 levels and receives a score depending on the time it took him to complete a level; and finally Action Mode, which is basically a Story Mode containing two stories. The game also features a password-system and four different difficulty levels.</desc>

	<desc>Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as it's later counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn't offer a 2 player mode and level codes were added only for the GameBoy Color version.

To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted.

There's an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!</desc>

	<desc>Atomic Punk, which was released as Dynablaster in Europe and Bomber Boy in Japan, is a game from Hudson Soft's Bomberman series. 

The game offers two single player and two multiplayer modes. The single player mode called "Game B" has the classical Bomberman gameplay, while the mode "Game A" introduces several variations. The levels in Game A are divided in nine areas, which can be accessed in any order from a world map. Depending on the time taken to finish a level and the number of blocks destroyed, the player gets a certain amount of gold, which can be used to buy power-ups (called "panels" in the game) in shop, which in term is accessed from the map. Power-ups allow, for example, to revive Bomberman when he dies in a stage or to increase the length of an explosion. Before entering a new area, the player chooses which panels to use in order to complete the area.

The multiplayer mode are both player vs. player modes. In "Panel mode", each player can place only one bomb at a time and the bombs' radius starts at one, but panels appear in the field to improve this. In "Powerful mode", no panels appear, but each player can place up to four bombs at a time and the radius is four.</desc>

During his journey he must fight through legions of mutant tomatoes, although this is a feat he will take on alone as the citizens of San Zucchini are too afraid of the mutant tomatoes to aid him.
Much like other platform games of its time, the main method of killing the enemies is to jump on them, in this case squashing them, or breaking them into smaller tomato enemies. There are several bosses to take on including Zoltan, Beefstake, Mummato, Fang, Ketchuck and Tomacho.</desc>

In side-scrolling fashion, the game features six different stages - the city, the rooftops, a factory, the city sewers and two levels dealing with the mobsters base of operation. The player is able to possess enemies, 20 in all, and use any skills or weapons they have, to complete the level. The player's health is represented by ghost energy and it is drained when he is not inside a host. The story leads to two different endings.</desc>

	<desc>Balloon Kid is a unique side-scrolling platform game. You control a little girl who's brother has floated away on a big bunch of balloons. It's up to you to chase after him through 8 treacherous levels.  Instead of the usual jumping from platform to platform, you have a pair of balloons that allow you to float through the level. You must control your height carefully by tapping the 'A' button. Meanwhile, the screen is always scrolling to the left, and you have to keep up.

In addition to the single player adventure, there is a 2-player mode that allows you to compete against a friend via the Game Boy link cable. In this mode you try to get your opponent to maneuver their balloon kid into the various level hazards.</desc>

	<desc>The East and the West square off for nine innings of hard hitting baseball in Bases Loaded for the Nintendo Game Boy.  Experience the action as pitchers battle it out against a lineup of heavy hitters using fast, slow, curving and special pitches.  Each player brings their own unique stats and abilities to the game as you work your way through progressively more challenging teams.

This portable version of Bases Loaded is loosely based on the title for the original NES. In this scaled down version Major League teams are replaced with two teams representing the East and West Coast Divisions. With two Game Boy units and a Video Link cable players can go head to head - although each player will also need their own game cartridge. Single players can enjoy a quick pickup game by selecting an unofficial game of 1 to 9 innings. An official game will allow a victorious team to move on to consecutive matches against progressively more challenging teams, a feature that substitutes for the traditional 'Season Mode' of most baseball titles. But you'll have to do this in a single sitting as no battery save option was included.

Play in USA or Japan mode for a subtle change in the gameplay or learn how to best utilize the strengths of the East and West teams. Pitchers are rated 1 to 5 and batters get a rating for both running speed and hitting ability.</desc>

	<desc>The Joker lives again in SunSoft's sequel to their NES 
original. The Joker has somehow managed to escape from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must fight him across seven stages to restore peace to Gotham City.

Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets by default. This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses. 

Boss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes.

Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, military base, and sewers. Two levels require you to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep pace in the background. Some levels also have Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short side-scrolling shooter. 

This game is one of the few Batman games that was not based directly on a movie or television series.

The player's arsenal includes a lot of nifty bat-gadgets and a collection of fighting moves that are unleashed with special button combinations.

The graphics were rendered completely with digitized actors and objects, but none of the actors from the movie make an appearance in the game.</desc>

The game features three possible gameplay modes: 1P Game (story mode), Vs. Computer and Vs. Human. The story mode is slightly different from the console version, featuring a different unlockable final boss.

As in the console version, battles can be won either by depleting the adversary's life bar or by tossing him or her out of the ring. Each character has its own special moves and a desperation move (which can only be used when the character has 10% or less of his or her health).</desc>

Just like in Zelda II, there is a top-down map of Greece with towns and other locations to explore. Each of these has side-scrolling sections in which Orpheus fights his way through the minions of Hades. There are various items one must get to continue to the next location, including swords, shields and crystals. There are three fragments of love hidden around; Orpheus has to find them before he can enter Tartarus and fight Hades to save his beloved Helene.

The object of the game is to build all the hamburgers in each stage by dropping all the makings of each burger into completed stacks at the bottom of the screen.

As you go about your burger building business, Food Foes Mr. Pickle, Mr. Egg and Mr. Hot dog (also known as Frank N. Furter) will chase after you.

You can also pick up bonus points (in the guise of cups and saucers) and extra lives.

	<desc>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves.

If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:

1. One Player
Two Player Alternating
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.
Dual Player Competition
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.
Team Play
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.

Scoring
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:

Centipede Head - 100 points
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points

To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences.

Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".</desc>

	<desc>Take off on a dangerous rescue mission in a world on the brink of all-out global war. Hostages must be saved from a sly and sinister enemy in order to avert total chaos. Only your skill can save us now.

You command the AH 90 Commanche attack helicopter, the ultimate fighting machine. Your arsenal includes: machine guns, flame throwers, missiles and invisibility. Superior technology must be used wisely against the omnipresent enemy. Antagonists attack with everything they've got: bullets, missiles, tanks, subterranean gun turrets and land mines. Hectic heli-heroics are required to save the hostages and yourself.

ChopLifter II features five stages, each with its own threatening terrain. The game can be played by one or two players.</desc>
	<path>./Choplifter III (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>In this third installment of the Choplifter series, it is once again your job to fly your helicopter through enemy territory to rescue hostages. The helicopter does not only take damage from enemy fire, but also from contact with buildings, trees, walls etc., which makes some levels difficult to navigate.

Enemies can be destroyed by either using the helicopter's standard weapon, or more powerful weapons that can be picked up throughout the levels. The main task of each level however, is picking up a certain number of hostages and taking them to your home base.</desc>

Unfortunately, his peaceful existence is interrupted one day when his wife, Ophelia Rock, is kidnapped by the village wierdo, Gary Gritter.  So, Chuck is rather upset about this whole situation and you have to help him make things right.

The game is a side-scrolling platformer. Chuck fights of a variety of dinosaurs using his belly-buster attack and a jump kick. Occasionally he has to pick up and throw rocks to defeat enemies and allow him to jump to greater heights.</desc>
	<path>./Cliffhanger (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Cliffhanger is based on the 1993 Sylvester Stallone movie. The lead character, Gabe Walker, is an expert in high mountain search and rescue and receives a distress signal from a plane that has crashed nearby. However, the plane is actually loaded with terrorists who hijacked a large shipment of cash. The game consists of side-scrolling action. The hero can walk, run, jump, punch, and kick while jumping. Further, he can perform special feats as the situation requires, such as crossing a rope suspended from 2 cliffs. One of the biggest threats in this game is nature as Gabe must defend against wolves and birds, snow falling off cliffs and structures, and falling rocks.</desc>

	<path>./Cool World (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>A licensed game based on the live action/animation movie "Cool World"

You play Frank Harris and your task is to stop Holli Would from entering the real world.

You accomplish the levels by shooting doodles and collecting coins.

Gameplay is set by 4 World with 4 levels each.

Same as the movie, the game is based in cartoon graphics.</desc>

	<path>./Crystal Quest (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>A mouse-driven game in which the player controls a small, circular spaceship which must travel around the screen collecting crystals. This task is made more difficult by the aliens which constantly swarm out from the portals on both sides of the screen. These can be shot down by the ship's gun (which has unlimited ammo) or eliminated by activating one of the player's limited supply of "smart bombs", which will clear the screen of all current enemies.

The physics of the game were quite unusual for the time; the ship does not simply follow the mouse's movement like a mouse cursor. Rather, it retains its inertia, and must be carefully guided around so it does not crash into anything. Bullets, when fired, travel in the direction of the ship's movement, requiring the player to actually travel toward enemies in order to shoot them down.

This was the first color game for the Macintosh, although it was business-as-usual for the IIgs.</desc>

	<desc>Darkwing Duck is a 2D 3rd person platform game featuring this Disney super-hero, friend of Lauchpad McQuack (the Duck Tales character who worked as a pilot for Scrooge McDuck).

As a decent super-hero, his role is to save the city from his enemies.

Graphics are cartoonish, like other Disney licenses developed by Capcom, but darker.

Gameplay is similar to Mega Man and Duck Tales, in the same jump and run style. Controls are easy to handle.</desc>

	<desc>Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied. This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</desc>

	<desc>Dick Tracy is based on the 1990 film of the same name.  It bears a strong resemblance to the NES release, also from Bandai, but has different levels and lacks the driving and puzzle-solving elements.

Big Boy has escaped from jail and it's up to Detective Tracy to track him down. He must fight, shoot and jump his way through five levels of cronies to face the man himself. Some sections involve negotiating platforms and window sills far above the street, while others involve walking at street level while dodging safes that criminals attempt to drop on you from windows. In all cases, Dick can pummel enemies into submission with his fists or find and use a hand gun, tommy gun or tear gas. The weapons all have very limited ammunition.</desc>
	<path>./Dig Dug (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong (World).zip</path>
	<desc>The big ape has returned in this update of the classic Nintendo arcade game. Although at first it appears to be just a port, the familiar levels from the arcade game are just a prelude to the real platform jumping adventure. Instead of rescuing Pauline at the end of the fourth level, Donkey Kong makes off with her once again!

There are 96 levels spread out over 12 worlds. These levels are much more complex than the originals, featuring scrolling backgrounds, numerous objects to collect, and enemies to avoid. Along the way, you will encounter several "boss" style battles with Donkey Kong, as well.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong Land (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>In a modifiication of Donkey Kong Country, Donkey Kong teams up with his buddy Diddy for new adventures and gorilla antics. Facing high-flying pigs, killer bees, and reptilian Kremlings, the simian duo swings back into action on the Game Boy. The two Kongs each have similar abilities when compared to the SNES game. This game isn't exactly a remake of DKC; for instance, there are new levels and enemies, and Candy Kong does not save your game: instead you must collect all four Kong letters.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong Land 2 (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Donkey Kong has been captured by the evil Kaptain K. Rool. Diddy and Dixie must make their way through more side-scrolling levels in this Game Boy adventure. Fortunately, they will have plenty of help along the way from their friends.

Like Donkey Kong Land, all the graphics in this game are pre-rendered three dimensional models. Gameplay is similar also, and consists of much platform jumping and banana collecting.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong Land III (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>DK and Diddy Kong have left in search of The Lost World after hearing of a contest to find it on the radio.  This leaves Dixie stuck with minding her baby cousin Kiddy Kong.  Frustrated at this, she decides to take Kiddy with her and find The Lost World before everyone else!

As with Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, Dixie Kong takes the lead in the third chapter of the Donkey Kong Land series. Dixie can glide using her hair, and carries barrels over her head. Her partner is the heavy Kiddy, who carries barrels in front of him, and can jump a bit further by somersaulting over platform edges first.

There are also special animal friends that can help the two primates out. Ellie the Elephant can shoot water at enemies, while Enguarde the Swordfish can glide through water with ease. Squawks the Parrot can fly and spit eggs, and Squitter the Spider can shoot webbing as well as use it to create new platforms.

Each level has Bonus Coins and DK Coins tucked well away in the levels. While it's possible to gain an ending without these, to complete the game properly, players must seek them all out and unlock levels of the fabled 'Lost World'. A new feature to the game series is a Time Attack mode - once players finish the game, they can attempt to beat the best time for certain levels.</desc>

Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.</desc>

	<desc>The final game in the trilogy.

Billy and Jimmy Lee are returning from martial arts training when their paths cross a fortune teller. She tells them of a great evil in Egypt, their strongest adversary yet, and how the Rosetta Stones can aid them.

This game features weapon shops where Billy and Jimmy can buy power-ups, tricks, energy and extra lives to aid them in 
their quest.

Power-ups make Billy and Jimmy twice their size, increasing their damage done and range of attack.

The character graphics have changed, moving away from cartoon style graphics to more realistic looking characters.

	<path>./Double Dragon II (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

The electricity bill hasn't been paid in some time, and now Franky need to find the cash to pay it off. The locals have trapped Franky inside the late doctor's private manor, and you (as Franky) must escape and piece together the golden tablet depicting your beautiful girlfriend Bitsy to pay the bills.

Dr. Franken II is a side-scrolling platformer what places you in control of a Frankenstein-like character named Franky. The goal is collect different objects within different levels to put something back together. In order for Franky to recharge his health, you need to find the parts to fix the electricity machine that does it. You will also be taken to exotic locales such as Egypt and the bottom of the ocean to find pieces of Bitsy's golden tablet.

Like its predecessor, there are many trap doors, monsters, and other obstacles that need to be overcome. Keys are needed to unlock new areas of the game, which can be found in the far reaches of the level.</desc>

Dirk must collect all "lifestones" scattered all around the game world (by walking or jumping) to finally save Princess Daphne. The game world is divided in several screens which can be freely navigated and are a little wider than Game Boy's screen. As Dirk moves the screen will scroll and when its limit is reached, it will flick to a new one. To help him move around, Dirk can jump over bumper cars, flying magic hats and other kinds of moving platforms.

Dirk starts with 10 lives which can be lost by falling from high platforms, touching spikes or landing on water or fire. The main theme is somewhat reminiscent from the NES version. The game can be played in two different speeds and can also be played by two players taking turns.

	<desc>Dropzone was the first game to propel Archer Maclean to stardom. The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay.

The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. 

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</desc>

	<path>./Elevator Action (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.

Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:

1. Shooting them with his gun.
2. Kicking them by jumping onto them.
3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.
4. Crushing them with an elevator.

Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.

While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. 

Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.

Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.

If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</desc>

	<desc>Felix The Cat is a platformer based on the famous cartoon character.

The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix' magic bag. Naturally, Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty. 

There are four different types of levels. 

1. Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies using different weapons.

Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.

Levels that take place entirely under water.

Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.

Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life.

The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</desc>

	<path>./Fidgetts, The (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>The Fidgetts is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game in a similar vein as The Lost Vikings. The player can switch between two Fidgetts (cartoon-like animals) to get past obstacles. One of the Fidgetts can jump higher to reach objects or locations otherwise unreachable. Fidgetts can lift and drop items to help them climb over obstacles. Within each level the player must get both Fidgetts to the exit before a time runs out. There's pit traps and enemies that can cause the Fidgetts to loose lives or receive damage.

In between levels the player can play a Breakout variant in which the player controls a paddle at both the top and bottom of the screen. In between the blocks that can be destroyed with the ball are power-ups that can be collected.</desc>
	<path>./FIFA International Soccer (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</desc>

	<path>./Final Fantasy Legend II (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The second in the Final Fantasy Legend series increases the amount of detail over the original in gameplay and graphics.

The major changes are in the character classes and party members. Similar to FFL, starting a game of Legends II allows you to choose your main character from Humans, Monsters, Mutants and a new class: Robots. From here, you build your party of 4 from the same character classes. During gameplay special side-characters will join you in battle to help defeat certain enemies. 

The other improvement is in strategy. In FFL you gain experience points after each battle, increasing strength, etc. In FFLII, you gain different points and abilities depending on how you defeated the enemy. If you win by using a sword, your strength increases. If you use magic, your mana increases. This adds a more strategic approach to defeating enemies.</desc>
	<path>./Final Fantasy Legend III (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The final (no joke) Final Fantasy Legend title to grace the Game Boy, FFLIII tells the story of a great flood which destroys cities in the past, present and future. 
As you control a party of 4, with a choice of human and mutant classes, and travel back and forth through time collecting pieces of the great ship Talon so as to defeat the enemy that has flooded the lands.

The inclusion of a time travel storyline means that whatever you do in one time frame can have an affect on what happens in another time. Other major changes compared to the original 2 in the series are the ability to mutate your characters further and a change to the upgrade system.
Items picked up after battle can be attached to your mutants or humans to turn them into monsters or robots, increasing your parties power and abilities.
And although the original system of obtaning experience points after every battle has been removed, its replacement allows you to choose which magic stone each character can use, so they learn that specific magic type and never lose it.</desc>
	<path>./Final Fantasy Legend, The (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The first 'Final Fantasy' title on the Game Boy, Legend allows you to choose from 8 different characters, from the usual human male or female to zombie, wererat, redbull (not the drink), clipper or mutant male or female. No matter which you choose, the goal stays the same: Increase your experience points and abilities by defeating many varied enemies through-out the land.

Much like the FF series of old (and new), you can choose members to join your party and the quest that lies ahead (either warriors, mutants or creatures). Every character has a limit to the amount of moves available during every battle and experience points are gained after each fight, increasing stamina, power, etc.</desc>

	<desc>The Game &amp; Watch Gallery is Nintendo's first portable compilation featuring their popular line of original 1980's handheld games, featuring the popular "Mr. Game &amp; Watch" himself, as well as Mario and friends.

The compilation consists of four popular titles from the Game &amp; Watch Series, each with a "Classic" and "Modern" version of each game:

1. Octopus: Collects as much treasure as your bag can hold, while avoiding the octopus tentacles that continually swing around you. In the "Modern" version, Mario becomes the diver, and as he collects more treasure, his bag becomes heavier, making it harder to return to the surface. Mario can also delay the octopus tentacles by throwing treasure at them.

Fire: Position your net to catch the falling people jumping from the burning building. The "Modern" version has Mario and Luigi rescuing Toad, Yoshi and Donkey Kong Jr. from Princess Peach's Castle. Each falling character has different weights and falling patterns.

Manhole: The player must cover the holes to keep the continually walking people from falling through the manholes and into the sewers. In the "Modern" version, Yoshi must use his tongue to keep Mario, Toad and Donkey Kong Jr. from falling thought the hole, each character having different speeds and patterns.

Oil Panic: The player must collect the dripping blobs of oil before they slip past and ruin everything. The "Modern" version has Bowser dropping oil blobs at Mario, who has to catch the oil and dump it over to Yoshi before the Koopa King gets the best of Mario.

Each mode (Classic and Modern) has two difficulties: Easy and Hard. The higher score a player gets in each version, new unlockable bonuses will become available via the "Gallery Corner". These bonuses include release dates, pictures and animations which tell in greater detail the history behind Gunpei Yokoi's portable creations.</desc>

	<path>./Game of Harmony, The (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This strategic action puzzle game features original gameplay. You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.</desc>

	<desc>The friendly Ghoul Realm was invaded by aliens know as the Destroyers ages ago.  The Destroyers almost captured the Ghoul Realm except a powerful fire came from the sky and destroyed them.  The Realm is threatened again and the secret of the fire must be recovered.

You play Firebrand, a gargoyle who has powerful claws that allow him to cling to walls and other surfaces on a verticle plane. Firebrand can also hover and fly for awhile with his wings. Destroy the enemy characters with your firery breath. The game also contains an adventure type story that is unfolded by interacting with characters from an over-head perspective.</desc>
	<path>./Gauntlet II (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Based on the arcade game, Gauntlet II is very similar to the original. Up to four players (a wizard, a warrior, an elf, and a valkyrie) make their way through various mazes, collect treasures and magic potions, and fend off assorted creatures and ghosts.</desc>

	<path>./George Foreman's KO Boxing (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.

Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.

By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.

All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</desc>

	<path>./Ghostbusters II (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Loosely based on the movie of the same name, Ghostbusters II sees Virgo the Carpathian appear in New York city. He captures Diana's baby and it is up to the Ghostbusters to get him back. In order to accomplish this, the Ghostbusters: Igon, Ray, Peter and Winston, must chase Virgo through the courtrooms, the sewers, the apartments, the underground and the art museum.

Ghostbusters II is a top-view action game based off of New Ghostbusters II (the second Ghostbusters II license on NES) but with enough differences to be unique. Players begin by choosing two of the four ghostbusters, who all play the exact same. The first one selected is controlled by the player directly and carries a proton pack, the second ghostbuster is follows the first and carries the ghost trap. The objective of each level is to capture a predefined number of ghosts before the timer expires. The player moves up, down, left and right. One button will fire the proton gun directly in front of the first ghostbuster, stunning any ghosts. The second button will toss the trap directly in front of the second ghostbuster, trapping any stunned ghosts. While exploring the levels, any of the 2 remaining ghostbusters (as well as the ghostbusters' accountant Louis) not currently being used will occasionally show up. Touching them will provide power-ups (and often swap with a selected Ghostbuster) including vacuum guns, instant traps and invulnerability.</desc>
	<path>./Go! Go! Tank (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>A peaceful nation has been invaded by an enemy army, and you must help clear the way for your own forces by plane. You must guide your tank to the end of each stage by arranging boxes with a hook attached to the bottom of your plane, as well as by shooting enemy planes and batteries that threaten it. The tank will roll forward on its own and climb up any wall that is only a single block high -- anything taller and it will crash into it and turn around, taking damage. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed and the game is over. If you get hit, you lose a plane, and if you run out of planes, the game will also be over.

There are several special items to help you on your way, including a power hook that allows you to directly carry the tank, a bomb that can destroy all enemies on the screen, and an option that makes a second plan follow yours and mimic your actions.

The game features ten stages, as well as a 2-player cooperative mode (two planes) when played via link cable.</desc>

Occasionally, when you smash a rock an item will appear. Smashing an item will activate it.
Once all rocks have been smashed two screen exits appear. Choose one of the two and enter the next level.
Keep in mind that in order to reach an exit you have to smash the rocks in a particular order because if you don't you'll get stuck.</desc>

	<path>./Great Greed (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>As Great Greed begins, you are accidentally warped to another dimension by a wizard by the name of Microwave. With no immediate way back, you help the people fight off the scourge named Bio-Haz who is consuming this dimension with evil and destruction.

This new dimension you find yourself in is not terribly unlike the one you came from, with the exception that everyone is named after foods or food-related items and most of the monsters appear to be mutated vegetables and the like.

This RPG breaks from the normal formula in a few respects. The battle system does not use any menus, switching all commands to simple button pushes. A being attack, B for dodge, Start will run and the D-Pad is shortcuts to certain spells. The combat is also live, in the sense that if you take too long to complete your turn, your opponent will attack again.

Using a battery-backed save system, the game will automatically auto-save after every successful battle.</desc>

This episode has Harry fighting more than just workers. He has to defeat an army of ghosts in a series of environments, including construction site, sewer, airship, jungle, and finally, the headquarters where he meets the evil ghost building machine. Rather than using his mallet, Harry can obtain a spiked ball which does more damage than the mallet. There are five stages, and each one ends with Harry fighting a boss. Upon completion of a stage, the gameplay switches from a beat-em-up to a horizontal shooter where Harry flies through the air, defeating airborne enemies and avoiding dangerous objects.

	<path>./Harvest Moon GB (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Harvest Moon is a farming simulator/RPG where you must build and maintain a farm during the course of a year, while taking care of your budget and yourself. 

You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of farm animals, crops and any other supplies that you may have. You can trade with many of the town's people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend's Game Boy, you can trade items between players as well.

The local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work.

From an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods.

The GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version.</desc>

	<desc>In Hatris, the falling blocks of Tetris are replaced by falling hats which are  top hats, cowboy hats, baseball caps, derbys, party hats and crowns. The setting is a hat factory, where hats are dropped down from a conveyor belt two at a time and must be stacked on one of six mannequin heads. Once five hats of the same kind have been stacked on top of each other, they fall down onto another conveyor belt below and are shipped out of the factory, rewarding the player with a cash bonus. (The game keeps track of score as money, not simply points.)  Once you ship out enough hats out of the shop, you go up a level to the next shop. The higher shop number you get to, the more types of hats start appearing to make it more difficult for you to accomplish your task. The game ends when one of your stacks of hats reaches the top of the screen.</desc>

	<path>./Heiankyo Alien (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>1000 years ago the city of Kyo was suddenly invaded by aliens.  A Kebiishi (knight of the past) was entrusted to defend the city.

The game starts with a maze where the kebiishi and some aliens appear. The aliens start moving through the maze wherever they please. While trying to keep from getting eaten, the kebiishi digs holes where the aliens will likely travel. If an alien comes to a finished hole, it will fall in an be trapped for a while. While the alien is trapped in the hole, you can fill the hole to bury it. If all aliens are buried, the round ends and you can proceed to the next round. 

The credits say original concept by TSG, copyright 1979. The Game Boy version includes new original features such as a super alien that has special powers, moves to avoid holes and chases the keibiishi. Two players can play via the video link cable.</desc>

	<desc>Hit the Ice is a fast-paced, high-impact hockey game based on the 1990 arcade game from Williams. Having more in common with Midway's Arch Rivals than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the opposing team's goal, each team only has three players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and it is possible to do a "super shot" which is strong enough to send the goalie into the net along with the puck.

Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a "shot race" mode where the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.</desc>

	<desc>Kevin is left alone at home while his family is celebrating the holidays elsewhere. Unfortunately for him, two burglars have entered the house to keep him company. Kevin must avoid being caught by the burglars while he gathers all the family belongings and bring them to safety. To aid him in his quest, Kevin has a slingshot and a water pistol, but equally important is proper handling of the environment - a banana skid placed in the right spot or a bowling ball on top of a cupboard will help Kevin in his cause against the robbers.</desc>
	<path>./Home Alone 2 - Lost In New York (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Loosely based on the film of the same name, Kevin McAllister has arrived in New York City without his parents. However he checks himself into a hotel and begins to have fun. It isn't long before the hotel  discovers he's using stolen credit cards and begin to chase him around! On top of that, Harry and Marv the burglars he once defeated, are in town and looking for revenge.

Home Alone 2 is a side scroller. Controlling Kevin McAllister, the player will need to jump over enemies and obstacles while collecting items. These items include health bonuses and a variety of weapons. Losing all of Kevin's health or being "caught" will cost a life. The player starts with three lives for play.

	<desc>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.

This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels. These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</desc>

	<desc>Hudson Hawk, a cat burglar, has a mission: steal three of Da Vinci's works of art, which include a rocking horse known as "The Sforza", his sketchbook that he called "The Codex", and a precious crystal. The mission will take him through a mansion, castles, rooftops, subways, and the Vatican. Of course, getting all these items will not be as easy as it sounds. Not only does Hawk face security guards, guard dogs, and others, but he must also avoid setting off alarms. To help him, Hawk can either punch enemies, or throw a ball at them.</desc>

	<desc>Your job in this action puzzler is to help prehistoric man to evolve by helping them discover tools, the wheel, weapons, or even fire. Each level in the game will have a given task to help in this, and you are allotted a number of characters who must accomplish the task. The player can switch from person to person while moving the characters around each scrolling puzzle, and teamwork is essential to success.  

Tasks can include finding objects (like a spear) on the screen, or trying to reach a specific destination which may require the use of objects you have discovered so far. Each level has a time limit, when time runs out the level can be restarted.</desc>

While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. 

You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.</desc>

	<desc>Hyper Lode Runner plays similar to Lode Runner. You must run around on brick platforms gathering all the gold, while avoiding enemies, known as Mad Monks, who follow your every move. You can zap blocks to create temporary holes to trap enemies or to escape through to platforms below. To make levels more interesting there are ladders and vertical ropes to climb, but the enemies can use these too.

There are 50 levels to play, and there is also an editor and a VS mode.</desc>

You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isnt handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.</desc>

There is also a "construction set" where players can create their own tiles and backgrounds. But the game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.

The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.

The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence. Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.</desc>

	<desc>One of many different titles based on Steven Spielberg's 1993 dinosaur thriller, the version for NES and Game Boy is a top-down action game with exploration elements.

Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player must work through six levels by completing certain objectives including rescuing the kids Tim and Lex, restoring power, destroying Raptor nests and finally getting off the dinosaur-infested island. To advance in a level, a number of dinosaur eggs scattered over the area must be collected or destroyed. This will reveal a passcard used to gain entry to buildings, or some other items necessary to complete the assignment. The park's computer terminals can be used to request hints on where to go next.

Naturally, the levels are full of hostile dinosaurs. Dr. Grant can fend them off with his gun. Several ammunition types are available, varying in damage and shooting patterns. Killed dinosaurs will always drop the most basic ammo type, the others must be found. Next to ammo clips, there are boxes with question marks on them to be collected. These might include beneficial powerups like a health increase, but can also be dangerous and reveal a bomb.

Some levels end in boss encounters, including a Triceratops stampede and a fight against the Tyrannosaurus Rex.</desc>

	<desc>In the distant future, a monopolistic and technological corporation called Ultratech organizes a fighting tournament known as "Killer Instinct". Many fighters answer the challenge to participate, including several of Ultratech's experimental warriors.  To increase the tournament's challenge, Ultratech utilizes a technology that can create bridges between alternate dimensions, releasing a creature known as Eyedol.  Eyedol is a two-headed ancient warrior that was imprisoned along with his bitter rival, Gargos. Some warriors enter the tournament to seek glory or escape.  Other fighters are attempting to bring an end to Ultratech's corruption.  

Killer Instinct is a Rare developed fighting game published by Nintendo (and distributed in the arcades by Midway). Killer Instinct (or "KI" among its fanbase) is a 2D fighting game that features 3D rendered sprite based graphics. Players choose from 10 characters: Orchid, Cinder, Jago, Glacius, Fulgore, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal, T.J. Combo, and Thunder.

Once again, fighters from all over the world receive a mysterious invitation to a team-based fighting tournament. And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again...

The King of Fighters '95 introduces Kyo Kusanagi's rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series. The gameplay of The King of Fighters '95 is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the "team edit" concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the "team edit" feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish.</desc>

The playing field contains a variety of blocks, and using Kirby's rolling technique, you must set him into motion (with paddles situated around the field of play, similar to pinball) to clear the blocks from the field. Each level contains more and more blocks to clear, and after a few rounds you take on boss characters in a one-on-one round to see if you can clear more blocks.</desc>

	<desc>Kirby is a an interesting little super-hero.  Although he appears to be a weak little marshmallow, he is actually quite powerful.  He has the ability to suck up his enemies like a vacuum, and then shoot them out at other enemies.  Kirby can also swallow air, allowing him to fly through the air.

In this game, Kirby must save his land from the evil King Dedede. There are 4 levels of side-scrolling platform action.</desc>
	<path>./Kirby's Dream Land 2 (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Blurb:  Nintendo's/Hal Laboratory's lovable Kirby returns for the gameboy! This time the bridges connecting the rainbow bridges have dissapeared and King DeDeDe is to blame as always...or is he? The evil Dark Matter has him under his control and plans to turn Kirby's Dream Land into a dark world, get the fabled rainbow sword and defeat him!

Gameplay consists of a platform game. Kirby is like no other platform character of it's time because he can fly with no power-ups, and he can swallow enemies and get their powers. In addition to that, Kirby can now team up with his friends: Rick the hamster, Kine the fish, and Coo the owl. Each team-up has it's advantages and disadvantages, but Kirby can still swallow enemies, making more different powers available depending on the power/friend combination.</desc>
	<path>./Kirby's Pinball Land (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Kirby's Pinball Land is a game of pinball based on the Kirby series of games, with Kirby as the ball.  In the game you have to help Kirby defeat King Dedede and the three bosses who each guard one of the Pinball Lands.  

The game is divided into three tables or Pinball Lands, each consisting of four screens, three ordinary screens, and a boss screen If you fall off the bottom of the lowest one, you lose a life, unless you press A at the right moment to activate the springboard, which becomes harder each time. Each screen has a variety of things to do. The middle screen will give access to some sort of bonus game, where you must try to get as many points as you can, and can add to your bonus and bonus multiplier. The bonus is added to your score when you lose a life, as in ordinary pinball.

The aim is to defeat each boss. To get to the boss you must perform a task on the top ordinary screen. The bosses themselves must be defeated by firing Kirby at them, but they will try to stop you, sometimes by temporarily de-activating one or both of the flippers. If you defeat the boss on each table, you face Kind Dedede himself.</desc>
	<path>./Kirby's Star Stacker (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Kirby's Star Stacker is a Tetris-like puzzle game.  There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically.  The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play.  Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types:

Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared. The more stars you clear, the higher the score.

Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen. Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.

Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row. 

Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way.

The game also features a clever 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks. If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further!</desc>

	<desc>You take control of a young man named Will who wants to become a knight. After successfully completing his first quest for the king, he is allowed to serve him as a knight and take on more quests in which he has to free the land of evil monsters and wizards.

Knight Quest is a single-person RPG with turn-based battles. You can explore the land from a top-down perspective, enter houses, inns and shops to rest, buy equipment or receive information on your current quest. Enemies are visible and whenever you walk into one, you are taken to a battle mode that is seen from a side-view perspective. In battles, you have the option to attack, cast spells, use medicine or escape. There are for different types of attacks called "Swallow", "Sea Gull", "Falcon" and "Eagle", that deal different amounts of damage to different enemies.</desc>

	<desc>Krusty the Clown's Fun House has been overrun by rats.  You must help him to herd the rats into trap machines to clear them out.  In order to do so, Krusty must manipulate his environment to set up pathways so that the rats are headed in the right direction.  Objects that Krusty move around include blocks, fans, and pipe pieces.

The trap machines are operated by other recognizable Simpson's characters: Bart, Homer, Sideshow Mel, and Corporal Punishment.</desc>

	<desc>Similar to Kung-Fu Master games for other platforms but with different levels, it is your job to fight your way through hordes of bad guys and ultimately kill the super-villain. To do this, you can use three different moves: a punch, a kick and a somersault. Sometimes you can also pick up bombs that deal a larger amount of damage. Apart from fighting the bad guys, there are also a few levels that feature Jump'N Run elements. At the end of each stage, there is, of course, a boss waiting to be beaten up.</desc>

The game, based on the film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is very different for each platform. For most of them, the gameplay can be split up into two parts: side-scrolling fighting levels and wild car chases on the streets.</desc>
	<path>./Lawnmower Man, The (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. 

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</desc>

	<desc>This unique RPG provides a world of fishing as the prime objective.

There are two modes of play, The Fish and Raise.

The Fish: As a young boy, you must search out the fish called Guardian, the only fish in the river that can cure a disease caught by your sister, Teruyo. This mode combines RPG elements such as buying items, talking to the town's folk and searching the local river for the Guardian fish. The fishing element comes into play when you bait or lure fish at the river, in hopes to find a fish.

Raise mode allows you to purchase a fish tank and the extras, and raise a small fish. Much like the many Pokémon type games, you can feed it, keep the tank clean and raise the fish.</desc>
	<path>./Legend of Zelda, The - Link's Awakening (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>The fourth game in the Zelda series although it does not take place in Hyrule. After being attacked at sea, Link's ship sinks, and he finds himself stranded on Koholint Island. He awakens to see a beautiful woman looking down at him. He soon learns the island has a giant egg on top of a mountain that the Wind Fish inhabits deep inside. Link is told to "awaken the wind fish and all will be answered," so Link sets out on another quest.

Play is similar to the SNES game with a top down perspective. Link must go onto each of the 7 temples to retrieve a musical instrument that will help awaken the Wind Fish. Along the way, Link must search the land and uncover hidden treasures and items that will allow him to progress on his journey. With new items, he can open up new passages that will take him even farther on his quest and allow him to enter new areas that were inaccessible before. Link can attack his enemies with his sword or use items he finds during his quest to help him. Guarding every instrument is a temple boss, which must be defeated if Link is to awaken the Wind Fish.

	<path>./Lemmings (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 levels of fast-paced puzzling. These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</desc>
	<path>./Lemmings 2 - The Tribes (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant plot. The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.

Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players. 

The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment.

Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. 

Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.

Firstly, you have to stop drug dealers who want to transport their money from the dock, where you infiltrate. Secondly, you have to stop suicidal terrorists, who entered the subway. Thirdly, you have to defuse a bomb, planted by another terrorist group in the mall. Fourthly, you have to sneak into an office complex to free a hostage, Leo Getz.

When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &amp;quot;roar meter&amp;quot; to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</desc>

Coyote) and finally Bugs Bunny (gameplay similar to Daffy).</desc>
	<path>./Loopz (World).zip</path>
	<desc>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.

Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.

Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. 

Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.

The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.</desc>
	<path>./Lost World, The - Jurassic Park (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>The handheld game based on the second Jurassic Park movie puts the player in the shoes of an agent of InGen corporation who is sent to Isla Sorna, also known as "Site B", where dinosaurs still roam freely.

In each of the eight levels, a number of items (dinosaur eggs, computer disks or DNA samples) must be collected to finish the level. Gameplay mostly consists of running, jumping and climbing through the large platform-like levels. However, in the jungles and caves of the island, many enemies await: Both various dinosaur species, including Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptor, and human enemies, employees of InGen's rival BioSyn. The player can defend himself by using kicks and punches, a pistol or a grenade launcher. Ammo and health power-ups can be found in boxes scattered around the levels.

	<path>./Lucky Luke (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>You play as Lucky Luke, lonesome cowboy, who draws his gun faster than his shadow.  In a received telegram you read that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Pat Poker, and The Dalton Brothers have escaped from jail. You as a good cowboy and law keeper have to catch them and return them back, finishing 12 levels of the game.

Players guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking. There are also objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful items. You also have to use collected items to get past a certain obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull, feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions. Shooting exhausts the six bullets in your gun's barrel. To kill the bandits, bad Indians, prisoners, you should shoot at them for a certain number of times.

Locations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, and at the end of the final level you should challenge four Daltons one after another again.

Some levels are scrolling arcades such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo, or flowing in the rapids. Also the bonus level is present, where you should shoot all the bottles to get and extra life.</desc>

The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</desc>
	<path>./Mario's Picross (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Nonograms are number puzzles where logic is used to find the solution. Clues are provided along the sides of the playfield grid, telling the player how many squares to fill in each row and column. With logic the player can figure out exactly which squares of the grid to fill. The thinking process is similar to solving Sudoku puzzles.

Mario's Picross (from PICture CROSSword) is Nintendo's take on Nonograms. In this game, Mario takes on the role of an archaeologist who chisels away the squares in each playfield. The result is a small picture. There are 256 different puzzles to solve, divided into four courses with increasing difficulty level.</desc>

	<desc>Mega Man is the robot creation of Dr. Light, whose sworn archenemy Dr. Wily spends innumerable games trying to cause trouble with his own odd robots. As Mega Man, you run and jump through futuristic levels, shooting baddies with your blaster, and defeat each of Dr. Wily's Robot Masters. When you defeat them, you can take their ability as your own, which can provide an advantage against other types of evil robots.

In this Game Boy version, Mega Man must fight against Ice Man, Electric Man, Cut Man, and Fire Man. After he defeats those four he battles Quick Man, Heat Man, Bubble Man, and Flash Man. And after that, there's Dr. Wily's Space Node. That sounds like a lot, but passwords will save your progress, if you make it past certain milestones.

	<path>./Mega Man II (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Dr. Wily has broken into the Chronos Institute and stolen a machine called Time Skimmer. According to Dr. Light's calculations, he has used the machine to travel roughly 37,426 years into the future. This can mean nothing good and so Mega Man, along with his dog Rush, sets out to find out more about Dr. Wily's plans.

Mega Man II follows the same formula as its predecessors, meaning the player has to complete a number of side-scrolling, platforming levels that are guarded by different bosses. Mega Man can only shoot left or right, but defeating a boss rewards him with a new weapon. Sometimes he will also find upgrades for Rush, which enable him to use Rush as a trampoline, a submarine or a jet.

While Mega Man II is not a conversion, the first four stages look and play very similar to some levels of Mega Man 2 for the NES. Likewise, levels five to eight resemble some levels of Mega Man 3. The bosses of the first eight stages are also old familiars from Mega Man 2 and 3.</desc>

	<desc>Dr. Wily is at it again!  This time, he's set up an oil rig in the middle of the ocean and is drilling deep down to the earth's magma core.  The reason?  He plans to use the incredible power generated to fuel his latest diabolical robot creation!  Of course, only Mega Man can stop him!

Mega Man III follows the tradition of the previous Game Boy games - you must run, jump and blast your way through four boss worlds. After defeating the four bosses, you will encounter an intermission level. Once this level is beaten, you face four more bosses, then move on to the final showdown with Dr. Wily. This is the first Game Boy Mega Man title to introduce the Mega Buster from Mega Man 4 for the NES. If you hold down the B Button, you'll be able to charge up your cannon for a more powerful shot.

Mega Man III combines Snake Man, Gemini Man, Shadow Man and Spark Man from Mega Man 3 as well as Dust Man, Skull Man, Dive Man and Drill Man from Mega Man 4. In addition to this, there is a powerful Game Boy exclusive boss called Punk, who uses screw-like weapons to attack.</desc>

One peaceful day, Mega Man and his sister Roll are enjoying a quiet stroll through a meadow when they are suddenly attacked by a robot named Terra, who says that he and his soldiers, the StarDroids, are going to conquer the Earth! Mega Man attempts to fight off this new foe, but is quickly beaten by the StarDroid's far superior firepower.

Later, Mega Man awakens to find Dr. Light standing over him, telling him that the StarDroids have almost taken over the world. But thankfully he was quickly able to examine both their firepower and their structures, and was able to modify Mega Man's weapon system into something much more powerful. Mega Man tries this new weapon, and finds that he can now fire his whole fist! Dr. Light dubs this new weapon the "Mega Arm"!

Now, armed with the Mega Arm, and a new companion, the robotic cat Tango, Mega Man must destroy the StarDroids and save the planet while he can! The ultimate battle for the Earth begins!</desc>

All who challenged the wicked Lord were mercilessly slain as a warning to all those who had any further thoughts of rebellion. Then one day while meditating, the great Shogun, Tokugawa, had a divine vision where he saw a small group of mighty warriors rise up to defeat the evil Lord.

While on his way to deliver a very special gift to his girlfriend Minnie, Mickey is jumped by Pete who steals the present and takes off and it is up to the mouse duo to stop Pete and get back the present.

The gameplay is a side-scroller, where players pick up boxes to throw at enemies as well as discover power-ups that include short bursts of invincibility, extra lives and energy boosts that will help the player in their quest. There are five different levels to play in including a lake, a mountain top, a forest and a shopping center and numerous enemies to avoid such as spiders, flying squirrels and even snowballs.</desc>
	<path>./Mickey's Ultimate Challenge (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.

Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</desc>

The core of the game is a side-scrolling fighter similar to Streets of Rage with basic controls for each Ranger (one button punches, one jumps while both buttons combined kicks) and unique weapons for each individual ranger.

Before a level the player can choose which Ranger they want to use and as they progress through each level, not only do they have to fight off bad guys and end level bosses, they also have avoid various obstacles like pits and falling rocks. There is also a bonus level at the end of each and if they player can do well enough, they can extend their life bar.</desc>

Snatch all of Jinbei's cabbages in every level, and if you get stuck, dig underground and create your own secret underground paths.  A word of warning, however - Jinbei has got his best goons guarding your family, so you'd better watch out!

Mole Mania plays from an overhead perspective. Although in each room you have to destroy all the foes to progress, the game is much more puzzle-oriented than it is towards action. It is quite common in later levels to get yourself 'stuck', which can be fixed by leaving and returning to the screen to reset the puzzle. One of the game's clever 'hooks' is that players can dig underground in each stage to find a completely different map than they do above ground, which can be used to get through otherwise impassable terrain.

The game also features a two player mode, where one player is Muddy, and the other is Jinbei. Muddy must swipe as many cabbages as possible, and Jinbei must stop him. At the end of the round, players swap roles, and then the player who got the most cabbages wins.</desc>

	<desc>A powerful human called Krond conquers the Monster Planet, bans all music and declares himself king. Max, a monster rock musician decides to fight back. In order to defeat the evil monarch, he enlists in the training course at the Mega Hero Academy.

Monster Max is a surreal isometric adventure by the same duo that created the 8-bit classic Head Over Heels. Not surprisingly it is very similar to that game in terms of control and general design, and almost identical graphically. The character moves on a bizarre landscape, where he has to collect and use objects (with either the A or B button) to accomplish mission objectives. The game starts on a training academy that serves as the mission hub. Each mission has as an entrance with a terminal and a door. By touching the terminal with the character, the mission objective and reward is displayed on the screen. The missions available can be played in any order, but Max has to pay a fee to access other levels with more advanced missions. On the top left of the screen there is a counter for the lucky stars collected. Lucky stars allow the character to touch dangerous objects once without suffering damage. Besides that are several hearts representing the number of lives. On the top right is the inventory display, showing the two objects assigned to the buttons. Hitting START while on a mission brings up a map, while pressing SELECT displays a menu with options and the password at the bottom of the screen.

The game is far larger than previous isometric adventures like Knight Lore, with over 600 more detailed locations (the double of Head Over Heels). There is a password system to save progress.</desc>

	<desc>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</desc>

	<desc>Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.

A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.

Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, "Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.

Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</desc>

There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.

To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player.

As Mr. Chin, you can drop bowls on the ground with the B Button.  If you place one bowl on the left and one on the right, a laser will fire between the two bowls, and any enemies will be caught between, transforming into peaches.  Mr. Chin can then gobble up the peaches - if he grabs more in a row, their value increases (Mr. Chin's score is measured in calories).  When Mr. Chin eats all the enemies on-screen, more quickly take their place.  Gobble them all up, and when there are no more enemies in the level, you can progress to the next one.

Enemies in the levels can walk on thin line paths, but Mr. Chin will fall through these - he can only walk on bricks. Mr. Chin can also smash the bricks by punching them from underneath - sometimes this will reveal a power up, such as invincibility and the ability to turn all foes into peaches instantly.</desc>

Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

	<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is an overhead Action RPG similar to Link's Awakening. Players explore towns, dungeons, castles and more, searching for treasure chests and attacking enemies. There are also shops and inns where you can purchase items or rest to recover your strength.

As the game progresses, levels get more and more complicated and new types of nails,such as explosive nails that remove particularly resilient blocks, become available.</desc>

At the beginning and end of each level, there is a cut scene which consists of a still image with text, to progress the story of the game.

You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons as the game goes on. The gameplay is fairly standard platform work, seen in many other Ocean movie tie-ins.

The Game Boy version of this game differs from the home computer version released around the same time. The level layout is different, there are no ladders ladders or ropes and you don't have to place bombs. This is possibly due to technical or game pack memory limitations of the Game Boy.</desc>

	<desc>Timing smiled on Gremlin with this licensed Formula 1 simulation, as Nigel's long quest for a championship had finally come good. The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.

Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices  pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.</desc>

	<path>./Ninja Gaiden Shadow (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Ninja Gaiden Shadow is a prequel to Ninja Gaiden. It is 1985, 3 years before the events of the NES game, and Jaquio has not yet been awakened. However, Emperor Garuda, an evil dictator, threatens New York city and it is up to the Ryu Hayabusa to fight him.

This game is an action side-scroller. Ryu can run, jump and beat his enemies using a sword. He also has a grappling-hook device, which can be used to reach higher platforms, which can then be hand-climbed across. By collecting power ups Ryu can use a magical technique called "the art of the fire wheel", an ascending and spinning wheel of fire which will take more damage than his usual sword. He has up to 5 charges of this technique. Ryu has a life meter with six units, which can be replenished by finding proper power ups inside containers.

The game is divided in 5 stages. Each stages has sub-screens, and the main objective is to go from left to right till the end of the screen, destroying the enemies in the way. Among the enemies Ryu will find humans, cyborgs and machines. At the end of each stage a boss fight awaits Ryu.</desc>

	<desc>This soccer game was made at the time when Nintendo introduced their four player adapter, and was probably made for the four playing purpose. This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or more players. Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the replayability.

When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.

In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.</desc>
	<path>./Nobunaga's Ambition (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. 

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.

During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp;amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.</desc>

	<path>./Olympic Summer Games (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.

Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. 

Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.

The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.

Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</desc>
	<path>./Operation C (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Operation C is a Game Boy sequel to the popular NES titles Contra and Super C and is, essentially, a side-scrolling shooter. You play a Rambo-esque character that goes around shooting everything in sight, collecting weapon upgrades and bonuses.

The game introduces the character of Black Viper to the series' oft-jumbled continuity. Black Viper would later return in the Nintendo DS title, Contra 4, as the primary villain. 

The game features only five levels, two of which are played from an overhead perspective similar to Super C. Operation C is also notable in featuring the upgradable Spread Gun (from three to five shots) and introducing the Hunter Gun. 

There is also the occasional platform element such as jumping puzzles, moving platforms etc., and the mandatory end-level boss.</desc>

The gameplay is not very far from Asteroids, where you are the pilot of a ship and must complete level after level. For each level your objective is to get gas by shoot a the G-signs scattered around the levels. In some levels you have to shooting the signs in a special order. The levels must be completed in time, and you also have to watch out for enemy fire.</desc>
	<path>./Pac-Attack (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.

Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.

The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.

All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</desc>
	<path>./Pac-In-Time (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Everybody knows what/who Pac-Man is from his heyday in the '80s, but this time, we're getting a whole new adventure of our little eater. Guess his stomach is full, 'cause there's nothing much to eat here, only collecting points. This is much like some Indiana Jones adventure, only your little hero's Pac-Man instead of Harrison Ford.

Pac-in-time is the US release of Fury of the Furries. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed: the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek/Super Skweek/Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man.</desc>
	<path>./Pac-Man (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

	<desc>The Pagemaster was released in conjunction with the Macaulay Culkin part action/part cartoon feature film released in 1994. Guide your character through a selection of levels based around themed books, ranging from Horror to Adventure and Fantasy worlds. You can use magic and stomp enemies to death by jumping on their head. Enemies include bats, flying books, giant hands, ghosts, pirates and many more.</desc>
	<path>./Palamedes (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>The goal of Palamedes is to clear the screen which is, line by line, filling up with dice. Players control a small person situated near the bottom of the screen, who can only be moved to the left or right. The number of the dice the person is holding can be changed with the B button, pressing the A button will shoot the dice upwards. If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once.

There are three modes of play: The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</desc>

	<desc>This is mostly the parody of Gradius (Nemesis on some systems), with some flavor from other shoot-em-ups, like Twinbee. The series is available on numerous platforms.

The game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage.</desc>

	<desc>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</desc>

	<path>./Pipe Dream (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

Players select one of three fighters (Buzz, Ty or Kato) to take on anyone who dares. At the conclusion of a match, players are individually awarded a Knockout Bonus, Brutality Bonus, and a Fight Purse. Every third match is a Grudge Match where players test the skills of each other. The last man standing is the winner of this three-knockdown match.

Using the punch attack the player can destroy bricks. When destroyed, some bricks will reveal spinach which can be collected. The number of collected spinach determines the size of Popeyes fist. When Popeye is hit by an enemy the size of his fist decreases again. The player can collect a maximum of seven cans of spinach at which point the player gains a ranged attack where it shoots spinach cans. When the player loses all spinach he dies. Each series of levels is concluded with a level boss.</desc>

TwinBee Da!! Puts you behind the controls of two experimental TwinBee fighters as you attempt to rescue Dr. Cinnamon from evil alien forces. In order to do that you must journey through 6 different planets filled with cute and surreal creatures bent on your destruction.

The game uses the classic gameplay mechanics for the genre, with you controlling your craft as the background scrolls vertically towards the end of the stage and trying to survive and destroy all enemies with your laser shots. Twinbee features a selectable power-up system in which you must shoot the bell power-ups to select which type of upgrade you want depending on the color they take (or in this case, the shade of grey).

Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

	<path>./Q Billion (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Q Billion, you play a mouse which must level out a playfield filled with stacks of tiles. To do this, the mouse must climb onto one stack and push a taller, neighbouring stack so that tiles fall off, until there are no tiles stacked on top of each other. Oftentimes, there stacks are not adjacent to each other, which forces the mouse to push a tile next to the stack in order to have something to stand on. Since the mouse is so weak, it can only move a single tile. This calls for a lot of juggling, since in order to move a stack of three tiles (represented by a 3 in a square), it must move a single tile next to a stack of two tiles, then move another tile to the other side of the small stack and push the uppermost tile of the stack onto the single tile in order to create a stack of two next to the stack of three. If there is a distance greater than one or two squares between the stacks, it makes the task daunting and requires a lot of planning, which puts this game straight into the old style of Japanese puzzles pioneered by Sokoban.

Later stages introduce tiles of different kinds, symbolised by hearts, squares or stars. These tiles will, when moved together in groups of four, be eliminated; or at least the uppermost layer will. This calls for three-dimensional  or even four-dimensional  thinking on behalf of the player. None of the special tiles must be left on the screen for the stage to be cleared.

A second gaming mode contains ready-made puzzles which must be solved in a limited amount of time. An editing mode will also allow the player to create levels of his own.</desc>
	<path>./Q-bert for Game Boy (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you guide a marker which must draw rectangles and other weird objects in order to claim your territory, and you can either draw these rectangles fast or slow. Drawing the rectangles using the "slow" method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced "kicks"), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing. Once you have claimed enough territory, you proceed to the next level.</desc>

	<desc>Quarth is a typical puzzle/arcade game. Quarth can be moved  from right to left while the screen scrolls down. The playing field is filled with different blocks and your aim is to fill them in so they form complete rectangles or squares. Only when you succeed in this mission, the concerned blocks will disappear. New 'unformed' blocks appear while the playing field scrolls down making you play into full action at all times.

	<path>./Race Days (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Race Days lets the player participate in two different types of racing all on one cartridge, Dirty Racing and 4 Wheel Drive.

Dirty Racing is an overhead view with Grand Prix-style cars similar to Micro Machines on a series of courses while avoiding obstacles and taking out opponents.

4 Wheel Drive is a behind-the-wheel perspective, similar to NASCAR Fast Tracks in a series of off-road courses complete with hills, bumps and sharp curves while trying to overtake opponents. The player is also warned of any upcoming sharp turns by arrows at the top of their windshield.

Two friends can also compete against each other using the GameLink cable.</desc>
	<path>./Race Drivin' (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Race Drivin' is a sequel to the arcade driving simulator Hard Drivin'. Game play is similar to the first game. The player must complete laps around the race track before a  timer expires. There are several checkpoints around the track which increase player's time as he passes. 

Race Drivin' has three courses, one of which is the track from Hard Drivin'. There is a new super-stunt track, and an autocross course. The player also may choose from three types of cars.</desc>
	<path>./Radar Mission (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Radar Mission is mostly a Battleship board game clone with two game modes. The first is very recognizable, with a map to select and place the ships. Then the game is played by picking squares (e.g. A5). There are several different ships, ranging from the five-hit aircraft carriers to the two hit cruisers, even a fighter jet in later levels.

The second mode is more of a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a submarine, trying to destroy the enemy fleet before they take the player's vessel out. Either the player takes out all the battleships causing the enemy submarine to surrender or he directly destroys the submarine to end the level. When submerged a radar view appears, showing the player's ships along with the enemies, providing a strategic intermission to plot out the attack.</desc>

	<desc>Tetris meets shoot-'em-up, Rampart was originally a one or two-player arcade game combining strategy and artillery action. Build your castle from Tetris-style pieces, place your cannons, bombard the enemy, try to repair, do it all over again. Later arcade revisions incorporated 3-player,  and the PC conversion does as well, making it a faithful, entertaining classic for multiple players on the same PC.</desc>
	<path>./Real Ghostbusters, The (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The Real Ghostbusters, known as Garfield Labyrinth in Europe and Mickey Mouse IV: Mahou no Labyrinth in Japan, is a puzzle/platform game. The story is very simple: Venkman (or Garfield and Odie or Mickey and Mini Mouse, depending on the version you play) walk over a bridge one day, a tile breaks loose and Venkman/Garfield/Mickey falls down a deep pit, which ends up in a bizarre labyrinth, which Venkman/Garfield/Mickey must escape. There's no other goal apart from that, the player just needs to find the exit in each level. Apart from getting there, the exit must also be unlocked. For the latter, the player must collect all gems in the level.

Each level contains various traps and enemies which need to be avoided. The puzzles involve finding keys to lower bridges or open doors, make use of teleporters and especially: drilling away blocks. Conveniently, the player finds a pneumatic hammer at the beginning of the game, which must be used to create paths to certain areas and items, without blocking the way forth or back. There's also an inventory to store items like keys and bombs (used to kill enemies). The protagonist has a health bar and can take several hits before losing a life, but there is also a time limit for each level.

The game features a password system, a password is given automatically after completing a level.

In spite of the differences in main character and a minor variation in the short intro cinematic all regional versions are identical.</desc>

	<desc>Riddick Bowe Boxing is another one of the many boxing games released at the time, but with subtle differences. The HUD contains damage and energy meters along with a miniature ring up the top of the screen, useful to see the player's position in the ring so as not to get backed into a corner real easily.

Players can compete in the standard, 1-Player v. CPU, 1-Player v. 2-Player or even a career mode, where there are four preset fighters to choose from along with an option to create customers boxers. The career starts out at position #25 in the ranking and players slowly work up the ladder, going to the gym in between bouts to build up stats to eventually take on "Big Daddy" himself, Riddick Bowe.

The game is practically a copy of Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, save for the graphics style and the included fighters.</desc>
	<path>./Ring Rage (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Ring Rage is a standard wrestling game, just without the glitz and glamour of licensed games. There are six wrestlers total, but only five are playable:

1. Gunboat Rody, a former Navy sailor
2. Spike, a giant of a man from the means streets of New York
3. Yasha, a masked Japanese wrestler
4. Shadam, a Middle Eastern grappler
5. KO Joe, a former boxer now trying his hand at professional wrestling.

Killer Cane, an unknown wrestler from Canada is faced in the championship bout of the tournament, but he is not a playable character.

There are only three modes, 1P v. CPU, 1P v. 2P (which is achieved through a cable link and an extra cartridge) and a tournament which you compete to go for the TWF (Taito Wrestling Federation) championship.</desc>
	<path>./Road Rash (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</desc>

The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

	<path>./RoboCop vs. The Terminator (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The crossover of the two 80s Action/Sci-Fi franchises comes to the Game Boy in this platform title, based very loosely on a Dark Horse comic.

The player controls RoboCop, who, while taking care of law &amp; order in Detroit, discovers some unusual troublemakers: Terminators sent from the future. To deal with the threat, Robo will have to make his way through an OCP factory and computer complex, where a time machine awaits that will take him to the post-nuclear wasteland of future Los Angeles. There, he must destroy the Skynet mainframe to free humanity from the machines once and for all.

The game is a platforming affair. RoboCop must destroy various enemies while looking for the level exit, from various criminals in Detroit to advanced robotic probes, Terminators and flying Hunter Killers in in the OCP labs and the future. He is armed with a simple gun which can be upgraded once to a three-directional scatter shot. A single hit means the gun upgrade is lost, though. Life energy can be refilled through power-ups, and extra lives are also available.</desc>

When the king many years later was released he immediately unleashed legions of regenerating monsters on the citizens of the land. Now a hero (or two if you play it in multiplayer) is needed to defeat him and his minions.

The game is an action based RPG played with an isometric perspective. As you battle your way through enemy territory you have two weapons, the sword that you start the game with and a Fire Wand that throws fireballs. You will also find some items to use, i.e. a magic axe that can be used to clear blocked passages, chamelon's ring that makes you part of the terrain and shield to help in defense.</desc>

	<path>./R-Type (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>
	<path>./R-Type II (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>The second R-Type brings more of the same shoot-em up action.
Gameplay is identical to the previous R-Type, except you now have two new weapons.

There are six levels, with themes similar to the previous game. Notable parts include an underwater battle in level 2, and a giant Bydo fleet in level 3.

The Game Boy version of R-Type 2 is missing 1 level and both of the new weapons from the original arcade game.</desc>

In the game Tommy Pickles' little brother (Dil) has vanished without a trace and it is up to the Rugrats to find a replacement baby for Dil Pickles.

The game features eight levels including Pickles house, the hospital, woods, and ancient ruins. There are two levels in which you drive the Reptar Wagon in a top-down perspective, but the rest features standard side-scrolling platform gameplay. In each level the player has to collect specific items and get to the exit before time runs out.</desc>

	<path>./Shanghai (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Shanghai is a tile-based game based on the ancient Chinese game of Mah-Jong.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the center. A tile can only be removed if it is open on at least one side.

This version of Shanghai was licensed from Activision by Hal Laboratory for release on the Game Boy. Unlike the Shanghai series published under Activision, this port contains only a single game layout, that of the standard setup sometimes referred to as "The Turtle" or "The Pyramid."

The game features two options for the visual style of the facecards, either in small designs or in simple letters or numbers. The former is more decorative, but the latter is easier to read. There are also three options for background music that may be selected under a menu by pressing the Select button. Like other versions of Shanghai, there is also a hint mode for when players get stuck.</desc>

After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!</desc>

The side-scrolling levels play similar to other Jump'N Runs, as you have to avoid obstacles and kill enemies by jumping on them. However, since you are on a skateboard, speed plays an important role, meaning that you cannot immediately stop and sometimes need to drive at full speed to manage wider jumps. The top-down levels play more similar to other Skate Or Die games as gradients influence your driving while you are trying to avoid obstacles, enemies and deadly spikes.

So you as male Smurf or female Smurfette should travel from one continent to another. The continents represent North Pole, Africa, Asia, North America, South America, and Australia, and each of them consists of 3 levels. On each level character should collect certain number of crystal shards, which in sum gives 21 crystal shards. During the level character should collect other items to raise a score, avoid or eliminate the enemies specific for each area jumping over them, swim somewhere, or run away from cougar.

Also ride storks, mine carts and logs to defeat Gargamel and his minions and to rescue the missing smurfs. 

On each level you must collect five stars in order to get access to the bonus level. (You don't have to collect the five stars in order to get through the main level) On the bonus level, try to collect as many bonuses as possible before the time runs out. There are three bonus levels: "The Dam", "The Mushrooms" and "The Butterflies".</desc>

	<desc>When Sonia Snake is kidnapped by the Nasty Nibbler, only two snakes can save her!  It's up to Attila and Genghis to eat their way through sixteen tricky stages as they avoid nasty traps and open the exits by standing on the scales to open the exit door.

Sneaky Snakes is a pseudo-sequel to the NES game Snake, Rattle 'n Roll. However, instead of an isometric playfield, the game is this time a standard sidescrolling platformer. Players can play as Attila (or link up and play simultaneously with a friend as Genghis) through various devious levels. The goal of each level is to eat enough Nibbleys (round creatures which come in assorted flavors including balloons, jellyfish, joggers, and more) to earn enough tail segments. When your snake has enough segments, its body will flash, and you can weigh yourself to open the exit gate and progress to the next level.

Each level has a time limit of 99 seconds - if this runs out, a giant ax will appear, chasing after your snake until it eventually destroys it. To prevent this from occurring, you can collect clocks which add another 30 seconds to your time limit. You can also collect power ups such as increased jump height, tongue extensions, and diamonds which briefly make you invincible.</desc>

You can create or remove blocks to your left and right, or while crouching lower-left and lower right. You can use these blocks as platform to climb onto, or use them to block enemies or fire balls. You can also break blocks by jumping from below them, like doing a headbutt. There are several enemies, such as fire breathing dragons, shooting gargoyles and ghosts.

	<desc>Spanky, a cute little monkey, is locked in a tower filled with equally cute baddies. He must get to the top of four different towers, which can be chosen between when beginning the game. When the four towers have been climbed, the fifth tower remains.

To get through the door and on to the next floor in the towers, Spanky must collect keys, which are sometimes held by the baddies. To aid him, he has a magic ball. Throwing the ball will stun the baddies for a short while, but not defeat them. However, by bouncing the ball it will grow in size, and depending on its size, it will explode in different patterns, and the shrapnel will kill off the baddies, clearing the way and releasing keys.

Published by in Europe by Taito, Spanky fit straight into the company's portfolio of puzzle arcade platformers in the Bubble Bobble vein. The game also exists for the SNES, but the level layouts differ, as well as the fact that one cannot choose freely between the towers.</desc>

The player can run in the side-scrolling levels. The aim is to reach the exit without running out of lives. Lives are lost when Speedy comes into contact with dangers such as enemies, pit traps and sharp spikes.

Speedy can earn points by collecting coins. The game also borrows elements from Sonic. Speedy can run faster and even upside down in loops after running into bumpers. Speedy can also jump higher by jumping on the heads of penguins and when going fast can run through certain walls.</desc>

Gameplay this time around is slightly deeper than the previous title.

So, they steal the weapon and break it up into 12 pieces spread out over 3 planets.

It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to travel to the 3 planets, recover all 12 pieces of the weapon, and finally stop the Doomsday Machine. There are two modes of game play. First, there is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which you pilot the Enterprise through asteroid fields and enemy fleets. Second, there is a overhead-view game in which you maneuver Captain Kirk around the planet to gather up the pieces of the weapon.

Players will start on the main screen of the bridge and from there can access Navigation, Tactical, Operations, Engineering, Transporter Systems and Mission Control. Mini-games are sometimes used to complete certain ship functions (such as rerouting power to the shields).

	<desc>Based on the movie, so the storyline is basically the same. You play as Luke Skywalker, and using your blaster, lightsaber and force power skills, you must journey through Hoth, Echo Base, Dagobah, Bespin and Cloud City. Enemies such as Darth Vader and Boba Fett will appear along the way, while R2, Yoda and Obi-Wan appear to give you tips on enemy weakness. Also keep and eye out for things you won't see in the movie, such as trying to beat Slave 1 (Boba Fett's ship) and fighting Cloud Cars.

	<path>./Star Wars (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>This game is based closely on Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.  It combines a number of gameplay styles, but primarily it is a side scrolling run-and-jump platformer.

The game begins on Tatooine, where you, as Luke Skywalker, must travel around and meet up with R2D2, C3PO, Obi-Wan, and so on. Eventually, you travel through Mos Eisley and the Death Star as well. While most of the game has you controlling Luke, Han or Leia directly, some of the various game styles include a first-person Millennium Falcon asteroid belt sequence, and an overhead view Death Star trench run.</desc>
	<path>./Stargate (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D  Tetris. Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate "address" along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.

There are two game modes building on this basic concept:

1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.

Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.</desc>
	<path>./Stop That Roach! (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Stop that Roach! is a turn-based strategy game where the player has to eliminate a number of cockroaches on each level. 

The player has five turns in which he can move of a certain amount of tiles, place traps, stomp to frighten the cockroaches, step on them, hit them with a broom or spray them with an insecticide. Next come the cockroaches' turn, their actions being defined by precise rules. 

If the insects can escape or reach the piece of food you're meant to protect, you lose the round. Victory is achieved if all cockroaches are either destroyed or captured.

The game includes a detailed tutorial with explanations of all the game mechanics.</desc>

	<desc>Before the flashy graphics, 3D animation and 30 hit turbo combos, there was the simple dragon punch and fireball. In this very scaled down version of the original Street Fighter II arcade game, you can choose from a select group of warriors including Ryu, Ken, Guile, Blanka, M. Bison, Chun Li, Zangief, Balrog and Sagat, each with a unique fighting style and special moves. Play through the one-player arcade mode and fight your way through each character in the game to the final boss, Bison, or play against a friend in two player mode.</desc>
	<path>./Street Racer (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Street Racer is a kart racing game similar to Super Mario Kart.

Up to four players can play by split-screen. If there are no human opponents, the player can drive against seven computer opponents in three leagues. If the player wins the first league, they can play the second and so on. The game has eight different vehicles with different skills in speed, haste or resistance. There are also some power-ups on the tracks such as bombs, nitro fuel, and health packs.</desc>

	<desc>Quasimodo straps on his trusty hump one last time to rescue his paramour, the perpetually-imperiled Esmeralda, this time captured by a new villain, the horrible Halfenpounder.  You must run, jump, and eat fruit (can malnutrition cause a hunched back?  Can nutrition reverse it?) through a varied series of platform environments, jumping over (and atop) rolling logs that will briefly daze you if you mistime your jump and spiked pits that will, well, skewer you as surely as in the original, swinging on ropes, and signaling the end of each level by ringing an enormous bell there specifically for that purpose.  Since our pal Quasi is from Paris, not Krypton, and doesn't grow large eating mushrooms, one must conclude that it is the amusing idle animations and hidden bonus stages that lend the "Super" prefix to this game.</desc>

	<desc>Super Kick Off is an enhanced developed version of the popular football game developed by Dino Dini for consoles. It includes 40 teams (16 national and 24 club), along the ability to edit club team names and shirts and player names and looks. Game modes include friendlies, Domestic League and Cup  (composed by eight English teams), European League (16 European teams) and International cup (eight team tournament). Training allows to practice free kicks, penalties or to pass, shoot and dribble without opposition. 
Players can compete head to head, or play cooperatively against the computer in the same team. Other game options include player speed, wind and grass cut, along the typical half length, offside rules, extra time and difficulty setting. All changes, from team edits to options, are stored in the cartridge internal memory.

About the game itself, it was one of the most popular of the time, featuring a top-down view with the ball not sticking to the players' feet being the most prominent gameplay feature.</desc>

Gameplay consists of standard platform action spiced up with some slightly different (gameplay-wise) sequences. Race to Jabba the Hutt's palace in a speeder, fight your way through Jabba the Hutt's minions before killing Jabba himself, control speeder bikes and the Millennium Falcon, and much more.

	<path>./Superman (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Superman is a sidescrolling action game starring DC Comics' titular Man of Steel.  It features character designs based on Superman: The Animated Series.  In each level, you must collect a certain number of keys, and possibly fight a boss, then step on a marked area to leave.  Keys may be found around in the environment or collected from defeated enemies.

Superman attacks by punching his enemies, or by punching to deflect their bullets back at them. He can navigate environments through standard walking, or, he can hold down the jump button to fly. He must be careful of bombs which are floating throughout the levels as running into them causes loss of health. He also must face other environmental hazards, like electrical barriers.

Some levels put ground under your feet and play some like a normal platforming/fighting game, albeit with flight. Others are all flying and forced scrolling, making them something like a 2D shooter with no ranged attack where you must hold down a fly button to stay aloft.</desc>
	<path>./Swamp Thing (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Swamp Thing is based on the DC Comics of the same name. Deep in the swamps of Louisiana, a Dr. Holland, is hard at work on a growth formula for plants. His sponsor however has different ideas for the technology and burns down the lab. The poor doctor is burned and covered with formula and inside of the organically rich Bayou swamps... he becomes Swamp Thing.

The game is a side-scrolling platform game. Swamp thing can punch (but not duck and punch) and jump a short distance. Health powerups will be needed to keep him alive and additionally ball powerups can be found to give him a projectile weapon.</desc>
	<path>./Sword of Hope II, The (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>500 years ago King Winder had sealed the evil Demon Zakdos within a casket, thus ending the dark war. The great wizard Colin pledged that he and his descendants would build and protect a temple around Zakdos' prison. However, as a thief enters the temple and breaks the casket, Zakdos is set free and murders all that are left of the clan of Colin except for a young boy named Mute. To make things worse, the Sword of Hope, that has sealed away an evil dragon, is also stolen. The player takes control of Prince Theo who, with the help of Mute and other characters, must stop Zakdos and retrieve the Sword of Hope before the dragon awakens.

The main difference between The Sword of Hope II and its predecessor
is the fact that you have control over a party of up to three characters rather than controlling only prince Theo. Apart from that, both games play very similar. The world is seen from a first person perspective and your party can be moved by selecting an arrow that points in the desired direction. Commands such as "look", "open", "hit" etc. can be chosen from a menu to explore and manipulate the game-world, talk to NPCs or solve puzzles. When encountering enemies, you enter a turn-based battle mode in which you can attack, use items and magic or try to escape.</desc>
	<path>./Sword of Hope, The (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>A dragon has gained control over the king of Riccar, manipulating him into removing the Sword of Hope from a painting, releasing its curse. Summoning the dark power mammon the dragon turned the people of Riccar into trees. When Prince Theo is born, the king tries to murder him, but Theo is saved by the brave knight Pascal who flees with him  into a forest where three magicians live who conceal the king's castle underground to prevent the evil from spreading. After living in the forest for 15 years, Prince Theo is finally strong enough to try and stop the dragon, using the Sword of Hope one of the magicians had retrieved.

Sword of Hope combines Adventure and RPG elements. The prince can select commands such as "look", "open", "magic", "use" etc. to interact with the game world, talk to NPCs or solve puzzles. When he encounters an enemy, the game switches to a turn based battle mode in which enemies have to be fought in typical console style RPG battles.</desc>
	<path>./T2 - The Arcade Game (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. 

Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).

	<desc>An egg arrives from a far-off planet in outer space.  This egg contains a 'Tamagotchi', a baby alien that cannot fend for itself, and requires your attention and care.  Look after the Tamagotchi and help it grow up.

Tamagotchi is a game based on the popular virtual pet of the same name. In it, you select an egg from the laboratory, and then it hatches in its room. From there, you are fully responsible for its care. Everything from feeding, medicine, playing with it, cleaning up its poo and scolding or praising it when appropriate - you must do it all.

Unlike the actual Tamagotchi toy, the Game Boy version is not in realtime - you can adjust the Tamagotchi's growth speed in the game options. You can also look after up to three Tamagotchis simultaneously. The Game Boy version also features three different games to play with your pet - depending on the game you select, it will improve their mood, their intelligence, or their physical fitness. The three games are:

Smile Game - Your pet will look left and right. Try to guess which direction it will face next.
Study Game - Help your Tamagotchi study. Simple math questions will appear and you must help it answer them.
Sports Game - Keep your Tamagotchi fit. Baseballs will rain down from the sky. Get your pet to them before they hit the floor to score a point.

Another feature exclusive to the Game Boy version are Tournaments. You can enter your pet in Race, Beauty and Knowledge tournaments. You can increase your chances of winning in these by training your pet, but make sure that when you enter them that it's not sick or spoiled, as it will not perform as well as it could. Win a tournament and your Tamagotchi will be placed in the Hall of Fame.</desc>

He has discovered five tropical islands and starts to go through each to find a suitable place. Along the way, he must fight off numerous island hazards, such as quicksand and enemies, while at the same time avoiding the Big Hat Hunter who is bent to send him back to the zoo.

With the help of his trusty tornado spin and the new Taz stomp, he is determined to find a home even if it means fighting a giant dinosaur on Dodo Island.

This game is completely different from the SEGA game of the same name.</desc>

	<path>./Tecmo Bowl (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The most popular American football game to hit the NES console, Tecmo Bowl pits the player vs. the computer in 11 game single-elimination playoff action, or you can go head-to-head with a human opponent in action or coach mode.  There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don't look for official NFL team logos or mascots like Bears or Dolphins--Tecmo Bowl has the NFLPA but not the NFL license.

The play perspective is top-down and the screen scrolls horizontally. Player graphics are large and colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number of players to nine per team. Animated cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats.

There are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the top to the bottom of the screen. Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap. A very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.

There are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off.</desc>

	<desc>Tesserae is a 2-d combination of Rubic's Cube and the more advanced levels of Q-Bert. Simple yet colorful symbol graphics make for endless hours of gameplay... akin to how one can play MineSweeper or Tetris on end, this game got into your head. Gameplay consisted of "flipping" tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal was to clear the board entirely. Higher levels were designated by added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.</desc>
	<path>./Tetris (World).zip</path>
	<desc>This version of Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, and was included with the Game Boy upon its release in several territories. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases and the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

The game is very similar to Nintendo's own NES version of the game, featuring the same "Type A" endless and "Type B" set-clear modes. The game also features a 2-player versus mode that can be played with two Game Boys, two copies of Tetris, and a Game Boy link cable. Clearing lines in this mode will cause the other player's stack to rise, with the goal being to make the other player lose.</desc>
	<path>./Tetris 2 (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Unlike the original Tetris, Tetris 2 has you clearing the field of blocks in a different way. Each play field starts with different colored dots (in this case black, gray and white), with one of each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the same three colors, and by matching blocks of the same color over the top or to the side of the dot will clear the dot and those blocks from the screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the corresponding dots of the same color will be cleared. To complete the round just clear the dots, not the blocks themselves.</desc>

	<desc>All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</desc>
	<path>./Tetris Blast (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>In this version of Tetris, the basic 'clear the line of puzzle blocks' element is still here, but with an added twist: inside the many block shapes are bombs. By linking the bombs while clearing the play field as usual (creating a line of blocks), more of the field is cleared as the bombs explode. 

The usual gameplay modes are included, i.e. challenge, clear as many lines as possible, time trial, clear as many lines as possible before time runs out and 2 player battle.</desc>
	<path>./Tetris Plus (USA, Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>This is yet another updated version of Tetris which was released for PlayStation, Saturn, and Game Boy.  This version features Classic mode, Puzzle mode, Versus mode, and Edit mode.  In Puzzle mode, you must save the professor who climbs his way to the top.  In order to do that, you must clear the blocks away and bring him to the bottom.  Versus mode brings you head to head with another player.  Edit mode allows you to create and save your own custom levels.</desc>

	<path>./Trip World (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Thanks to the Maita Flower, Trip World is at peace. It is being protected by an old Shabubu, a member of a race of bunny-like beings. The flower grows on the holy mountain known as Mount Dubious. However, one day the old Shabubu is attacked and the Maita Flower is stolen. Trip World becomes disarranged and its inhabitants don't stop quarreling with each other. But there is one hope in the form of the old Shabubu's grandson, Yacopu (also spelled Yakopoo).

The player controls Yacopu through five stages in this side-scrolling platformer. The young Shabubu's trademark ability is to shapeshift into different forms. In his normal form, he is able to walk and jump as well as to kick enemies, Yacopu's primary way of attacking. Unlike in many other platformers, many of the enemies don't harm you on contact and push your character around instead. However, certain foes might attack you after you damaged them, while others do so from the beginning.

At almost any time, the player can change to the flying or fish form. Flying Yacopu is able to reach places he wouldn't otherwise be able to, while the fishy hero is best suited for underwater areas. You also come across power-ups that temporarily give your character new powers, such as stunning enemies with seeds, bouncing around as a ball, or attacking with an extended tail. Beneath the mountain, settings in the game include a jungle, the ocean, and a castle. In each stages, you have to defeat a boss at the end. Eventually, you will encounter the one who stole the Maita Flower. The flower must be retrieved in order to save peace in Trip World.</desc>

	<path>./Wario Land - Super Mario Land 3 (World).zip</path>
	<desc>Wario, Mario's greedy rival from Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, is more determined than ever to get a castle after being booted out of Mario's.  He has heard that the pirates of Kitchen Island have a golden Statue of Princess Toadstool that's worth a king's ransom!  Wario figures that if he swipes the Princess' statue for himself, as well as all the other loot the pirates have hoarded, he'll have more than enough cash for a castle that's even bigger and better than Mario's!

Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 is different from previous games in the series in that you control the brutish and greedy Wario. Even when small, Wario can break most bricks with a punch, and some enemies are so weak to him that they'll just be pushed aside! Wario has a body slam attack that he can use to destroy enemies, and he can also pick them up and throw them at his foes. If that wasn't enough, there are three different power ups that Wario can find. The Bull Hat lets him plough through bricks in a single hit, ram his horns into the ceiling to hold onto it, and butt stomp to stun all enemies. The Jet Hat allows him to fly horizontally for a short period of time, and increases his jump height and speed. Finally, the Dragon Hat allows him to breathe a long stream of fire for a short period of time.

To suit Wario's greedy nature, the game revolves around money. Throughout the stages, you can earn coins by grabbing them floating in the air, punching them out of bricks, or by body slamming into foes and then collecting the coins they drop. You can also find hidden treasures buried deep within some levels by finding a key and then throwing it at the skull door to unlock it. Once Wario reaches the end of a level, he usually needs to pay a toll to get the end-of-level door to open. Pressing Up on the Control Pad and B pulls out a coin worth 10 coins, which you must throw at the door. Once the door opens, you can exit and the level is complete. Before you finish each level, you can choose to play a mini-game that doubles or halves the amount of coins you have, with a 50/50 chance. You get three tries, and can choose to leave whenever you wish...so don't get too greedy!

	<desc>Seeking revenge on Wario after he stole their treasure in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, special agents from the Black Sugar Gang of Kitchen Island sneak into Wario's newly built castle, steal back the treasure, and leave the castle and the surrounding area a mess. As Wario, you must clean the place up and take back what you now call your own.

In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable, or they can halt your progress.</desc>

	<desc>Wheel of Fortune is based on the popular game show produced by Merv Griffin.  The goal is the same as the game show, which is to guess missing letters to solve a puzzle which covers the same subjects as found on the show, such as place, person, thing, phrase, etc. Like the game show, the players spin the wheel, select consonants, buy vowels and hopefully, solve the mystery phrase.  The wheel can be "spun" at different strengths by sliding a bar across a selector, and the chances of earning a free spin, losing a turn, and going bankrupt remain.

Game play is for up to two players taking turns, or for one player against the computer. Gameplay moves through three rounds, and a bonus round for a grand prize. Winning is accomplished, essentially, by earning the most money and winning the game by solving the phrases.

There is even a "sexy model" that animates out onto the "stage"--though the resemblance to Vanna White is minimal at best.</desc>

	<desc>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. 

There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.

There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</desc>

	<desc>The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a side-scrolling platformer based on the second animated TV series The Addams Family (1992). The entire Addams family is being held captive by various monsters throughout the mansion, and Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in various parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest, which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards: Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies.

This version of the game is heavily based on the SNES version of The Addams Family - it features the same storyline with another main character and almost identical level design. Another difference to the SNES version of this game is that Pugsley can only take two hits before dying - but there is an additional power-up that makes him faster and gives him an extra hit.

Different terrain types and enemies have to be avoided or used to your advantage to get all the heart frames. Some enemies don't hurt you at all, others only awaken once all heart frames are collected. Some shoot you as soon you cross their line of sight, then there are enemies that fall asleep and stay where they are once you touch them. 

Terrain types include grass that enemies cannot cross, sand that slows you down, but not the enemies, stones that cannot be crossed but also block enemy shots, trees that cannot be crossed but don not block enemy shots, water that can only be crossed with a bridge or an egg, arrows that cannot be crossed in the direction opposite that of which they are facing and others. 

Some heart frames give Lolo the ability to turn enemies into eggs and push them around like boxes. Eggs can be used to cross water, trap enemies or block their shots. In some levels, collecting two heart frames gives Lolo access to one of three items. These items are: A hammer that crushes stones, a bridge that can be used to cross water and an arrow that changes the direction an arrow tile is facing.

	<desc>In the year 2593, on the planet Alpha Centauri 3, Predators looking for a hunting ground plant Alien eggs. The Aliens soon hatch and wipe out the human population. However, when the Predators move in for the hunt, they find they are vastly outnumbered and suffer the same fate. Only one of them survives. He theorizes that among the hatched Aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of Aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan.

The Predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors. Various weapons are available: the standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area. A small radar map helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and also displays approaching enemies.

	<desc>With All-Star Baseball '99, development house Iguana (Turok, NFL Quarterback Club '98) extends its sterling rep for putting great graphics on the N64. The high-resolution visual feast includes multiple player shadows during night games, digitized photos of most players and extremely detailed texture maps -- just check out the ivy and row houses at Wrigley! In stadiums with Jumbotrons, the action on the big screen replicates that on the field. The athletes are fully articulated, with nice use of shading that gives them a fully rounded look. Batters are graded on multiple characteristics, including whether they are pull, straightaway or opposite-field (push) hitters. Iguana has stacked the lineup with signature stances for everyone from Roberto Alomar to Sammy Sosa.</desc>

	<path>./A-mazing Tater (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>This successor to Kwirk  is a puzzle-game with a simple premise but very challenging gameplay. The player has to guide a small potato to the exit of each level, which is made difficult by a number of obstacles. Crates have to be pushed out of the way or into holes to make them traversable, however, since there are crates and holes in several different shapes and sizes, this is much more difficult than it seems at first. Furthermore, many levels contain different types of spinning doors that make solving the levels even more complicated.

The game features four different modes of play: a Beginners Mode in which the basics are explained and the player receives hints on how to solve each level; a Practice Mode that lets the player choose the size of the levels which are than randomly picked; a Puzzle Mode in which the player has to complete 40 levels and receives a score depending on the time it took him to complete a level; and finally Action Mode, which is basically a Story Mode containing two stories. The game also features a password-system and four different difficulty levels.</desc>

	<path>./Asterix &amp; Obelix (Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as it's later counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn't offer a 2 player mode and level codes were added only for the GameBoy Color version.

To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted.

There's an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!</desc>

	<path>./Atomic Punk (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Atomic Punk, which was released as Dynablaster in Europe and Bomber Boy in Japan, is a game from Hudson Soft's Bomberman series. 

The game offers two single player and two multiplayer modes. The single player mode called "Game B" has the classical Bomberman gameplay, while the mode "Game A" introduces several variations. The levels in Game A are divided in nine areas, which can be accessed in any order from a world map. Depending on the time taken to finish a level and the number of blocks destroyed, the player gets a certain amount of gold, which can be used to buy power-ups (called "panels" in the game) in shop, which in term is accessed from the map. Power-ups allow, for example, to revive Bomberman when he dies in a stage or to increase the length of an explosion. Before entering a new area, the player chooses which panels to use in order to complete the area.

The multiplayer mode are both player vs. player modes. In "Panel mode", each player can place only one bomb at a time and the bombs' radius starts at one, but panels appear in the field to improve this. In "Powerful mode", no panels appear, but each player can place up to four bombs at a time and the radius is four.</desc>
	<path>./Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The game's protagonist is Chad Finletter, a young boy is on a quest to stop the evil scientist Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen from unleashing his Doomsday Tomato. During his journey he must fight through legions of mutant tomatoes, although this is a feat he will take on alone as the citizens of San Zucchini are too afraid of the mutant tomatoes to aid him.
Much like other platform games of its time, the main method of killing the enemies is to jump on them, in this case squashing them, or breaking them into smaller tomato enemies. There are several bosses to take on including Zoltan, Beefstake, Mummato, Fang, Ketchuck and Tomacho.</desc>
	<path>./Avenging Spirit (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>In Avenging Spirit the protagonist is a spirit out for revenge. He has been murdered by a group of gangsters and his girlfriend has taken hostage by them. Her father uses his brand new machine to call the man's spirit back from the dead, telling him that they are holding his daughter ransom unless he turns over his research of ghost energy.

In side-scrolling fashion, the game features six different stages - the city, the rooftops, a factory, the city sewers and two levels dealing with the mobsters base of operation. The player is able to possess enemies, 20 in all, and use any skills or weapons they have, to complete the level. The player's health is represented by ghost energy and it is drained when he is not inside a host. The story leads to two different endings.</desc>
	<path>./Balloon Kid (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Balloon Kid is a unique side-scrolling platform game. You control a little girl who's brother has floated away on a big bunch of balloons. It's up to you to chase after him through 8 treacherous levels.  Instead of the usual jumping from platform to platform, you have a pair of balloons that allow you to float through the level. You must control your height carefully by tapping the 'A' button. Meanwhile, the screen is always scrolling to the left, and you have to keep up.

In addition to the single player adventure, there is a 2-player mode that allows you to compete against a friend via the Game Boy link cable. In this mode you try to get your opponent to maneuver their balloon kid into the various level hazards.</desc>

	<path>./Baseball (World).gb</path>
	<desc>Baseball is a game where the player can pitch, hit, field, and run just like in a real baseball game.

	<path>./Bases Loaded (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>The East and the West square off for nine innings of hard hitting baseball in Bases Loaded for the Nintendo Game Boy.  Experience the action as pitchers battle it out against a lineup of heavy hitters using fast, slow, curving and special pitches.  Each player brings their own unique stats and abilities to the game as you work your way through progressively more challenging teams.

This portable version of Bases Loaded is loosely based on the title for the original NES. In this scaled down version Major League teams are replaced with two teams representing the East and West Coast Divisions. With two Game Boy units and a Video Link cable players can go head to head - although each player will also need their own game cartridge. Single players can enjoy a quick pickup game by selecting an unofficial game of 1 to 9 innings. An official game will allow a victorious team to move on to consecutive matches against progressively more challenging teams, a feature that substitutes for the traditional 'Season Mode' of most baseball titles. But you'll have to do this in a single sitting as no battery save option was included.

Play in USA or Japan mode for a subtle change in the gameplay or learn how to best utilize the strengths of the East and West teams. Pitchers are rated 1 to 5 and batters get a rating for both running speed and hitting ability.</desc>
	<path>./Batman - Return of the Joker (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The Joker lives again in SunSoft's sequel to their NES 
original. The Joker has somehow managed to escape from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must fight him across seven stages to restore peace to Gotham City.

Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets by default. This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses. 

Boss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes.

Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, military base, and sewers. Two levels require you to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep pace in the background. Some levels also have Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short side-scrolling shooter. 

This game is one of the few Batman games that was not based directly on a movie or television series.

	<desc>Batman Forever is the officially licensed game based on the 1995 movie. The bad guys this time around are the Riddler and Two-Face.

This game is an usual hybrid of side-scrolling platformer and one-on-one fighter. The player makes way through levels that include some platform jumping elements, but take on opponents one at a time like in a fighting game. The player's arsenal includes a lot of nifty bat-gadgets and a collection of fighting moves that are unleashed with special button combinations.

The graphics were rendered completely with digitized actors and objects, but none of the actors from the movie make an appearance in the game.</desc>
	<path>./Battle Arena Toshinden (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>The Game Boy version of Battle Arena Toshinden is a 2D versus fighting game, instead of 3D. The game features all the eight fighters present in the console/PC version (Eiji, Kayin, Sofia, Rungo, Fo, Mondo, Duke and Ellis), but drawn in super-deformed graphics.

The game features three possible gameplay modes: 1P Game (story mode), Vs. Computer and Vs. Human. The story mode is slightly different from the console version, featuring a different unlockable final boss.

As in the console version, battles can be won either by depleting the adversary's life bar or by tossing him or her out of the ring. Each character has its own special moves and a desperation move (which can only be used when the character has 10% or less of his or her health).</desc>

Just like in Zelda II, there is a top-down map of Greece with towns and other locations to explore. Each of these has side-scrolling sections in which Orpheus fights his way through the minions of Hades. There are various items one must get to continue to the next location, including swords, shields and crystals. There are three fragments of love hidden around; Orpheus has to find them before he can enter Tartarus and fight Hades to save his beloved Helene.

The monsters of the game are also based on the Greek mythology and it is pretty entertaining to confront cyclopes, minotaurs and pegasuses.</desc>

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

After you cross any section of any hamburger, it will drop one level and push any other burger part within that stack down a floor as well. The object of the game is to build all the hamburgers in each stage by dropping all the makings of each burger into completed stacks at the bottom of the screen.

As you go about your burger building business, Food Foes Mr. Pickle, Mr. Egg and Mr. Hot dog (also known as Frank N. Furter) will chase after you. You can destroy these culinary cutups by trapping them in falling burger parts or by tricking them into walking on a burger part you are in the process of dropping. To freeze the Food Foes, you can sprinkle a dash of pepper on them. You begin the game with a small pepper supply and can pick up additional pepper shakers that appear throughout the levels. You can also pick up bonus points (in the guise of cups and saucers) and extra lives.

A password feature enables you to return to the beginning of last level you played.

	<desc>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. 

The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:

1. One Player
Two Player Alternating
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.
Dual Player Competition
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.
Team Play
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.

Scoring
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:

Centipede Head - 100 points
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points

All of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes.

This task is made more difficult by the aliens which constantly swarm out from the portals on both sides of the screen. These can be shot down by the ship's gun (which has unlimited ammo) or eliminated by activating one of the player's limited supply of "smart bombs", which will clear the screen of all current enemies.

The physics of the game were quite unusual for the time; the ship does not simply follow the mouse's movement like a mouse cursor. Rather, it retains its inertia, and must be carefully guided around so it does not crash into anything. Bullets, when fired, travel in the direction of the ship's movement, requiring the player to actually travel toward enemies in order to shoot them down.

	<desc>Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied. This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</desc>

	<desc>Dick Tracy is based on the 1990 film of the same name.  It bears a strong resemblance to the NES release, also from Bandai, but has different levels and lacks the driving and puzzle-solving elements.

Big Boy has escaped from jail and it's up to Detective Tracy to track him down. He must fight, shoot and jump his way through five levels of cronies to face the man himself. Some sections involve negotiating platforms and window sills far above the street, while others involve walking at street level while dodging safes that criminals attempt to drop on you from windows. In all cases, Dick can pummel enemies into submission with his fists or find and use a hand gun, tommy gun or tear gas. The weapons all have very limited ammunition.</desc>
	<path>./Dig Dug (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong (World).gb</path>
	<desc>The big ape has returned in this update of the classic Nintendo arcade game. Although at first it appears to be just a port, the familiar levels from the arcade game are just a prelude to the real platform jumping adventure. Instead of rescuing Pauline at the end of the fourth level, Donkey Kong makes off with her once again!

There are 96 levels spread out over 12 worlds. These levels are much more complex than the originals, featuring scrolling backgrounds, numerous objects to collect, and enemies to avoid. Along the way, you will encounter several "boss" style battles with Donkey Kong, as well.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong Land (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>In a modifiication of Donkey Kong Country, Donkey Kong teams up with his buddy Diddy for new adventures and gorilla antics. Facing high-flying pigs, killer bees, and reptilian Kremlings, the simian duo swings back into action on the Game Boy. The two Kongs each have similar abilities when compared to the SNES game. This game isn't exactly a remake of DKC; for instance, there are new levels and enemies, and Candy Kong does not save your game: instead you must collect all four Kong letters.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong Land 2 (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Donkey Kong has been captured by the evil Kaptain K. Rool. Diddy and Dixie must make their way through more side-scrolling levels in this Game Boy adventure. Fortunately, they will have plenty of help along the way from their friends.

Like Donkey Kong Land, all the graphics in this game are pre-rendered three dimensional models. Gameplay is similar also, and consists of much platform jumping and banana collecting.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong Land III (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>DK and Diddy Kong have left in search of The Lost World after hearing of a contest to find it on the radio.  This leaves Dixie stuck with minding her baby cousin Kiddy Kong.  Frustrated at this, she decides to take Kiddy with her and find The Lost World before everyone else!

As with Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, Dixie Kong takes the lead in the third chapter of the Donkey Kong Land series. Dixie can glide using her hair, and carries barrels over her head. Her partner is the heavy Kiddy, who carries barrels in front of him, and can jump a bit further by somersaulting over platform edges first.

There are also special animal friends that can help the two primates out. Ellie the Elephant can shoot water at enemies, while Enguarde the Swordfish can glide through water with ease. Squawks the Parrot can fly and spit eggs, and Squitter the Spider can shoot webbing as well as use it to create new platforms.

Each level has Bonus Coins and DK Coins tucked well away in the levels. While it's possible to gain an ending without these, to complete the game properly, players must seek them all out and unlock levels of the fabled 'Lost World'. A new feature to the game series is a Time Attack mode - once players finish the game, they can attempt to beat the best time for certain levels.</desc>
	<path>./Double Dragon (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.</desc>
	<path>./Double Dragon 3 (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The final game in the trilogy.

Billy and Jimmy Lee are returning from martial arts training when their paths cross a fortune teller. She tells them of a great evil in Egypt, their strongest adversary yet, and how the Rosetta Stones can aid them.

This game features weapon shops where Billy and Jimmy can buy power-ups, tricks, energy and extra lives to aid them in 
their quest.

Power-ups make Billy and Jimmy twice their size, increasing their damage done and range of attack.

The character graphics have changed, moving away from cartoon style graphics to more realistic looking characters.

	<path>./Double Dragon II (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

Discovering the other evil creations of the castle has taken Bitsy and left pieces of her around the castle, Franky must find his way through the many levels and put Bitsy back together.

Franky can shoot his way past many of the evil creatures, but you must also dodge falling objects and jump over trapdoors to stay alive. Power outlets can re-charge Franky to full health, while lamps must be used to see through the dark dungeons.</desc>
	<path>./Dr. Franken II (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>It is several years after the death of Dr. Von Frankenbone, and things around the castle are starting to fall apart. The electricity bill hasn't been paid in some time, and now Franky need to find the cash to pay it off. The locals have trapped Franky inside the late doctor's private manor, and you (as Franky) must escape and piece together the golden tablet depicting your beautiful girlfriend Bitsy to pay the bills.

Dr. Franken II is a side-scrolling platformer what places you in control of a Frankenstein-like character named Franky. The goal is collect different objects within different levels to put something back together. In order for Franky to recharge his health, you need to find the parts to fix the electricity machine that does it. You will also be taken to exotic locales such as Egypt and the bottom of the ocean to find pieces of Bitsy's golden tablet.

Like its predecessor, there are many trap doors, monsters, and other obstacles that need to be overcome. Keys are needed to unlock new areas of the game, which can be found in the far reaches of the level.</desc>

	<desc>The Game Boy version for Dragon's Lair is actually a port of Roller Coaster, with its protagonist replaced by Dirk the Daring. Dirk must collect all "lifestones" scattered all around the game world (by walking or jumping) to finally save Princess Daphne. The game world is divided in several screens which can be freely navigated and are a little wider than Game Boy's screen. As Dirk moves the screen will scroll and when its limit is reached, it will flick to a new one. To help him move around, Dirk can jump over bumper cars, flying magic hats and other kinds of moving platforms.

Dirk starts with 10 lives which can be lost by falling from high platforms, touching spikes or landing on water or fire. The main theme is somewhat reminiscent from the NES version. The game can be played in two different speeds and can also be played by two players taking turns.

	<path>./Dropzone (Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Dropzone was the first game to propel Archer Maclean to stardom. The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay.

The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. 

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</desc>

He counts on his three nephews and on other Duck Tales characters to help him in his quest through inospit places such as the Amazononic forest, the African Mines, the Himalayas, Transylvania (where he meets Dracula Duck) and even the Moon.

Each one of them reserves the old duck lots of adventure, different enemies and hidden rooms.

The game features a 2D side-scrolling platform gameplay very similar to Mega Man. Graphics are colorful and cartoonish, music remembers players of the TV series and controls are very simple.</desc>

Psy-Crow blasts the captain and the suit falls to Planet Earth.

Back on earth Jim wonders if he is finally safe when an ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit lands on him. Luckily Jim rests in the neck ring of the suit. Then the space particles begin interacting with Jim, causing a light-speed evolution. Jim soon realizes he is in control of the suit.

Jim overhears the Queen's plans for the suit and decides to meet this Princess...</desc>
	<path>./Elevator Action (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.

Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:

1. Shooting them with his gun.
2. Kicking them by jumping onto them.
3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.
4. Crushing them with an elevator.

Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.

While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. 

Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.

Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.

If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</desc>

	<path>./Felix the Cat (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Felix The Cat is a platformer based on the famous cartoon character.

The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix' magic bag. Naturally, Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty. 

There are four different types of levels. 

1. Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies using different weapons.

Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.

Levels that take place entirely under water.

Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.

Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life.

The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</desc>

The player competes against 25 computer opponents representing different F1 teams. Every round consists of a qualification race (1 lap) and a main race (5 laps). The qualification race determines where the players vehicle will be placed at the beginning of the main race. The player is rewarded points which determine their standings at the end of a main race with more points being given for the higher position finished in the race. Also during a race, the player can make a pit stop to change their worn down tires and to refuel, which involves playing a minigame. There is also a practice mode, where the player can choose the number of practice laps they wish to practice.</desc>

One of the Fidgetts can jump higher to reach objects or locations otherwise unreachable. Fidgetts can lift and drop items to help them climb over obstacles. Within each level the player must get both Fidgetts to the exit before a time runs out. There's pit traps and enemies that can cause the Fidgetts to loose lives or receive damage.

In between levels the player can play a Breakout variant in which the player controls a paddle at both the top and bottom of the screen. In between the blocks that can be destroyed with the ball are power-ups that can be collected.</desc>
	<path>./FIFA International Soccer (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</desc>

	<path>./Final Fantasy Legend II (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>The second in the Final Fantasy Legend series increases the amount of detail over the original in gameplay and graphics.

The major changes are in the character classes and party members. Similar to FFL, starting a game of Legends II allows you to choose your main character from Humans, Monsters, Mutants and a new class: Robots. From here, you build your party of 4 from the same character classes. During gameplay special side-characters will join you in battle to help defeat certain enemies. 

The other improvement is in strategy. In FFL you gain experience points after each battle, increasing strength, etc. In FFLII, you gain different points and abilities depending on how you defeated the enemy. If you win by using a sword, your strength increases. If you use magic, your mana increases. This adds a more strategic approach to defeating enemies.</desc>
	<path>./Final Fantasy Legend III (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>The final (no joke) Final Fantasy Legend title to grace the Game Boy, FFLIII tells the story of a great flood which destroys cities in the past, present and future. 
As you control a party of 4, with a choice of human and mutant classes, and travel back and forth through time collecting pieces of the great ship Talon so as to defeat the enemy that has flooded the lands.

The inclusion of a time travel storyline means that whatever you do in one time frame can have an affect on what happens in another time. Other major changes compared to the original 2 in the series are the ability to mutate your characters further and a change to the upgrade system.
Items picked up after battle can be attached to your mutants or humans to turn them into monsters or robots, increasing your parties power and abilities.
And although the original system of obtaning experience points after every battle has been removed, its replacement allows you to choose which magic stone each character can use, so they learn that specific magic type and never lose it.</desc>
	<path>./Final Fantasy Legend, The (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>The first 'Final Fantasy' title on the Game Boy, Legend allows you to choose from 8 different characters, from the usual human male or female to zombie, wererat, redbull (not the drink), clipper or mutant male or female. No matter which you choose, the goal stays the same: Increase your experience points and abilities by defeating many varied enemies through-out the land.

Much like the FF series of old (and new), you can choose members to join your party and the quest that lies ahead (either warriors, mutants or creatures). Every character has a limit to the amount of moves available during every battle and experience points are gained after each fight, increasing stamina, power, etc.</desc>

	<desc>Baseball player Frank Thomas licensed one of the first baseball games to use motion-captured 3D graphics and multiple camera angles. 28 stadia have been rendered in 3D, and each has its own visible and significant differences. 

There are 6 distinct game modes, allowing for single exhibition matches as well as full seasons on the playoffs. There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points. 

You can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it's best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.</desc>

	<desc>The Game &amp; Watch Gallery is Nintendo's first portable compilation featuring their popular line of original 1980's handheld games, featuring the popular "Mr. Game &amp; Watch" himself, as well as Mario and friends.

The compilation consists of four popular titles from the Game &amp; Watch Series, each with a "Classic" and "Modern" version of each game:

1. Octopus: Collects as much treasure as your bag can hold, while avoiding the octopus tentacles that continually swing around you. In the "Modern" version, Mario becomes the diver, and as he collects more treasure, his bag becomes heavier, making it harder to return to the surface. Mario can also delay the octopus tentacles by throwing treasure at them.

Fire: Position your net to catch the falling people jumping from the burning building. The "Modern" version has Mario and Luigi rescuing Toad, Yoshi and Donkey Kong Jr. from Princess Peach's Castle. Each falling character has different weights and falling patterns.

Manhole: The player must cover the holes to keep the continually walking people from falling through the manholes and into the sewers. In the "Modern" version, Yoshi must use his tongue to keep Mario, Toad and Donkey Kong Jr. from falling thought the hole, each character having different speeds and patterns.

Oil Panic: The player must collect the dripping blobs of oil before they slip past and ruin everything. The "Modern" version has Bowser dropping oil blobs at Mario, who has to catch the oil and dump it over to Yoshi before the Koopa King gets the best of Mario.

Each mode (Classic and Modern) has two difficulties: Easy and Hard. The higher score a player gets in each version, new unlockable bonuses will become available via the "Gallery Corner". These bonuses include release dates, pictures and animations which tell in greater detail the history behind Gunpei Yokoi's portable creations.</desc>

	<path>./Game of Harmony, The (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>This strategic action puzzle game features original gameplay. You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.</desc>
	<path>./Gargoyle's Quest (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The friendly Ghoul Realm was invaded by aliens know as the Destroyers ages ago.  The Destroyers almost captured the Ghoul Realm except a powerful fire came from the sky and destroyed them.  The Realm is threatened again and the secret of the fire must be recovered.

You play Firebrand, a gargoyle who has powerful claws that allow him to cling to walls and other surfaces on a verticle plane. Firebrand can also hover and fly for awhile with his wings. Destroy the enemy characters with your firery breath. The game also contains an adventure type story that is unfolded by interacting with characters from an over-head perspective.</desc>
	<path>./Gauntlet II (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Based on the arcade game, Gauntlet II is very similar to the original. Up to four players (a wizard, a warrior, an elf, and a valkyrie) make their way through various mazes, collect treasures and magic potions, and fend off assorted creatures and ghosts.</desc>

	<path>./George Foreman's KO Boxing (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.

Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.

By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.

All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</desc>

	<path>./Ghostbusters II (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Loosely based on the movie of the same name, Ghostbusters II sees Virgo the Carpathian appear in New York city. He captures Diana's baby and it is up to the Ghostbusters to get him back. In order to accomplish this, the Ghostbusters: Igon, Ray, Peter and Winston, must chase Virgo through the courtrooms, the sewers, the apartments, the underground and the art museum.

Ghostbusters II is a top-view action game based off of New Ghostbusters II (the second Ghostbusters II license on NES) but with enough differences to be unique. Players begin by choosing two of the four ghostbusters, who all play the exact same. The first one selected is controlled by the player directly and carries a proton pack, the second ghostbuster is follows the first and carries the ghost trap. The objective of each level is to capture a predefined number of ghosts before the timer expires. The player moves up, down, left and right. One button will fire the proton gun directly in front of the first ghostbuster, stunning any ghosts. The second button will toss the trap directly in front of the second ghostbuster, trapping any stunned ghosts. While exploring the levels, any of the 2 remaining ghostbusters (as well as the ghostbusters' accountant Louis) not currently being used will occasionally show up. Touching them will provide power-ups (and often swap with a selected Ghostbuster) including vacuum guns, instant traps and invulnerability.</desc>
	<path>./Go! Go! Tank (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>A peaceful nation has been invaded by an enemy army, and you must help clear the way for your own forces by plane. You must guide your tank to the end of each stage by arranging boxes with a hook attached to the bottom of your plane, as well as by shooting enemy planes and batteries that threaten it. The tank will roll forward on its own and climb up any wall that is only a single block high -- anything taller and it will crash into it and turn around, taking damage. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed and the game is over. If you get hit, you lose a plane, and if you run out of planes, the game will also be over.

There are several special items to help you on your way, including a power hook that allows you to directly carry the tank, a bomb that can destroy all enemies on the screen, and an option that makes a second plan follow yours and mimic your actions.

The game features ten stages, as well as a 2-player cooperative mode (two planes) when played via link cable.</desc>

	<path>./Godzilla (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Godzilla is a puzzle solving platform game in which you control the radioactive dinosaur Godzilla who is searching for his love interest Minira, a female dinosaur.

In this game with 49 levels you have reach one of the two level exits that will appear when all rocks are smashed.
While climbing the vines to reach the various platforms and trying to smash the rocks you are chased by various types of monsters.

Occasionally, when you smash a rock an item will appear. Smashing an item will activate it.
Once all rocks have been smashed two screen exits appear. Choose one of the two and enter the next level.
Keep in mind that in order to reach an exit you have to smash the rocks in a particular order because if you don't you'll get stuck.</desc>
	<path>./Golf (World).gb</path>
	<desc>Golf features two challenging 18 hole courses where players are able to play a round of golf, and allows players to choose a club, adjust stance and control the swing.

	<path>./Great Greed (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>As Great Greed begins, you are accidentally warped to another dimension by a wizard by the name of Microwave. With no immediate way back, you help the people fight off the scourge named Bio-Haz who is consuming this dimension with evil and destruction.

This new dimension you find yourself in is not terribly unlike the one you came from, with the exception that everyone is named after foods or food-related items and most of the monsters appear to be mutated vegetables and the like.

This RPG breaks from the normal formula in a few respects. The battle system does not use any menus, switching all commands to simple button pushes. A being attack, B for dodge, Start will run and the D-Pad is shortcuts to certain spells. The combat is also live, in the sense that if you take too long to complete your turn, your opponent will attack again.

Using a battery-backed save system, the game will automatically auto-save after every successful battle.</desc>

	<desc>Hammerin' Harry: Ghost Building Company is the sequel to Hammerin' Harry.

This episode has Harry fighting more than just workers. He has to defeat an army of ghosts in a series of environments, including construction site, sewer, airship, jungle, and finally, the headquarters where he meets the evil ghost building machine. Rather than using his mallet, Harry can obtain a spiked ball which does more damage than the mallet. There are five stages, and each one ends with Harry fighting a boss. Upon completion of a stage, the gameplay switches from a beat-em-up to a horizontal shooter where Harry flies through the air, defeating airborne enemies and avoiding dangerous objects.

	<path>./Harvest Moon GB (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Harvest Moon is a farming simulator/RPG where you must build and maintain a farm during the course of a year, while taking care of your budget and yourself. 

You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of farm animals, crops and any other supplies that you may have. You can trade with many of the town's people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend's Game Boy, you can trade items between players as well.

The local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work.

From an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods.

The GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version.</desc>
	<path>./Hatris (Japan, USA).gb</path>
	<desc>In Hatris, the falling blocks of Tetris are replaced by falling hats which are  top hats, cowboy hats, baseball caps, derbys, party hats and crowns. The setting is a hat factory, where hats are dropped down from a conveyor belt two at a time and must be stacked on one of six mannequin heads. Once five hats of the same kind have been stacked on top of each other, they fall down onto another conveyor belt below and are shipped out of the factory, rewarding the player with a cash bonus. (The game keeps track of score as money, not simply points.)  Once you ship out enough hats out of the shop, you go up a level to the next shop. The higher shop number you get to, the more types of hats start appearing to make it more difficult for you to accomplish your task. The game ends when one of your stacks of hats reaches the top of the screen.</desc>

	<path>./Heiankyo Alien (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>1000 years ago the city of Kyo was suddenly invaded by aliens.  A Kebiishi (knight of the past) was entrusted to defend the city.

The game starts with a maze where the kebiishi and some aliens appear. The aliens start moving through the maze wherever they please. While trying to keep from getting eaten, the kebiishi digs holes where the aliens will likely travel. If an alien comes to a finished hole, it will fall in an be trapped for a while. While the alien is trapped in the hole, you can fill the hole to bury it. If all aliens are buried, the round ends and you can proceed to the next round. 

The credits say original concept by TSG, copyright 1979. The Game Boy version includes new original features such as a super alien that has special powers, moves to avoid holes and chases the keibiishi. Two players can play via the video link cable.</desc>

	<path>./Hit the Ice (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Hit the Ice is a fast-paced, high-impact hockey game based on the 1990 arcade game from Williams. Having more in common with Midway's Arch Rivals than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the opposing team's goal, each team only has three players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and it is possible to do a "super shot" which is strong enough to send the goalie into the net along with the puck.

Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a "shot race" mode where the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.</desc>
	<path>./Home Alone (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Kevin is left alone at home while his family is celebrating the holidays elsewhere. Unfortunately for him, two burglars have entered the house to keep him company. Kevin must avoid being caught by the burglars while he gathers all the family belongings and bring them to safety. To aid him in his quest, Kevin has a slingshot and a water pistol, but equally important is proper handling of the environment - a banana skid placed in the right spot or a bowling ball on top of a cupboard will help Kevin in his cause against the robbers.</desc>
	<path>./Home Alone 2 - Lost In New York (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Loosely based on the film of the same name, Kevin McAllister has arrived in New York City without his parents. However he checks himself into a hotel and begins to have fun. It isn't long before the hotel  discovers he's using stolen credit cards and begin to chase him around! On top of that, Harry and Marv the burglars he once defeated, are in town and looking for revenge.

Home Alone 2 is a side scroller. Controlling Kevin McAllister, the player will need to jump over enemies and obstacles while collecting items. These items include health bonuses and a variety of weapons. Losing all of Kevin's health or being "caught" will cost a life. The player starts with three lives for play.

	<path>./Hook (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.

This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels. These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</desc>

	<desc>Hudson Hawk, a cat burglar, has a mission: steal three of Da Vinci's works of art, which include a rocking horse known as "The Sforza", his sketchbook that he called "The Codex", and a precious crystal. The mission will take him through a mansion, castles, rooftops, subways, and the Vatican. Of course, getting all these items will not be as easy as it sounds. Not only does Hawk face security guards, guard dogs, and others, but he must also avoid setting off alarms. To help him, Hawk can either punch enemies, or throw a ball at them.</desc>
	<path>./Humans, The (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Your job in this action puzzler is to help prehistoric man to evolve by helping them discover tools, the wheel, weapons, or even fire. Each level in the game will have a given task to help in this, and you are allotted a number of characters who must accomplish the task. The player can switch from person to person while moving the characters around each scrolling puzzle, and teamwork is essential to success.  

Tasks can include finding objects (like a spear) on the screen, or trying to reach a specific destination which may require the use of objects you have discovered so far. Each level has a time limit, when time runs out the level can be restarted.</desc>

While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. 

You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.</desc>
	<path>./Hyper Lode Runner (World).gb</path>
	<desc>Hyper Lode Runner plays similar to Lode Runner. You must run around on brick platforms gathering all the gold, while avoiding enemies, known as Mad Monks, who follow your every move. You can zap blocks to create temporary holes to trap enemies or to escape through to platforms below. To make levels more interesting there are ladders and vertical ropes to climb, but the enemies can use these too.

There are 50 levels to play, and there is also an editor and a VS mode.</desc>

You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isnt handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.</desc>

You can change settings like game length from 3, 5, to 7 minutes and multiple difficulty settings. Turn fouls on or off and determine if overtime should be decided by a golden goal or extended time.

You can choose various formations and stances for your team and switch players before the match starts and during half-time. Each player also has a current condition which determines how well he plays on top of his regular stats.

While on offense you can take a shot or pass the ball. In defense you can make a sliding or switch the player you control.

There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the game very strategic in nature.  Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question...the question is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (4 way match).  

There is also a "construction set" where players can create their own tiles and backgrounds. But the game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.

The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence.

	<desc>One of many different titles based on Steven Spielberg's 1993 dinosaur thriller, the version for NES and Game Boy is a top-down action game with exploration elements.

Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player must work through six levels by completing certain objectives including rescuing the kids Tim and Lex, restoring power, destroying Raptor nests and finally getting off the dinosaur-infested island. To advance in a level, a number of dinosaur eggs scattered over the area must be collected or destroyed. This will reveal a passcard used to gain entry to buildings, or some other items necessary to complete the assignment. The park's computer terminals can be used to request hints on where to go next.

Naturally, the levels are full of hostile dinosaurs. Dr. Grant can fend them off with his gun. Several ammunition types are available, varying in damage and shooting patterns. Killed dinosaurs will always drop the most basic ammo type, the others must be found. Next to ammo clips, there are boxes with question marks on them to be collected. These might include beneficial powerups like a health increase, but can also be dangerous and reveal a bomb.

Some levels end in boss encounters, including a Triceratops stampede and a fight against the Tyrannosaurus Rex.</desc>

Other fighters are attempting to bring an end to Ultratech's corruption.  

Killer Instinct is a Rare developed fighting game published by Nintendo (and distributed in the arcades by Midway).

	<path>./King of Fighters '95, The (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>The first sequel in the King of Fighters series picks up a year after the end of the first tournament. Once again, fighters from all over the world receive a mysterious invitation to a team-based fighting tournament. And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again...

The King of Fighters '95 introduces Kyo Kusanagi's rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series. The gameplay of The King of Fighters '95 is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the "team edit" concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the "team edit" feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish.</desc>

	<desc>Kirby takes on a new challenge, blockball. The playing field contains a variety of blocks, and using Kirby's rolling technique, you must set him into motion (with paddles situated around the field of play, similar to pinball) to clear the blocks from the field. Each level contains more and more blocks to clear, and after a few rounds you take on boss characters in a one-on-one round to see if you can clear more blocks.</desc>
	<path>./Kirby's Dream Land (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Kirby is a an interesting little super-hero.  Although he appears to be a weak little marshmallow, he is actually quite powerful.  He has the ability to suck up his enemies like a vacuum, and then shoot them out at other enemies.  Kirby can also swallow air, allowing him to fly through the air.

In this game, Kirby must save his land from the evil King Dedede. There are 4 levels of side-scrolling platform action.</desc>
	<path>./Kirby's Dream Land 2 (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Blurb:  Nintendo's/Hal Laboratory's lovable Kirby returns for the gameboy! This time the bridges connecting the rainbow bridges have dissapeared and King DeDeDe is to blame as always...or is he? The evil Dark Matter has him under his control and plans to turn Kirby's Dream Land into a dark world, get the fabled rainbow sword and defeat him!

Gameplay consists of a platform game. Kirby is like no other platform character of it's time because he can fly with no power-ups, and he can swallow enemies and get their powers. In addition to that, Kirby can now team up with his friends: Rick the hamster, Kine the fish, and Coo the owl. Each team-up has it's advantages and disadvantages, but Kirby can still swallow enemies, making more different powers available depending on the power/friend combination.</desc>
	<path>./Kirby's Pinball Land (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Kirby's Pinball Land is a game of pinball based on the Kirby series of games, with Kirby as the ball.  In the game you have to help Kirby defeat King Dedede and the three bosses who each guard one of the Pinball Lands.  

The game is divided into three tables or Pinball Lands, each consisting of four screens, three ordinary screens, and a boss screen If you fall off the bottom of the lowest one, you lose a life, unless you press A at the right moment to activate the springboard, which becomes harder each time. Each screen has a variety of things to do. The middle screen will give access to some sort of bonus game, where you must try to get as many points as you can, and can add to your bonus and bonus multiplier. The bonus is added to your score when you lose a life, as in ordinary pinball.

The aim is to defeat each boss. To get to the boss you must perform a task on the top ordinary screen. The bosses themselves must be defeated by firing Kirby at them, but they will try to stop you, sometimes by temporarily de-activating one or both of the flippers. If you defeat the boss on each table, you face Kind Dedede himself.</desc>
	<path>./Kirby's Star Stacker (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Kirby's Star Stacker is a Tetris-like puzzle game.  There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically.  The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play.  Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types:

Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared. The more stars you clear, the higher the score.

Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen. Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.

Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row. 

Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way.

The game also features a clever 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks. If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further!</desc>
	<path>./Klax (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>An action/puzzle game, the object is to catch assorted color falling tiles and create rows, columns, or diagonals of a single color.

	<path>./Knight Quest (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>You take control of a young man named Will who wants to become a knight. After successfully completing his first quest for the king, he is allowed to serve him as a knight and take on more quests in which he has to free the land of evil monsters and wizards.

Knight Quest is a single-person RPG with turn-based battles. You can explore the land from a top-down perspective, enter houses, inns and shops to rest, buy equipment or receive information on your current quest. Enemies are visible and whenever you walk into one, you are taken to a battle mode that is seen from a side-view perspective. In battles, you have the option to attack, cast spells, use medicine or escape. There are for different types of attacks called "Swallow", "Sea Gull", "Falcon" and "Eagle", that deal different amounts of damage to different enemies.</desc>
	<path>./Krusty's Fun House (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Krusty the Clown's Fun House has been overrun by rats.  You must help him to herd the rats into trap machines to clear them out.  In order to do so, Krusty must manipulate his environment to set up pathways so that the rats are headed in the right direction.  Objects that Krusty move around include blocks, fans, and pipe pieces.

The trap machines are operated by other recognizable Simpson's characters: Bart, Homer, Sideshow Mel, and Corporal Punishment.</desc>
	<path>./Kung-Fu Master (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Similar to Kung-Fu Master games for other platforms but with different levels, it is your job to fight your way through hordes of bad guys and ultimately kill the super-villain. To do this, you can use three different moves: a punch, a kick and a somersault. Sometimes you can also pick up bombs that deal a larger amount of damage. Apart from fighting the bad guys, there are also a few levels that feature Jump'N Run elements. At the end of each stage, there is, of course, a boss waiting to be beaten up.</desc>

The game, based on the film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is very different for each platform. For most of them, the gameplay can be split up into two parts: side-scrolling fighting levels and wild car chases on the streets.</desc>
	<path>./Lawnmower Man, The (Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. 

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</desc>

	<path>./Legend of the River King GB (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>This unique RPG provides a world of fishing as the prime objective.

There are two modes of play, The Fish and Raise.

The Fish: As a young boy, you must search out the fish called Guardian, the only fish in the river that can cure a disease caught by your sister, Teruyo. This mode combines RPG elements such as buying items, talking to the town's folk and searching the local river for the Guardian fish. The fishing element comes into play when you bait or lure fish at the river, in hopes to find a fish.

Raise mode allows you to purchase a fish tank and the extras, and raise a small fish. Much like the many Pokémon type games, you can feed it, keep the tank clean and raise the fish.</desc>
	<path>./Legend of Zelda, The - Link's Awakening (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The fourth game in the Zelda series although it does not take place in Hyrule. After being attacked at sea, Link's ship sinks, and he finds himself stranded on Koholint Island. He awakens to see a beautiful woman looking down at him. He soon learns the island has a giant egg on top of a mountain that the Wind Fish inhabits deep inside. Link is told to "awaken the wind fish and all will be answered," so Link sets out on another quest.

Play is similar to the SNES game with a top down perspective. Link must go onto each of the 7 temples to retrieve a musical instrument that will help awaken the Wind Fish. Along the way, Link must search the land and uncover hidden treasures and items that will allow him to progress on his journey. With new items, he can open up new passages that will take him even farther on his quest and allow him to enter new areas that were inaccessible before. Link can attack his enemies with his sword or use items he finds during his quest to help him. Guarding every instrument is a temple boss, which must be defeated if Link is to awaken the Wind Fish.

	<path>./Lemmings (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 levels of fast-paced puzzling. These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</desc>
	<path>./Lemmings 2 - The Tribes (Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant plot. The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.

Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players. 

The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment.

Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. 

Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.

	<desc>In this game, based on the movie series, you can play as Martin Riggs or Roger Murtaugh to complete four main missions, before taking on a final bonus one. For each mission you can choose the appropriate character. Walking around, jumping and swimming, kicking or shooting the opponents you have to stop the crimes in your beloved L.A.

Firstly, you have to stop drug dealers who want to transport their money from the dock, where you infiltrate. Secondly, you have to stop suicidal terrorists, who entered the subway. Thirdly, you have to defuse a bomb, planted by another terrorist group in the mall. Fourthly, you have to sneak into an office complex to free a hostage, Leo Getz. And finally, you have to find out and stop an ex-police sergeant, who is supplying armor-piercing bullets to local criminals.</desc>

	<desc>Young Simba just can't wait to be king. His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &amp;quot;roar meter&amp;quot; to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</desc>

The player can use Daffy Duck (throwing a frisbee to defeat enemies with Mario-style gameplay), Tweety Bird (elude Sylvester throughout the level), Porky Pig (control a bi-plane to shoot down enemies), Taz (really only a bonus game in which he has to collect as many steaks as possible in 60 seconds), Speedy Gonzalez (elude ghosts and ghouls in a haunted mansion), Roadrunner (of course running from his arch enemy, Wile E. Coyote) and finally Bugs Bunny (gameplay similar to Daffy).</desc>
	<path>./Loopz (World).gb</path>
	<desc>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.

Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.

Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. 

Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.

The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.</desc>
	<path>./Lost World, The - Jurassic Park (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The handheld game based on the second Jurassic Park movie puts the player in the shoes of an agent of InGen corporation who is sent to Isla Sorna, also known as "Site B", where dinosaurs still roam freely.

In each of the eight levels, a number of items (dinosaur eggs, computer disks or DNA samples) must be collected to finish the level. Gameplay mostly consists of running, jumping and climbing through the large platform-like levels. However, in the jungles and caves of the island, many enemies await: Both various dinosaur species, including Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptor, and human enemies, employees of InGen's rival BioSyn. The player can defend himself by using kicks and punches, a pistol or a grenade launcher. Ammo and health power-ups can be found in boxes scattered around the levels.
</desc>
	<path>./Lucky Luke (Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>You play as Lucky Luke, lonesome cowboy, who draws his gun faster than his shadow.  In a received telegram you read that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Pat Poker, and The Dalton Brothers have escaped from jail. You as a good cowboy and law keeper have to catch them and return them back, finishing 12 levels of the game.

Players guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking. There are also objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful items. You also have to use collected items to get past a certain obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull, feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions. Shooting exhausts the six bullets in your gun's barrel. To kill the bandits, bad Indians, prisoners, you should shoot at them for a certain number of times.

Locations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, and at the end of the final level you should challenge four Daltons one after another again.

Some levels are scrolling arcades such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo, or flowing in the rapids. Also the bonus level is present, where you should shoot all the bottles to get and extra life.</desc>

The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</desc>
	<path>./Mario's Picross (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Nonograms are number puzzles where logic is used to find the solution. Clues are provided along the sides of the playfield grid, telling the player how many squares to fill in each row and column. With logic the player can figure out exactly which squares of the grid to fill. The thinking process is similar to solving Sudoku puzzles.

Mario's Picross (from PICture CROSSword) is Nintendo's take on Nonograms. In this game, Mario takes on the role of an archaeologist who chisels away the squares in each playfield. The result is a small picture. There are 256 different puzzles to solve, divided into four courses with increasing difficulty level.</desc>

	<desc>Mega Man is the robot creation of Dr. Light, whose sworn archenemy Dr. Wily spends innumerable games trying to cause trouble with his own odd robots. As Mega Man, you run and jump through futuristic levels, shooting baddies with your blaster, and defeat each of Dr. Wily's Robot Masters. When you defeat them, you can take their ability as your own, which can provide an advantage against other types of evil robots.

In this Game Boy version, Mega Man must fight against Ice Man, Electric Man, Cut Man, and Fire Man. After he defeats those four he battles Quick Man, Heat Man, Bubble Man, and Flash Man. And after that, there's Dr. Wily's Space Node. That sounds like a lot, but passwords will save your progress, if you make it past certain milestones.

	<path>./Mega Man II (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Dr. Wily has broken into the Chronos Institute and stolen a machine called Time Skimmer. According to Dr. Light's calculations, he has used the machine to travel roughly 37,426 years into the future. This can mean nothing good and so Mega Man, along with his dog Rush, sets out to find out more about Dr. Wily's plans.

Mega Man II follows the same formula as its predecessors, meaning the player has to complete a number of side-scrolling, platforming levels that are guarded by different bosses. Mega Man can only shoot left or right, but defeating a boss rewards him with a new weapon. Sometimes he will also find upgrades for Rush, which enable him to use Rush as a trampoline, a submarine or a jet.

While Mega Man II is not a conversion, the first four stages look and play very similar to some levels of Mega Man 2 for the NES. Likewise, levels five to eight resemble some levels of Mega Man 3. The bosses of the first eight stages are also old familiars from Mega Man 2 and 3.</desc>

	<desc>Dr. Wily is at it again!  This time, he's set up an oil rig in the middle of the ocean and is drilling deep down to the earth's magma core.  The reason?  He plans to use the incredible power generated to fuel his latest diabolical robot creation!  Of course, only Mega Man can stop him!

Mega Man III follows the tradition of the previous Game Boy games - you must run, jump and blast your way through four boss worlds. After defeating the four bosses, you will encounter an intermission level. Once this level is beaten, you face four more bosses, then move on to the final showdown with Dr. Wily. This is the first Game Boy Mega Man title to introduce the Mega Buster from Mega Man 4 for the NES. If you hold down the B Button, you'll be able to charge up your cannon for a more powerful shot.

Mega Man III combines Snake Man, Gemini Man, Shadow Man and Spark Man from Mega Man 3 as well as Dust Man, Skull Man, Dive Man and Drill Man from Mega Man 4. In addition to this, there is a powerful Game Boy exclusive boss called Punk, who uses screw-like weapons to attack.</desc>

Mega Man attempts to fight off this new foe, but is quickly beaten by the StarDroid's far superior firepower.

Later, Mega Man awakens to find Dr. Light standing over him, telling him that the StarDroids have almost taken over the world. But thankfully he was quickly able to examine both their firepower and their structures, and was able to modify Mega Man's weapon system into something much more powerful. Mega Man tries this new weapon, and finds that he can now fire his whole fist! Dr. Light dubs this new weapon the "Mega Arm"!

Now, armed with the Mega Arm, and a new companion, the robotic cat Tango, Mega Man must destroy the StarDroids and save the planet while he can! The ultimate battle for the Earth begins!</desc>

While on his way to deliver a very special gift to his girlfriend Minnie, Mickey is jumped by Pete who steals the present and takes off and it is up to the mouse duo to stop Pete and get back the present.

The gameplay is a side-scroller, where players pick up boxes to throw at enemies as well as discover power-ups that include short bursts of invincibility, extra lives and energy boosts that will help the player in their quest. There are five different levels to play in including a lake, a mountain top, a forest and a shopping center and numerous enemies to avoid such as spiders, flying squirrels and even snowballs.</desc>
	<path>./Mickey's Ultimate Challenge (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.

Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</desc>

The core of the game is a side-scrolling fighter similar to Streets of Rage with basic controls for each Ranger (one button punches, one jumps while both buttons combined kicks) and unique weapons for each individual ranger.

Before a level the player can choose which Ranger they want to use and as they progress through each level, not only do they have to fight off bad guys and end level bosses, they also have avoid various obstacles like pits and falling rocks. There is also a bonus level at the end of each and if they player can do well enough, they can extend their life bar.</desc>

	<desc>Muddy Mole's wife and seven kids have been kidnapped by the evil farmer, Jinbei!  It's up to you to help Muddy solve the many puzzles of Jinbei Land.  Snatch all of Jinbei's cabbages in every level, and if you get stuck, dig underground and create your own secret underground paths.  A word of warning, however - Jinbei has got his best goons guarding your family, so you'd better watch out!

Mole Mania plays from an overhead perspective. Although in each room you have to destroy all the foes to progress, the game is much more puzzle-oriented than it is towards action. It is quite common in later levels to get yourself 'stuck', which can be fixed by leaving and returning to the screen to reset the puzzle. One of the game's clever 'hooks' is that players can dig underground in each stage to find a completely different map than they do above ground, which can be used to get through otherwise impassable terrain.

The game also features a two player mode, where one player is Muddy, and the other is Jinbei. Muddy must swipe as many cabbages as possible, and Jinbei must stop him. At the end of the round, players swap roles, and then the player who got the most cabbages wins.</desc>

	<desc>A powerful human called Krond conquers the Monster Planet, bans all music and declares himself king. Max, a monster rock musician decides to fight back. In order to defeat the evil monarch, he enlists in the training course at the Mega Hero Academy.

Monster Max is a surreal isometric adventure by the same duo that created the 8-bit classic Head Over Heels. Not surprisingly it is very similar to that game in terms of control and general design, and almost identical graphically. The character moves on a bizarre landscape, where he has to collect and use objects (with either the A or B button) to accomplish mission objectives. The game starts on a training academy that serves as the mission hub. Each mission has as an entrance with a terminal and a door. By touching the terminal with the character, the mission objective and reward is displayed on the screen. The missions available can be played in any order, but Max has to pay a fee to access other levels with more advanced missions. On the top left of the screen there is a counter for the lucky stars collected. Lucky stars allow the character to touch dangerous objects once without suffering damage. Besides that are several hearts representing the number of lives. On the top right is the inventory display, showing the two objects assigned to the buttons. Hitting START while on a mission brings up a map, while pressing SELECT displays a menu with options and the password at the bottom of the screen.

The game is far larger than previous isometric adventures like Knight Lore, with over 600 more detailed locations (the double of Head Over Heels). There is a password system to save progress.</desc>

	<path>./Mortal Kombat (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</desc>
	<path>./Mortal Kombat 3 (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.

A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.

Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, "Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.

Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</desc>

The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.

To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.</desc>

	<desc>Mr. Chin is hungry!  Help him eat his favorite snack, the delectable peach, by using laser emitting bowls to trap enemies and making them safe to chomp up.   As Mr. Chin, you can drop bowls on the ground with the B Button.  If you place one bowl on the left and one on the right, a laser will fire between the two bowls, and any enemies will be caught between, transforming into peaches.  Mr. Chin can then gobble up the peaches - if he grabs more in a row, their value increases (Mr. Chin's score is measured in calories).  When Mr. Chin eats all the enemies on-screen, more quickly take their place.  Gobble them all up, and when there are no more enemies in the level, you can progress to the next one.

Enemies in the levels can walk on thin line paths, but Mr. Chin will fall through these - he can only walk on bricks. Mr. Chin can also smash the bricks by punching them from underneath - sometimes this will reveal a power up, such as invincibility and the ability to turn all foes into peaches instantly.</desc>

Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

The mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.</desc>

	<path>./Ms. Pac-Man (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

To solve the mazes you must transform the items which are found in the maze into something more useful. For example, a piece of iron turns in a glass key when dropped in a pool of fire. Thus, if you want to pass a glass door, you have to find a pool of fire and a piece of iron. These transformations are not random, but sometimes require multiple stages. If you keep good notes, you'll find out all possible transformations.

Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is an overhead Action RPG similar to Link's Awakening. Players explore towns, dungeons, castles and more, searching for treasure chests and attacking enemies. There are also shops and inns where you can purchase items or rest to recover your strength.

At the end of each level, there is a boss waiting for you. However, to defeat them, you must compete in a mini-game called 'The Surprise Match'. These mini-games usually feature button-mashing of some kind or a variation on a memory match game.</desc>

At the beginning and end of each level, there is a cut scene which consists of a still image with text, to progress the story of the game.

You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons as the game goes on. The gameplay is fairly standard platform work, seen in many other Ocean movie tie-ins.

The Game Boy version of this game differs from the home computer version released around the same time. The level layout is different, there are no ladders ladders or ropes and you don't have to place bombs. This is possibly due to technical or game pack memory limitations of the Game Boy.</desc>

This game is an action side-scroller. Ryu can run, jump and beat his enemies using a sword. He also has a grappling-hook device, which can be used to reach higher platforms, which can then be hand-climbed across. By collecting power ups Ryu can use a magical technique called "the art of the fire wheel", an ascending and spinning wheel of fire which will take more damage than his usual sword. He has up to 5 charges of this technique. Ryu has a life meter with six units, which can be replenished by finding proper power ups inside containers.

The game is divided in 5 stages. Each stages has sub-screens, and the main objective is to go from left to right till the end of the screen, destroying the enemies in the way. Among the enemies Ryu will find humans, cyborgs and machines. At the end of each stage a boss fight awaits Ryu.</desc>

This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or more players. Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the replayability.

When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.

In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.</desc>
	<path>./Nobunaga's Ambition (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. 

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.

During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp;amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.</desc>

	<desc>Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.

Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. 

Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.

The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.

Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</desc>

The game introduces the character of Black Viper to the series' oft-jumbled continuity. Black Viper would later return in the Nintendo DS title, Contra 4, as the primary villain. 

The game features only five levels, two of which are played from an overhead perspective similar to Super C. Operation C is also notable in featuring the upgradable Spread Gun (from three to five shots) and introducing the Hunter Gun. 

There is also the occasional platform element such as jumping puzzles, moving platforms etc., and the mandatory end-level boss.</desc>

	<desc>Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.

Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.

The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.

All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</desc>
	<path>./Pac-In-Time (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Everybody knows what/who Pac-Man is from his heyday in the '80s, but this time, we're getting a whole new adventure of our little eater. Guess his stomach is full, 'cause there's nothing much to eat here, only collecting points. This is much like some Indiana Jones adventure, only your little hero's Pac-Man instead of Harrison Ford.

Pac-in-time is the US release of Fury of the Furries. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed: the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek/Super Skweek/Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man.</desc>
	<path>./Pac-Man (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>
	<path>./Pagemaster, The (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>The Pagemaster was released in conjunction with the Macaulay Culkin part action/part cartoon feature film released in 1994. Guide your character through a selection of levels based around themed books, ranging from Horror to Adventure and Fantasy worlds. You can use magic and stomp enemies to death by jumping on their head. Enemies include bats, flying books, giant hands, ghosts, pirates and many more.</desc>
	<path>./Palamedes (Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The goal of Palamedes is to clear the screen which is, line by line, filling up with dice. Players control a small person situated near the bottom of the screen, who can only be moved to the left or right. The number of the dice the person is holding can be changed with the B button, pressing the A button will shoot the dice upwards. If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once.

There are three modes of play: The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</desc>

	<desc>Based on the arcade game, the object of Paperboy is to deliver papers to your customers while inflicting as much damage as possible to the houses of your non-customers. To make things more difficult, numerous obstacles get in your way including construction workers, rogue tires, skateboarders, dogs and cats, cars, and even the occasional tornado.</desc>

	<path>./Parodius (Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>This is mostly the parody of Gradius (Nemesis on some systems), with some flavor from other shoot-em-ups, like Twinbee. The series is available on numerous platforms.

The game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage.</desc>

	<path>./PGA European Tour (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</desc>

	<desc>As a pilot of a F-4 Phantom II the player's mission is to patrol the skies of the gulf because of renewed hostile activity. Phantom Air Mission is one of the few combat jet fighter games on the Game Boy. It features fully instrumented control panels, HUD targeting, radar and landing displays, complete 360 rotation and many more features. Most missions require the player to take out one or multiple bogeys, without crashing. The game's style is very similar to Flight of the Intruder.</desc>

	<desc>After the success of Pinball Dreams on several systems, a sequel featuring four new tables was created. The gameplay is much the same as the first game, with realistic physics, multi-player options and a high score table to aim for. The tables are Partyland, Speed Devils, Billion Dollar Gameshow and Stones 'n' Bones, taking in a funfair, racing cars, a tacky game-show, and a graveyard. Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams.</desc>

A standard Disney platformer.</desc>
	<path>./Pipe Dream (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>
	<path>./Pit Fighter (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Pit-Fighter is a 3rd-person fight game that features digitized graphics of real fighters and zooming effects.  Players select one of three fighters (Buzz, Ty or Kato) to take on anyone who dares. At the conclusion of a match, players are individually awarded a Knockout Bonus, Brutality Bonus, and a Fight Purse. Every third match is a Grudge Match where players test the skills of each other. The last man standing is the winner of this three-knockdown match. Players fight their way to the Elimination Match to decide who wins the opportunity to dethrone the champion, the Masked Warrior.</desc>

	<desc>Like Pokémon Red and Blue, Yellow takes place in the region of Kanto, which features habitats for 151 Pokémon species. The objectives remain the same as well, though some differences exist along the way. For example, in the beginning, the player is not given an option of choosing one of three starter Pokémon. Instead, a wild Pikachu that Professor Oak catches becomes the player's starter Pokémon, while the rival character takes an Eevee. </desc>
	<path>./Popeye 2 (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Popeye 2 is a side-scrolling platform game in which the player plays as Popeye. The player can walk in all directions, punch, duck and jump. Using the punch attack the player can destroy bricks. When destroyed, some bricks will reveal spinach which can be collected. The number of collected spinach determines the size of Popeyes fist. When Popeye is hit by an enemy the size of his fist decreases again. The player can collect a maximum of seven cans of spinach at which point the player gains a ranged attack where it shoots spinach cans. When the player loses all spinach he dies. Each series of levels is concluded with a level boss.</desc>
	<path>./Pop'n TwinBee (Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>A remake of the classic top-down shooter TwinBee, released for the GameBoy portable consoles.

TwinBee Da!! Puts you behind the controls of two experimental TwinBee fighters as you attempt to rescue Dr. Cinnamon from evil alien forces. In order to do that you must journey through 6 different planets filled with cute and surreal creatures bent on your destruction.

The game uses the classic gameplay mechanics for the genre, with you controlling your craft as the background scrolls vertically towards the end of the stage and trying to survive and destroy all enemies with your laser shots. Twinbee features a selectable power-up system in which you must shoot the bell power-ups to select which type of upgrade you want depending on the color they take (or in this case, the shade of grey).

You, Sam the caveman, are hungry. You travel through various levels, defeating enemies, to gain yourself enough to eat in this side-scrolling platform game. Unlike the other game, the levels and controls differ in this version, due to the limitations of the Game Boy. There are ten levels and after every second level, there is a boss fight. Also, there are only two buttons, jump and attack.</desc>

	<desc>A meteor struck the Earth, and caused great chaos. Seven gods from ancient times awoke, and are now attempting to take control of the post-apocalyptic world.

Primal Rage is a one-on-one fighting game featuring dinosaurs and giant apes as the fighters. The graphics are done with digitized stop-motion animation. Gameplay is similar to Mortal Kombat in that it is viewed from a side perspective, and features deadly finishing moves at the end of the match.</desc>
	<path>./Prince of Persia (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour. You're not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

	<path>./Q Billion (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>In Q Billion, you play a mouse which must level out a playfield filled with stacks of tiles. To do this, the mouse must climb onto one stack and push a taller, neighbouring stack so that tiles fall off, until there are no tiles stacked on top of each other. Oftentimes, there stacks are not adjacent to each other, which forces the mouse to push a tile next to the stack in order to have something to stand on. Since the mouse is so weak, it can only move a single tile. This calls for a lot of juggling, since in order to move a stack of three tiles (represented by a 3 in a square), it must move a single tile next to a stack of two tiles, then move another tile to the other side of the small stack and push the uppermost tile of the stack onto the single tile in order to create a stack of two next to the stack of three. If there is a distance greater than one or two squares between the stacks, it makes the task daunting and requires a lot of planning, which puts this game straight into the old style of Japanese puzzles pioneered by Sokoban.

Later stages introduce tiles of different kinds, symbolised by hearts, squares or stars. These tiles will, when moved together in groups of four, be eliminated; or at least the uppermost layer will. This calls for three-dimensional  or even four-dimensional  thinking on behalf of the player. None of the special tiles must be left on the screen for the stage to be cleared.

A second gaming mode contains ready-made puzzles which must be solved in a limited amount of time. An editing mode will also allow the player to create levels of his own.</desc>
	<path>./Q-bert for Game Boy (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>
	<path>./Qix (World).gb</path>
	<desc>In this game, you guide a marker which must draw rectangles and other weird objects in order to claim your territory, and you can either draw these rectangles fast or slow. Drawing the rectangles using the "slow" method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced "kicks"), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing. Once you have claimed enough territory, you proceed to the next level.</desc>
	<path>./Quarth (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Quarth is a typical puzzle/arcade game. Quarth can be moved  from right to left while the screen scrolls down. The playing field is filled with different blocks and your aim is to fill them in so they form complete rectangles or squares. Only when you succeed in this mission, the concerned blocks will disappear. New 'unformed' blocks appear while the playing field scrolls down making you play into full action at all times. As soon as a line of blocks reaches the bottom line, it is Game Over. Then you 'll be granted 10 seconds to decide if you want continue the level. Each Level consists of 9 Areas and you progress to the next level once you've cleared the last area. The Battle mode is a dual player mode.</desc>
	<path>./Race Days (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Race Days lets the player participate in two different types of racing all on one cartridge, Dirty Racing and 4 Wheel Drive.

Dirty Racing is an overhead view with Grand Prix-style cars similar to Micro Machines on a series of courses while avoiding obstacles and taking out opponents.

4 Wheel Drive is a behind-the-wheel perspective, similar to NASCAR Fast Tracks in a series of off-road courses complete with hills, bumps and sharp curves while trying to overtake opponents. The player is also warned of any upcoming sharp turns by arrows at the top of their windshield.

Two friends can also compete against each other using the GameLink cable.</desc>

	<desc>Race Drivin' is a sequel to the arcade driving simulator Hard Drivin'. Game play is similar to the first game. The player must complete laps around the race track before a  timer expires. There are several checkpoints around the track which increase player's time as he passes. 

Race Drivin' has three courses, one of which is the track from Hard Drivin'. There is a new super-stunt track, and an autocross course. The player also may choose from three types of cars.</desc>
	<path>./Radar Mission (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Radar Mission is mostly a Battleship board game clone with two game modes. The first is very recognizable, with a map to select and place the ships. Then the game is played by picking squares (e.g. A5). There are several different ships, ranging from the five-hit aircraft carriers to the two hit cruisers, even a fighter jet in later levels.

The second mode is more of a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a submarine, trying to destroy the enemy fleet before they take the player's vessel out. Either the player takes out all the battleships causing the enemy submarine to surrender or he directly destroys the submarine to end the level. When submerged a radar view appears, showing the player's ships along with the enemies, providing a strategic intermission to plot out the attack.</desc>

	<path>./Real Ghostbusters, The (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>The Real Ghostbusters, known as Garfield Labyrinth in Europe and Mickey Mouse IV: Mahou no Labyrinth in Japan, is a puzzle/platform game. The story is very simple: Venkman (or Garfield and Odie or Mickey and Mini Mouse, depending on the version you play) walk over a bridge one day, a tile breaks loose and Venkman/Garfield/Mickey falls down a deep pit, which ends up in a bizarre labyrinth, which Venkman/Garfield/Mickey must escape. There's no other goal apart from that, the player just needs to find the exit in each level. Apart from getting there, the exit must also be unlocked. For the latter, the player must collect all gems in the level.

Each level contains various traps and enemies which need to be avoided. The puzzles involve finding keys to lower bridges or open doors, make use of teleporters and especially: drilling away blocks. Conveniently, the player finds a pneumatic hammer at the beginning of the game, which must be used to create paths to certain areas and items, without blocking the way forth or back. There's also an inventory to store items like keys and bombs (used to kill enemies). The protagonist has a health bar and can take several hits before losing a life, but there is also a time limit for each level.

The game features a password system, a password is given automatically after completing a level.

In spite of the differences in main character and a minor variation in the short intro cinematic all regional versions are identical.</desc>

The HUD contains damage and energy meters along with a miniature ring up the top of the screen, useful to see the player's position in the ring so as not to get backed into a corner real easily.

Players can compete in the standard, 1-Player v. CPU, 1-Player v. 2-Player or even a career mode, where there are four preset fighters to choose from along with an option to create customers boxers. The career starts out at position #25 in the ranking and players slowly work up the ladder, going to the gym in between bouts to build up stats to eventually take on "Big Daddy" himself, Riddick Bowe.

The game is practically a copy of Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, save for the graphics style and the included fighters.</desc>

2. Spike, a giant of a man from the means streets of New York
3. Yasha, a masked Japanese wrestler
4. Shadam, a Middle Eastern grappler
5. KO Joe, a former boxer now trying his hand at professional wrestling.

Killer Cane, an unknown wrestler from Canada is faced in the championship bout of the tournament, but he is not a playable character.

	<path>./Road Rash (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</desc>

	<path>./RoboCop vs. The Terminator (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>The crossover of the two 80s Action/Sci-Fi franchises comes to the Game Boy in this platform title, based very loosely on a Dark Horse comic.

The player controls RoboCop, who, while taking care of law &amp; order in Detroit, discovers some unusual troublemakers: Terminators sent from the future. To deal with the threat, Robo will have to make his way through an OCP factory and computer complex, where a time machine awaits that will take him to the post-nuclear wasteland of future Los Angeles. There, he must destroy the Skynet mainframe to free humanity from the machines once and for all.

The game is a platforming affair. RoboCop must destroy various enemies while looking for the level exit, from various criminals in Detroit to advanced robotic probes, Terminators and flying Hunter Killers in in the OCP labs and the future. He is armed with a simple gun which can be upgraded once to a three-directional scatter shot. A single hit means the gun upgrade is lost, though. Life energy can be refilled through power-ups, and extra lives are also available.</desc>

	<path>./Rolan's Curse (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Once the people of Rolan was terrorized by the evil ruler King Barius before he was imprisoned in a castle deep within the forest. When the king many years later was released he immediately unleashed legions of regenerating monsters on the citizens of the land. Now a hero (or two if you play it in multiplayer) is needed to defeat him and his minions.

The game is an action based RPG played with an isometric perspective. As you battle your way through enemy territory you have two weapons, the sword that you start the game with and a Fire Wand that throws fireballs. You will also find some items to use, i.e. a magic axe that can be used to clear blocked passages, chamelon's ring that makes you part of the terrain and shield to help in defense.</desc>

	<path>./R-Type (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>
	<path>./R-Type II (Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The second R-Type brings more of the same shoot-em up action.
Gameplay is identical to the previous R-Type, except you now have two new weapons.

There are six levels, with themes similar to the previous game. Notable parts include an underwater battle in level 2, and a giant Bydo fleet in level 3.

The Game Boy version of R-Type 2 is missing 1 level and both of the new weapons from the original arcade game.</desc>

	<desc>The Rugrats Movie is a traditional 2D platform game based on the 1998 movie of the same name, which in turn is based on the Daytime Emmy-award winning animated television series.

In the game Tommy Pickles' little brother (Dil) has vanished without a trace and it is up to the Rugrats to find a replacement baby for Dil Pickles.

The game features eight levels including Pickles house, the hospital, woods, and ancient ruins. There are two levels in which you drive the Reptar Wagon in a top-down perspective, but the rest features standard side-scrolling platform gameplay. In each level the player has to collect specific items and get to the exit before time runs out.</desc>

The game borrows elements from the classical game Snake but converts it to a multiplayer game. When players form enclosed areas with their tails they spawn power-ups such as rockets which can be fired upon the opponent.</desc>
	<path>./Shanghai (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Shanghai is a tile-based game based on the ancient Chinese game of Mah-Jong.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the center. A tile can only be removed if it is open on at least one side.

This version of Shanghai was licensed from Activision by Hal Laboratory for release on the Game Boy. Unlike the Shanghai series published under Activision, this port contains only a single game layout, that of the standard setup sometimes referred to as "The Turtle" or "The Pyramid."

The game features two options for the visual style of the facecards, either in small designs or in simple letters or numbers. The former is more decorative, but the latter is easier to read. There are also three options for background music that may be selected under a menu by pressing the Select button. Like other versions of Shanghai, there is also a hint mode for when players get stuck.</desc>

Once there, he must fight a succession of 11 opponents, one at a time, with gameplay resembling Street Fighter 2 or Mortal Kombat.

The game's graphics used similar rotoscoping techniques (similar to those used in Flashback or Prince of Persia) making Shaq's 7'2" frame is represented. As well as the story mode, the player can play individual fights, either with 1 or 2 players, although one human player must always be Shaq. Shaq can jump a huge distance, although he struggles to block.</desc>
	<path>./Side Pocket (World).gb</path>
	<desc>The main objective is to cross different USA cities and reach the predetermined scores to go ahead. But remember: you'll have only 16 balls and every error can be lethal!

The game also comes with modes for 2 players with two variants: 2P Pocket Game (the traditional mode) and 2P 9-Ball Game, where the premise is to sink 9 balls before the other player makes them first. If you prefer, test your target in Trick Game or even hear your favorite song in Jukebox.

After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!</desc>

	<desc>Skate Or Die: Bad'N Rad is a Jump'N Run that consists of 7 levels, three of which are viewed from a top-down perspective. The side-scrolling levels play similar to other Jump'N Runs, as you have to avoid obstacles and kill enemies by jumping on them. However, since you are on a skateboard, speed plays an important role, meaning that you cannot immediately stop and sometimes need to drive at full speed to manage wider jumps. The top-down levels play more similar to other Skate Or Die games as gradients influence your driving while you are trying to avoid obstacles, enemies and deadly spikes.

They set off to find the 21 crystals in each area and smurf the world's rubbish in order to get back to their European village. 

So you as male Smurf or female Smurfette should travel from one continent to another. The continents represent North Pole, Africa, Asia, North America, South America, and Australia, and each of them consists of 3 levels. On each level character should collect certain number of crystal shards, which in sum gives 21 crystal shards. During the level character should collect other items to raise a score, avoid or eliminate the enemies specific for each area jumping over them, swim somewhere, or run away from cougar. 

Certain parts of the game may be accessed via password.

The game is available in French/English/Spanish/German.</desc>

	<desc>The evil Gargamel has captured three of the smurfs, so that he can have them for dinner (Once again). One of the smurfs must go out on a dangerous journey and rescue the captured smurfs. Beat the first two bosses to rescue the first two smurfs, then you can take on Gargamel. Make your way through forests, swamps, mountains, mines and more. Also ride storks, mine carts and logs to defeat Gargamel and his minions and to rescue the missing smurfs. 

On each level you must collect five stars in order to get access to the bonus level. (You don't have to collect the five stars in order to get through the main level) On the bonus level, try to collect as many bonuses as possible before the time runs out. There are three bonus levels: "The Dam", "The Mushrooms" and "The Butterflies".</desc>
	<path>./Sneaky Snakes (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>When Sonia Snake is kidnapped by the Nasty Nibbler, only two snakes can save her!  It's up to Attila and Genghis to eat their way through sixteen tricky stages as they avoid nasty traps and open the exits by standing on the scales to open the exit door.

Sneaky Snakes is a pseudo-sequel to the NES game Snake, Rattle 'n Roll. However, instead of an isometric playfield, the game is this time a standard sidescrolling platformer. Players can play as Attila (or link up and play simultaneously with a friend as Genghis) through various devious levels. The goal of each level is to eat enough Nibbleys (round creatures which come in assorted flavors including balloons, jellyfish, joggers, and more) to earn enough tail segments. When your snake has enough segments, its body will flash, and you can weigh yourself to open the exit gate and progress to the next level.

Each level has a time limit of 99 seconds - if this runs out, a giant ax will appear, chasing after your snake until it eventually destroys it. To prevent this from occurring, you can collect clocks which add another 30 seconds to your time limit. You can also collect power ups such as increased jump height, tongue extensions, and diamonds which briefly make you invincible.</desc>

	<path>./Solomon's Club (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Solomon's Club is a sequel to Solomon's Key, which has similar gameplay combining platform gaming with puzzle elements. There are five levels, each with ten rooms. In each room you must retrieve the key and go to the exit.

You can create or remove blocks to your left and right, or while crouching lower-left and lower right. You can use these blocks as platform to climb onto, or use them to block enemies or fire balls. You can also break blocks by jumping from below them, like doing a headbutt. There are several enemies, such as fire breathing dragons, shooting gargoyles and ghosts.

Collect bells to release fairies from the exit as bonus points, and collect coins for money to spend in shops. Some rooms have a shop where you can buy items, such as fire balls or hammers.</desc>

However, plug the cart into a Super Game Boy (an accessory of the Super Nintendo) and you have the option of playing the game in full color, with the original arcade cabinet as border art to the action while you play.

The game is very simple to play. Shoot down the incoming invaders while dodging their fire. They will advance slowly at first towards you, but the closer they come, the faster they get.</desc>
	<path>./Spanky's Quest (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Spanky, a cute little monkey, is locked in a tower filled with equally cute baddies. He must get to the top of four different towers, which can be chosen between when beginning the game. When the four towers have been climbed, the fifth tower remains.

To get through the door and on to the next floor in the towers, Spanky must collect keys, which are sometimes held by the baddies. To aid him, he has a magic ball. Throwing the ball will stun the baddies for a short while, but not defeat them. However, by bouncing the ball it will grow in size, and depending on its size, it will explode in different patterns, and the shrapnel will kill off the baddies, clearing the way and releasing keys.

Published by in Europe by Taito, Spanky fit straight into the company's portfolio of puzzle arcade platformers in the Bubble Bobble vein. The game also exists for the SNES, but the level layouts differ, as well as the fact that one cannot choose freely between the towers.</desc>

The player can run in the side-scrolling levels. The aim is to reach the exit without running out of lives. Lives are lost when Speedy comes into contact with dangers such as enemies, pit traps and sharp spikes.

Speedy can earn points by collecting coins. The game also borrows elements from Sonic. Speedy can run faster and even upside down in loops after running into bumpers. Speedy can also jump higher by jumping on the heads of penguins and when going fast can run through certain walls.</desc>

Things turn worse for Parker when he picks up the morning paper and reads that Spider-Man has been accused of commiting a robbery.  So Spidey sets out on a quest to clear his name.

Gameplay this time around is slightly deeper than the previous title. Controls for jumping, punching, and web slinging are similar, but now Spider-Man can pick up objects that allow him to perform certain actions. For example, in the first level you need to find a key to unlock a door, and a can of oil to activate a hover bike.</desc>

Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away.

When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is full.</desc>

	<desc>This 1991 release was intended to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the 60's television series. The plot of this Trek is based around a giant "Doomsday Machine" that is destroying ships, planets, and other valuable stuff in federation space. The Federation has constructed a weapon to defeat the doomsday machine, but the Klingons think that it will be used against them. So, they steal the weapon and break it up into 12 pieces spread out over 3 planets.

It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to travel to the 3 planets, recover all 12 pieces of the weapon, and finally stop the Doomsday Machine. There are two modes of game play. First, there is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which you pilot the Enterprise through asteroid fields and enemy fleets. Second, there is a overhead-view game in which you maneuver Captain Kirk around the planet to gather up the pieces of the weapon.

Star Trek: The Next Generation is divided into a series of missions.

The game begins on Tatooine, where you, as Luke Skywalker, must travel around and meet up with R2D2, C3PO, Obi-Wan, and so on. Eventually, you travel through Mos Eisley and the Death Star as well. While most of the game has you controlling Luke, Han or Leia directly, some of the various game styles include a first-person Millennium Falcon asteroid belt sequence, and an overhead view Death Star trench run.</desc>
	<path>./Stargate (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D  Tetris. Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate "address" along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.

There are two game modes building on this basic concept:

1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.

Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.</desc>
	<path>./Stop That Roach! (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Stop that Roach! is a turn-based strategy game where the player has to eliminate a number of cockroaches on each level. 

The player has five turns in which he can move of a certain amount of tiles, place traps, stomp to frighten the cockroaches, step on them, hit them with a broom or spray them with an insecticide. Next come the cockroaches' turn, their actions being defined by precise rules. 

If the insects can escape or reach the piece of food you're meant to protect, you lose the round. Victory is achieved if all cockroaches are either destroyed or captured.

Training allows to practice free kicks, penalties or to pass, shoot and dribble without opposition. 
Players can compete head to head, or play cooperatively against the computer in the same team. Other game options include player speed, wind and grass cut, along the typical half length, offside rules, extra time and difficulty setting. All changes, from team edits to options, are stored in the cartridge internal memory.

	<desc>You select your character from the movie (Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, or Chewbacca) before each level, as each one has different abilities, and go try to beat levels based on the movie's scenes brandishing lightsabers, blasters or crossbows, etc. depending on your choice of character.

Gameplay consists of standard platform action spiced up with some slightly different (gameplay-wise) sequences. Race to Jabba the Hutt's palace in a speeder, fight your way through Jabba the Hutt's minions before killing Jabba himself, control speeder bikes and the Millennium Falcon, and much more.

	<path>./Superman (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Superman is a sidescrolling action game starring DC Comics' titular Man of Steel.  It features character designs based on Superman: The Animated Series.  In each level, you must collect a certain number of keys, and possibly fight a boss, then step on a marked area to leave.  Keys may be found around in the environment or collected from defeated enemies.

Superman attacks by punching his enemies, or by punching to deflect their bullets back at them. He can navigate environments through standard walking, or, he can hold down the jump button to fly. He must be careful of bombs which are floating throughout the levels as running into them causes loss of health. He also must face other environmental hazards, like electrical barriers.

Some levels put ground under your feet and play some like a normal platforming/fighting game, albeit with flight. Others are all flying and forced scrolling, making them something like a 2D shooter with no ranged attack where you must hold down a fly button to stay aloft.</desc>
	<path>./Swamp Thing (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Swamp Thing is based on the DC Comics of the same name. Deep in the swamps of Louisiana, a Dr. Holland, is hard at work on a growth formula for plants. His sponsor however has different ideas for the technology and burns down the lab. The poor doctor is burned and covered with formula and inside of the organically rich Bayou swamps... he becomes Swamp Thing.

The game is a side-scrolling platform game. Swamp thing can punch (but not duck and punch) and jump a short distance. Health powerups will be needed to keep him alive and additionally ball powerups can be found to give him a projectile weapon.</desc>
	<path>./Sword of Hope II, The (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>500 years ago King Winder had sealed the evil Demon Zakdos within a casket, thus ending the dark war. The great wizard Colin pledged that he and his descendants would build and protect a temple around Zakdos' prison. However, as a thief enters the temple and breaks the casket, Zakdos is set free and murders all that are left of the clan of Colin except for a young boy named Mute. To make things worse, the Sword of Hope, that has sealed away an evil dragon, is also stolen. The player takes control of Prince Theo who, with the help of Mute and other characters, must stop Zakdos and retrieve the Sword of Hope before the dragon awakens.

The main difference between The Sword of Hope II and its predecessor
is the fact that you have control over a party of up to three characters rather than controlling only prince Theo. Apart from that, both games play very similar. The world is seen from a first person perspective and your party can be moved by selecting an arrow that points in the desired direction. Commands such as "look", "open", "hit" etc. can be chosen from a menu to explore and manipulate the game-world, talk to NPCs or solve puzzles. When encountering enemies, you enter a turn-based battle mode in which you can attack, use items and magic or try to escape.</desc>
	<path>./Sword of Hope, The (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>A dragon has gained control over the king of Riccar, manipulating him into removing the Sword of Hope from a painting, releasing its curse. Summoning the dark power mammon the dragon turned the people of Riccar into trees. When Prince Theo is born, the king tries to murder him, but Theo is saved by the brave knight Pascal who flees with him  into a forest where three magicians live who conceal the king's castle underground to prevent the evil from spreading. After living in the forest for 15 years, Prince Theo is finally strong enough to try and stop the dragon, using the Sword of Hope one of the magicians had retrieved.

Sword of Hope combines Adventure and RPG elements. The prince can select commands such as "look", "open", "magic", "use" etc. to interact with the game world, talk to NPCs or solve puzzles. When he encounters an enemy, the game switches to a turn based battle mode in which enemies have to be fought in typical console style RPG battles.</desc>
	<path>./T2 - The Arcade Game (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. 

Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).

	<desc>An egg arrives from a far-off planet in outer space.  This egg contains a 'Tamagotchi', a baby alien that cannot fend for itself, and requires your attention and care.  Look after the Tamagotchi and help it grow up.

Tamagotchi is a game based on the popular virtual pet of the same name. In it, you select an egg from the laboratory, and then it hatches in its room. From there, you are fully responsible for its care. Everything from feeding, medicine, playing with it, cleaning up its poo and scolding or praising it when appropriate - you must do it all.

Unlike the actual Tamagotchi toy, the Game Boy version is not in realtime - you can adjust the Tamagotchi's growth speed in the game options. You can also look after up to three Tamagotchis simultaneously. The Game Boy version also features three different games to play with your pet - depending on the game you select, it will improve their mood, their intelligence, or their physical fitness. The three games are:

Smile Game - Your pet will look left and right. Try to guess which direction it will face next.
Study Game - Help your Tamagotchi study. Simple math questions will appear and you must help it answer them.
Sports Game - Keep your Tamagotchi fit. Baseballs will rain down from the sky. Get your pet to them before they hit the floor to score a point.

Another feature exclusive to the Game Boy version are Tournaments. You can enter your pet in Race, Beauty and Knowledge tournaments. You can increase your chances of winning in these by training your pet, but make sure that when you enter them that it's not sick or spoiled, as it will not perform as well as it could. Win a tournament and your Tamagotchi will be placed in the Hall of Fame.</desc>

He has discovered five tropical islands and starts to go through each to find a suitable place. Along the way, he must fight off numerous island hazards, such as quicksand and enemies, while at the same time avoiding the Big Hat Hunter who is bent to send him back to the zoo.

With the help of his trusty tornado spin and the new Taz stomp, he is determined to find a home even if it means fighting a giant dinosaur on Dodo Island.

This game is completely different from the SEGA game of the same name.</desc>

	<path>./Tecmo Bowl (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>The most popular American football game to hit the NES console, Tecmo Bowl pits the player vs. the computer in 11 game single-elimination playoff action, or you can go head-to-head with a human opponent in action or coach mode.  There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don't look for official NFL team logos or mascots like Bears or Dolphins--Tecmo Bowl has the NFLPA but not the NFL license.

The play perspective is top-down and the screen scrolls horizontally. Player graphics are large and colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number of players to nine per team. Animated cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats.

There are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the top to the bottom of the screen. Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap. A very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.

There are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off.</desc>

	<path>./Tesserae (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Tesserae is a 2-d combination of Rubic's Cube and the more advanced levels of Q-Bert. Simple yet colorful symbol graphics make for endless hours of gameplay... akin to how one can play MineSweeper or Tetris on end, this game got into your head. Gameplay consisted of "flipping" tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal was to clear the board entirely. Higher levels were designated by added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.</desc>
	<path>./Tetris (World).gb</path>
	<desc>This version of Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, and was included with the Game Boy upon its release in several territories. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases and the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

The game is very similar to Nintendo's own NES version of the game, featuring the same "Type A" endless and "Type B" set-clear modes. The game also features a 2-player versus mode that can be played with two Game Boys, two copies of Tetris, and a Game Boy link cable. Clearing lines in this mode will cause the other player's stack to rise, with the goal being to make the other player lose.</desc>
	<path>./Tetris 2 (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Unlike the original Tetris, Tetris 2 has you clearing the field of blocks in a different way. Each play field starts with different colored dots (in this case black, gray and white), with one of each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the same three colors, and by matching blocks of the same color over the top or to the side of the dot will clear the dot and those blocks from the screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the corresponding dots of the same color will be cleared. To complete the round just clear the dots, not the blocks themselves.</desc>
	<path>./Tetris Attack (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>All is not well on Yoshi's Island! The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</desc>
	<path>./Tetris Blast (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>In this version of Tetris, the basic 'clear the line of puzzle blocks' element is still here, but with an added twist: inside the many block shapes are bombs. By linking the bombs while clearing the play field as usual (creating a line of blocks), more of the field is cleared as the bombs explode. 

The usual gameplay modes are included, i.e. challenge, clear as many lines as possible, time trial, clear as many lines as possible before time runs out and 2 player battle.</desc>
	<path>./Tetris Plus (USA, Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>This is yet another updated version of Tetris which was released for PlayStation, Saturn, and Game Boy.  This version features Classic mode, Puzzle mode, Versus mode, and Edit mode.  In Puzzle mode, you must save the professor who climbs his way to the top.  In order to do that, you must clear the blocks away and bring him to the bottom.  Versus mode brings you head to head with another player.  Edit mode allows you to create and save your own custom levels.</desc>

	<path>./Trip World (Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Thanks to the Maita Flower, Trip World is at peace. It is being protected by an old Shabubu, a member of a race of bunny-like beings. The flower grows on the holy mountain known as Mount Dubious. However, one day the old Shabubu is attacked and the Maita Flower is stolen. Trip World becomes disarranged and its inhabitants don't stop quarreling with each other. But there is one hope in the form of the old Shabubu's grandson, Yacopu (also spelled Yakopoo).

The player controls Yacopu through five stages in this side-scrolling platformer. The young Shabubu's trademark ability is to shapeshift into different forms. In his normal form, he is able to walk and jump as well as to kick enemies, Yacopu's primary way of attacking. Unlike in many other platformers, many of the enemies don't harm you on contact and push your character around instead. However, certain foes might attack you after you damaged them, while others do so from the beginning.

At almost any time, the player can change to the flying or fish form. Flying Yacopu is able to reach places he wouldn't otherwise be able to, while the fishy hero is best suited for underwater areas. You also come across power-ups that temporarily give your character new powers, such as stunning enemies with seeds, bouncing around as a ball, or attacking with an extended tail. Beneath the mountain, settings in the game include a jungle, the ocean, and a castle. In each stages, you have to defeat a boss at the end. Eventually, you will encounter the one who stole the Maita Flower. The flower must be retrieved in order to save peace in Trip World.</desc>

	<desc>Wario, Mario's greedy rival from Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, is more determined than ever to get a castle after being booted out of Mario's.  He has heard that the pirates of Kitchen Island have a golden Statue of Princess Toadstool that's worth a king's ransom!  Wario figures that if he swipes the Princess' statue for himself, as well as all the other loot the pirates have hoarded, he'll have more than enough cash for a castle that's even bigger and better than Mario's!

Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 is different from previous games in the series in that you control the brutish and greedy Wario. Even when small, Wario can break most bricks with a punch, and some enemies are so weak to him that they'll just be pushed aside! Wario has a body slam attack that he can use to destroy enemies, and he can also pick them up and throw them at his foes. If that wasn't enough, there are three different power ups that Wario can find. The Bull Hat lets him plough through bricks in a single hit, ram his horns into the ceiling to hold onto it, and butt stomp to stun all enemies. The Jet Hat allows him to fly horizontally for a short period of time, and increases his jump height and speed. Finally, the Dragon Hat allows him to breathe a long stream of fire for a short period of time.

To suit Wario's greedy nature, the game revolves around money. Throughout the stages, you can earn coins by grabbing them floating in the air, punching them out of bricks, or by body slamming into foes and then collecting the coins they drop. You can also find hidden treasures buried deep within some levels by finding a key and then throwing it at the skull door to unlock it. Once Wario reaches the end of a level, he usually needs to pay a toll to get the end-of-level door to open. Pressing Up on the Control Pad and B pulls out a coin worth 10 coins, which you must throw at the door. Once the door opens, you can exit and the level is complete. Before you finish each level, you can choose to play a mini-game that doubles or halves the amount of coins you have, with a 50/50 chance. You get three tries, and can choose to leave whenever you wish...so don't get too greedy!

	<desc>Seeking revenge on Wario after he stole their treasure in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, special agents from the Black Sugar Gang of Kitchen Island sneak into Wario's newly built castle, steal back the treasure, and leave the castle and the surrounding area a mess. As Wario, you must clean the place up and take back what you now call your own.

In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable, or they can halt your progress.</desc>

	<desc>"Wayne's World, Wayne's World! Party time! Excellent! Woo, woo, woo!"

It's Friday, it's 10:30 and like usual, Wayne and Garth are presenting their TV show. First they start off by reading a top-10 list of the worst games they recently played at the arcade. Then Wayne accounts on how he and Garth were suddenly sucked into a video game, and Garth was kidnapped by the mysterious Zantar. "Weeuuu, weeuuu, weeuuu!" FLASHBACK, and now you're suddenly in control of Wayne as he must embark upon a quest to save his good pal Garth.

Not to be confused with the DOS license, this Wayne's World is a platform- style game. You must jump, fight and rock your way through 4 different levels which include Kramer's Music Store, Stan Mikita's Donut Store, Gas Works and Surburbia. Using Wayne's guitar as your sonic weapon, it's most excellent noise will bring death to various enemies. Will you save Garth from the evil purple clutches of Zantar? SCHWING!</desc>

	<path>./Wheel of Fortune (USA).gb</path>
	<desc>Wheel of Fortune is based on the popular game show produced by Merv Griffin.  The goal is the same as the game show, which is to guess missing letters to solve a puzzle which covers the same subjects as found on the show, such as place, person, thing, phrase, etc. Like the game show, the players spin the wheel, select consonants, buy vowels and hopefully, solve the mystery phrase.  The wheel can be "spun" at different strengths by sliding a bar across a selector, and the chances of earning a free spin, losing a turn, and going bankrupt remain.

Game play is for up to two players taking turns, or for one player against the computer. Gameplay moves through three rounds, and a bonus round for a grand prize. Winning is accomplished, essentially, by earning the most money and winning the game by solving the phrases.

There is even a "sexy model" that animates out onto the "stage"--though the resemblance to Vanna White is minimal at best.</desc>

Occasionally bombs will fall which you may use to clear away a single letter or an entire stack of them, depending on the type of bomb. The larger the words you form, the higher points you receive. If you clear enough words without filling up the screen, you move on to the next level.</desc>

	<path>./Worms (Europe).gb</path>
	<desc>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. 

There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.

There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</desc>

	<desc>Xenon 2: Megablast is vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.

A typical Bitmap Brothers smash, the game is also famous for its soundtrack by British electronica group Bomb The Bass.

	<desc>Fast-paced action-puzzle game where the player eliminates colored shapes that are approaching his alter ego, another colored shape, before they reach the top, ala Tetris.

In order to eliminate the other shapes, you must point your piece at it and 'fire'. If the shape is the same color as your piece, the shape is eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the same color behind it, until your piece hits a piece of a different color. If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.</desc>
