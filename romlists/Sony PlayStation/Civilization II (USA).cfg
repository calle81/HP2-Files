overview The Civilization series of games has redefined turn based strategy on the PC. Now, Civilization II brings the series to the Play Station. Become the ruler of a band of nomads and try to create an empire that lasts from the Stone Age to the Space Age. There are two ways to win: become a military genius and conquer the world or for a more egalitarian approach focus on technological development and be the first civilization to place a colony on Alpha Centauri. Either approach requires precise economic planning, shrewd foreign policy, rapid scientific development, and a well-built infrastructure. Luckily, all of these aspects can be learned from the new step-by-step tutorial. Also new for the PlayStation, the interface has been redesigned to take full advantage of the PlayStation controller. Play Civilization II and find out if you can build the perfect empire.
