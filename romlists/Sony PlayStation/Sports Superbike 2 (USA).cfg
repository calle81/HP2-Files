overview Sports Superbike 2 lets players experience motorbike racing on 15 tracks against up to 20 computer-controlled opponents or compete against another human via split screen action. In Single Race mode, players select from Unlicensed, License A, or License B difficulty settings, with novice, amateur, or professional assistance (braking and steering). Initially, only unlicensed racing is available and the others are unlocked by taking and passing "skill tests." Race lengths include three, five, or ten laps, or a full 100 kilometers. Races in inclement weather are not available in novice mode, and many tracks are unlocked only after completing Championship mode at various difficulty settings.
