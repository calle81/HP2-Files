overview Motocross Mania 2 brings the reckless action of motocross racing back to the PlayStation. Players will experience improved turning, refined graphics, advanced bikes, new stunts, two classes of bikes (125cc or 250cc), and three levels of difficulty spread across 16 tracks. Devoted motocross racers can develop their own tracks with the Edit Track option.
