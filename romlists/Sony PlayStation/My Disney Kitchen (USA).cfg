overview In My Disney Kitchen kids can whip up culinary delights using tons of wacky appliances and gadgets. Using the recipe box as their guide, youngsters can select from an assortment of tasty treats. Kids can bake and decorate cakes, or try out their griddle skills as a short order cook. Joining in on the fun are the neighbors from across the street, Mickey and Minnie Mouse, who love to stop by and visit the budding chefs in the kitchen. The art and voices are reminiscent of Disney's classic cartoons.
