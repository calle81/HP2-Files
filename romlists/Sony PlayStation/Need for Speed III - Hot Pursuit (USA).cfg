overview Need for Speed returns with all the exotic supercars, tracks, and race modes you've come to expect--but reengineered for higher performance, stunning realism, and fierce competition. With Hot Pursuit mode, you can race on both sides of the law: as a cop using radar, dispatchers, and roadblocks to track down speeders; or as a racer, trying to outrun the law. Real-world environments feature details such as blowing leaves, rain, lightning, mud splashes, and smoke from burning rubber and they will put your driving skills to the ultimate test.
