overview A PlayStation version of Strider was produced by Capcom, which was first released in 2000 as a second disc which came packaged with the PlayStation version of Strider 2. The North American release has the Strider and Strider 2 game code pressed onto the wrong disc (so to play Strider you actually need to insert the Strider 2 disc).
