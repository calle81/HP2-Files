overview The third incarnation of the 2D fighting game Samurai Shodown is now available on the PlayStation with the release of Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood. The game revolves around the evil Zankuro Minazuki. Zankuro ravaged lands, tortured innocent people, and burned villages to the ground. Rightfully nicknamed "The Demon," Zakuro attacked hundreds of people, becoming famous for his extreme brutality. 
 
Now 12 mighty warriors search for the crazed Zankuro, each with their own agenda and reason for wanting to kill him. Most are in it for revenge of a loved one killed by Zankuro's sword, some are greedy for his demonic power, and others want to save him and turn him to the good side of nature.
