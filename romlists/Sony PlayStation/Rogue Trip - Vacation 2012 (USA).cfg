overview  Rogue Trip is a demolition derby which permits the usage of ballistic projectiles. Players choose a vehicle and an arena?or a series of arenas in the story mode?to engage in battle with opposing drivers. A variety of weapons and upgrades are obtainable by pick-ups scattered throughout the stage. The last driver alive is the winner. 
 
The story involves the player as an automercenary, hijacking tourists in the various vacation spots of the future and showing them the sights. As there is only one tourist per level, player's efforts towards success will be rivalled by the many other combat-vehicles in the game. Money can be obtained by destroying various scenery in the levels. Money can be spent on upgrades for health and weaponry.
