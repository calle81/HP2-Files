overview EA Sports brings Tiger Woods and the PGA Tour golf series to the PlayStation one last time with their 2001 edition. More than twice as many real golfers are in the 2001 version than the 2000 edition for you to play as or play against. The usual modes of play are featured such as Practice, Exhibition, and Tournament. Up to four players can compete in the multi-player modes. 
 
Compete against 11 pros (including Tiger Woods of course) on new courses. You can even import courses from older PGA Golf titles, or design your own with the included Course Architect.
