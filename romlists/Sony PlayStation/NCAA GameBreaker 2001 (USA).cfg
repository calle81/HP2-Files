overview This game is streamlined and built for speed. With its combination of award-winning gameplay and 2001 updates, NCAA GameBreaker is the best college football game available. 
The first college football game on the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system, NCAA GameBreaker 2001 uses the power of this new system to put together the most menacing offensive line ever to take the college field. With every one of the 115 Division I-A teams and stadiums, your gridiron alma mater should be well represented if they're blue chip material. Mr. Keith Jackson is calling the action all the way in one of the most realistic football audio presentations that includes over 30 college fight songs and trash talk from coaches. And speaking of realism, no game of college ball has come close to the incredible details on the field of this game--look closely at the high-resolution graphics, and you'll see mouthpieces, flexing pads, eye grease, and even mesh holes in the jerseys!
