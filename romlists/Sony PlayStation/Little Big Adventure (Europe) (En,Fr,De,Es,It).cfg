overview Little Big Adventure is a strange and mysterious journey through a surreal 
and dangerous world. You take the role of Twinsen, a young Quetch entreated 
in a dream by the Goddess Sendell to come to your planet's rescue. It is your 
destiny to restore peace and harmony to your world. You begin your quest 
imprisoned in an asylum. From the start it is difficult to know whom to trust 
or where to go. The tyrant Dr. Funfrock has taken over your home planet of 
Twinsun and has imposed his brutal methods of control over the entire 
population. His primary weapons are his ability to clone different species 
and teleport these clones anywhere on the planet. There are four main species 
on the planet: Quetches (Twinsen is a member of this pony-tailed group), 
Grobos (they look like elephants), Spheros (round little guys) and 
Rabibunnies.
