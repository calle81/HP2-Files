overview This version of the FIFA series contained over 40 "classic" teams, so that gamers could play as retired football legends. 
 
It marked the introduction of Major League Soccer, replacing the fictitious "American" league previously included, as well as national leagues from Denmark, Greece, Israel, Norway and Turkey (though Galatasaray S.K. is not present in the game).
