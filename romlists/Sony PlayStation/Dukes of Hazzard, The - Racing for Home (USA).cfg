overview Thanks to reruns on cable TV's The Nashville Network, The Dukes of Hazzard has reached a new audience. Featured as a prime time network series more than a decade prior to the release of this Arcade-style racing game, The Dukes of Hazzard spawned a ColecoVision cartridge in 1984. Now, with The Dukes of Hazzard: Racing for Home, PlayStation owners can get behind the wheel of the General Lee and try to foil the mischievous and downright criminal dealings of Boss Hogg, the fat blowhard in the white suit, and Rosco P. Coltrane, the inept hick sheriff. 
 
The single-player game consists of nine episodes. Each episode is divided into three scenes. Here are just a few of the mission objectives you must complete: find and rescue Uncle Jesse and stop his truck; take part in the Hazzard Overland Race to try and win mortgage money; find Boss Hogg's car and pull it over; and rescue Daisy Duke (the Southern babe in the cutoff shorts) from kidnappers. While racing through each mission, you must avoid cop cars, speed traps, road obstacles and other hazards.
