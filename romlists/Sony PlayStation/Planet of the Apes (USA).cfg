overview You are Ulysses, a human whose spacecraft crashed on an ape-ruled planet. When you are captured and readied for 'examination' you want to save your skin, and thankfully a merciful ape gives you a chance to do so. As a human you have no tools, only your intelligence and some loincloth to prevent staring eyes. The game is played from a third-person viewpoint, and you can meet certain characters and talk to them to get information. Hand-to-hand combat ensues when you encounter an unfriendly ape, obstacles need to be overcome by thinking and some acrobatics.
