overview A digital re-creation of the hobby of puzzle building, Jigsaw Madness offers gamers a collection of 150 different puzzles (across a variety of themes) that can be pieced together, alone or against up to three other players. Utilizing a small hand-shaped cursor, players construct puzzles that range in size from 24 to 96 to 150 pieces, each depicting anything from animals and insects to sports and anim√© characters. Players are given only seven pieces at a time with which to work, and basic statistics such as the number of pieces placed both, correctly and incorrectly, as well as the time elapsed is continually displayed.
