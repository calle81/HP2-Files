overview Based on the 1988 NES game, BLADES OF STEEL, this update delivers detailed hockey physics combined with brilliant, arcade-style animation. You can play any way you'd like, as there are five difficulty levels, five game speeds, adjustable controls, and plenty of other options. Not only does BLADES OF STEEL 2000 include all NHL players and teams, it also has the most complete set of fighting options you'll find this side of a boxing game: you have the choice of several different punch types, and it's even possible to land body shots and tackle your opponent. You can play an entire season, a single game, or jump right into the Stanley Cup Playoffs as you slash and check your way to hard-fought victory. As a GM, you can trade, sign, drop, or create your own players, and the rosters are very easy to manage. Each NHL athlete is graded based on skating, shooting, stick handling, spirit, fighting, and stamina so you know these guys are going to be realistic. Randy Hahn, the voice of the San Jose Sharks, provides in-depth commentary, and the PA announcer sounds uncannily authentic. If realistic hockey and smooth play are your idea of quality craftsmanship, this is your game.
