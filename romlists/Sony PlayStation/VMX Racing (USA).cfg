overview The first motocross game on PlayStation, VMX Racing features eight 125cc and 250cc bikes competing in four single-player circuits: Enduro, National, Supercross, and Full. After selecting a bike, each individually rated in acceleration, braking, throttle, and speed, you'll compete on one of six courses against seven computer-controlled riders.
