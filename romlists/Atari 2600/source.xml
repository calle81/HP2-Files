	<path>./2005 Minigame Multicart (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>This cartridge contains six of the 1 kilobyte entries and one 4 kilobyte entry from the 2005 Minigame Competition with an onscreen menu for selecting the games. The games are:

1. Hunchy: inspired by the Century Electronics game Hunchback, the player takes the role of Quasimodo and must rescue Esmeralda from the cathedral of Notre Dame. Quasimoto can jump across the roof, avoiding guards and assorted missiles.

2. Jetman: inspired by the 8-bit computer game Jetpac, the player must fuel a rocket but avoid getting shot from an unseen attacker.

3. Nightrider: the player is running from a hostile government. They are pursuing you with a helicopter. Just keep running and watch out for the terrain. The farther and longer along the Nightrider goes, the more freedom is worth.

4. Zirconium: an alien race, not carbon-based but zirconium-based, have invaded the galaxy. They have set space mines to protect their mothership. The player takes the role of Captain Joe Diamond, and must fight his way through these mines and destroy the mothership. Careful about hitting mines, as the ship can only take so many blows. Grab any power packs you can.

5. Rocket Command: magma beings are invading from the inside of a volcano. As the rocket commander, the player must destroy these beings' ships before they launch into the sky.

6. M-4: a port of a 1977 Midway arcade game of the same name. The player has unlimited lives and 90 seconds to destroy all that is seen for points. Points are awarded for hitting the wall, the opponent tank, a car and an airplane. If the player or the opponent are hit, the wall is rebuilt and both are returned to thier starting points, but the clock never pauses.

7. Marble Jumper: this is a puzzle game where the object is to clear the board of all but 1 marble, with the last one being in the middle. There are 33 squares and 16 marbles. The player clears marbles by jumping them vertically or horizontally, like in checkers. Diagonal jumps are not allowed.</desc>

	<path>./3-D Tic-Tac-Toe (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>3-D Tic-Tac-Toe is, as the name implies, a 3D version of Tic-Tac-Toe. The object of the game is to place four X's or four O's in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row on the 4x4 board.

There are nine games of which the first eight games are for
one human player against the computer. The numbers 1-8 represent the skill level. Game 9 is a two player game. In the DOS version there are only two difficulty settings and no two player game.</desc>
	<path>./Acid Drop (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>A falling block game similar to Columns. The object of the game is to create a horizontal or vertical line of three or more blocks of the same color, which will then disappear. The remaining blocks will fall down, but won't disappear if they form another line. Every 10,000 points a special block will appear (the Acid Drop) which removes three columns of blocks and marks the beginning of the next level.</desc>
	<path>./Actionauts (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc>The object of Actionauts is to program your robot to perform a series of commands. Use the joystick to set the commands to make the robot walk through a path. On the Commodore 64, you can alter the grid to change the path, the programming is mainly done on the same page and you can select from four robot designs. On the Atari 2600, you select from preset mazes, the programming is on a second screen and you are trying to reach the 'cheese' goal.</desc>
	<path>./Activision Decathlon, The (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. 

The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.

For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.</desc>
	<path>./Adventure (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>A graphic dungeon quest inspired by the old mainframe game of the same name, Adventure is a graphic adventure where you use your joystick to wander around, collecting keys to explore castles, labyrinths and everything in between, whilst slaying anything that moves (i.e. Dragons &amp; Co.) to get treasures. 

The game has 3 difficulty settings:

1. Level 1 (Easiest)
2. Level 2: The Kingdom is larger than Level 1, containing secret rooms and hidden items to add difficulty.
3. Level 3 (Hardest): Similar to Level 2 but all objects/items are placed randomly throughout the Kingdom.

Gameplay revolves around picking up (and dropping) items, hacking your way though dragons, finding keys to open the castle gates and using magic (i.e. reincarnation) in case you get swallowed by failing-to-follow-their-diet-plan-dragons.</desc>
	<path>./Adventures of TRON (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Adventures of Tron is based on the motion picture TRON from Walt Disney Productions.

The game environment consists of 4 floors, each with flying "bits" as well as enemy MCP attackers. The objective of the game is to control TRON (you) in a maze of platforms and elevators while trying to intercept the flying bits (intercepting bits on higher floors are awarded higher points).

Dodge enemy MCP attackers by jumping, using elevators and hitching a ride on the Silver Sailor. Capturing all 7 "bits" will take you to the next level, with added speed and difficulty.

You have a total of 4 lives in play. Make each one count!</desc>
	<path>./Air Raid (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen.

There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends.

The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much damage that they collapse.

There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of these.</desc>
	<path>./Air Raiders (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Goal of the game is to shoot as many enemies as possible (only visible from the side) while avoiding being shot down by flak cannons (which can cause a drop by up to 15 altitude) and to land safely again before the fuel runs out. If more than ten enemies have been shot it is possible to take off again with an ammo equal to the number of enemies being hit.</desc>
	<path>./Airlock (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The player is trapped in a crashed nuclear submarine which has begun taking on water. They need to escape by making their way up the levels of the submarine one at a time. Each floor has two hatch keys that need to be collected in order to unlock the elevator to the next level. There is a time limit, though; if you take too long the floor will flood and you'll be unable to escape. Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes. The player will need to jump over any torpedoes that cross their path, or they will be stunned momentarily and lose precious time.</desc>
	<path>./Air-Sea Battle (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game.  On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen.  The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.

In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft. You are stationary. Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile. 

In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above. On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen. Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above. Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired.

In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again. This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits). The controls are as in games 1-6. 

In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above. Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed. When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired. 

In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below. The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18. The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below. 

In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.

Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds. (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets. I have yet to see this happen.) In each of the single player games, the single player tries to outscore a computer opponent that simply constantly fires.</desc>
	<path>./Alfred Challenge (France) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>As Alfred, you must run, jump and climb ladders to reach keys to open the doors to get to the next level. Watch out for Tazniak and the Bukoï as they are out to kill you. Do not dally, as you have a limited time to complete a screen. There are three screens and a hidden screen.</desc>
	<path>./Alien (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In this game based, loosely, on the movie of the same name, you have to move through a maze (the halls of your ship in the manual), ala Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs). 

If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot (pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.

After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.</desc>

	<desc/>
	<path>./Allia Quest (France) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>As waves of aliens attack, you must kill them all before you are killed yourself. There are eight different aliens, each with different moves and attacks. Your ship is at the bottom middle of the screen. You do not move. Instead, when you push left or right, the enemies shift to that side.</desc>
	<path>./Alligator People, The (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc>This game is based on a 1959 20th Century Fox horror/sci-fi movie of the same name. You are Jane Marvin. Your finance and five of your friends are turning into alligators due to a failed medical experiment. You must get the alligator antidote to cure them.

You, as a syringe, must move about the screen, gathering antidotes and serums. Serums supposedly increase the strength of the antidote so you need less to cure someone. You must then aim at the infected person at the top or bottom of the screen and press your button to inject them. The longer you take to get the antidote to them, the more they will mutate and the more antidote it will require to cure them. Everything is not so simple, however, as there are normal alligators in the swamp and you will lose you a life if they touch you. You can shoot to kill them and it will not cost you an antidote.

Some variations have walls that move. These make it harder to see the alligators, antidotes and serums. Serums only appear in variations with walls. Some variations allow you to pass through the walls, others will make the walls solid and they can crush you if you get between two closing ones. Once you cure all six friends, it is off to the next level.</desc>
	<path>./Alpha Beam with Ernie (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Ernie's ship has run out of fuel and it is up to you to help him.

Use the buttons of the controller to move your ship left or right and beam letters to the correct slots on Ernie's ship. Once all the letters are in place, Ernie can fly away.

This game helps kids learn to recognize letters and match capital letters to lower case and recognize easy-to-confuse letters.

The game manual also contained a read-aloud story.

For ages 3-7.</desc>

	<path>./Artillery Duel (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In this two player game each player controls an artillery gun set in a mountain landscape with the goal of destroying the other player. Players take turns firing at each other; on each turn you have a limited amount of time in which the barrel angle and powder level can be set in order to control the direction and distance of the shot. When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of time you have to make a shot.</desc>
	<path>./AStar (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>Inspired by a calculator game called DStar, collect all the items on the screen in the fewest moves. Your character can only move in one direction until he hits something then he can change directions. If you collect all items on each screen without exceeding the minimum moves required, you win the game. If you exceed the minimum moves for your screen, a tone will sound and the score area will change color. You will not be stopped but you will not have been counted as won.</desc>

	<path>./Asteroid Fire (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Asteroids (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name.

Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon. When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.

The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.

Game Difficulty and Variations
There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 

The game also offers three different game variations:

1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.

2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.

3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.

Scoring
The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.

1. Small saucer - 1,000 points
2. Other player's ship - 500 points
3. Large saucer - 200 points
4. Small asteroid - 100 points
5. Medium asteroid - 50 points
6. Large asteroid - 20 points</desc>

	<path>./Atari Video Cube (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In this game, you control Marvin the Cube Master. You move him around a six-sided cube with nine squares to a side.
The object is to get all nine sides to be one color each in the least amount of time or fewest moves, depending on the game variation you select.

Marvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire button. Marvin will then exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot move onto a space of the same color as he is.

To rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the direction to rotate.

The game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest moves.
Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it rotates, so you don't know what color your on.
Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict you rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces.

Eight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.</desc>
	<path>./A-Team, The (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc>If The A-Team looks familiar it's because it is little more than a graphic hack of another unreleased Atari game called Saboteur.  At one point it was thought these games were the same except for the graphics, but after analyzing them I've found some slight gameplay differences.  On this page I'll concentrate on the differences between Saboteur and The A-Team, for more information on the gameplay itself look at the Saboteur page.  

It's unknown why Atari decided to change Saboteur into The A-Team, but we assume it's because they wanted a game based on the then popular A-Team TV show and didn't want to wait for a new game to be developed. At that point Saboteur was ready for release and Atari decided that they would attempt to integrate A-Team characters into a game that was already finished. The results are interesting at best, confusing to say the least.</desc>
	<path>./Atlantis (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The lost city of Atlantis is under attack! Wave after wave of Gorgon vessels are approaching, each armed with weapons capable of destroying a part of the city. You are in charge of the command posts at the edges of the city and need to defend it from the invaders. The various gorgon craft will keep flying by on the screen in varying numbers and in different flight patterns. At first they fly high in the sky but then progressively lower. If an enemy makes it low enough before you destroy it, it will use it's weapons and destroy one of the buildings in Atlantis. As you progress in the game, the enemy craft will keep increasing in speed. The game ends when all remaining buildings in the city have been destroyed.</desc>

	<desc>This game is based on the first two screens of the Commodore 64 version of Aztec Challenge.

On the first screen, you are running the Gauntlet. Your character runs towards the horizon, from which a pyramid arises as you go, while spears shoot from left or right. You must jump or duck the spears by pushing up or down on the joystick.

After you clear the Gauntlet, you must run up the Stairs of the pyramid while the priests throw stones down at you. You must push left or right to avoid these stones hitting you.

Using the left difficulty switch, you can select to play one level after another of the Gauntlet or play level one of Gauntlet followed by level one of Stairs then level two and so on. The right difficulty switch selects music or sounds.</desc>

	<path>./Backfire (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>The year is 2947. Earth is being invaded by the evil Kcaj clan from the Yenrut galaxy. You are Galactic Commander Frank Drexor. The United States Space Guard has commissioned you with the task of defending the most important sector of the galaxy from the invaders. Kcaj technology is much more advanced than the technology of Earth. Some of the ships have tractor beams. Others are equipped with subspace energy disruptors. These disruptors create energy barriers that will actually cause the shots from your cannons to reflect back at you! If your mission is a failure, the Kcaj will gain control of this vital sector of space, allowing them to maneuver their troops and equipment much more efficiently and gain a larger foothold in the battle for the planet. This would certainly spell disaster for the citizens of Earth. Their fate is in your hands! 

You have a gun on the top of the screen and one on the bottom, each of which travel left or right. To switch between weapons, just press the joystick up or down. You must be careful when you fire because if you shoot your own gun, you will lose a life. There is a yellow spaceship that starts on the row next to the middle row and moves across the screen. Each time it reaches the screen, it moves one row closer to one side. If it gets to your gun, you lose as life. Later in the game, barriers appear in the playing field. You must be careful when these are there as they will reflect your gun's shots back, losing you a life if they hit. In the center, at times, there is a UFO colored either red, blue or green. The red is worth one-hundred points, the blue grants and extra life and the green resets the difficulty to level one without removing the points. Play simply continues until you lose all your lives.</desc>
	<path>./Backgammon (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in this manual.

Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:
All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.
No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.
A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.
After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.
If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.

Difficulty switches
Right:
A=computer rolls dice for you
B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers
Left:
A=computer sets up the board for you
B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

Game variations
Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player
Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player

Games one through four are backgammon
Games five through eight are acey deucey

Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 have a doubling cube.</desc>
	<path>./Bank Heist (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are a bank robber, driving around a maze of streets (representing the city) in a 1930's style car.  Your purpose is clear: perform "bank heists" by driving across white-pillared symbols that represent banks.  As you "rob" each of the banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its place, beginning hot pursuit after a few moments.  You must avoid the cops to stay alive.  Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite, which you can strategically drop to destroy the cop cars.

Besides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to another (as in Pac-Man), there is an additional tunnel that represents the road out of town. By taking it, you will find yourself in the next city. Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and smarter.

There are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one. Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to town, navigating the mazes of streets, and robbing as many of the banks in each town as you are able to. This keeps your gas supply high, and the money rolling in! If you run out of gas, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Barnstorming (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Barnstorming, you are the pilot of a biplane. Your point of view is from the side as the screen scrolls by horizontally. Your goal is to fly through a set number of barns in the shortest amount of time possible. Several obstacles will appear in your way, including flocks of geese, windmills, and weather vanes. Crashing into any of these will cause you to lose speed which will increase your overall time. There are several difficulty levels included which will require that you fly through anywhere from 10 to 25 barns.</desc>

	<desc>A very simple math game for kids.

Each game of Basic Math gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a function, and inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is available to ramp up the difficulty. The game has eight primary game settings - basically two settings for each mathematical function. Games 1 - 4 allow you to select one of the numbers you will be working with, while 5 - 8 give random questions. 

Hint: For division problems that have a remainder make sure to put a space between the whole number and the remainder, which goes to the right.</desc>

He will chase you around the play field and if he catches you, you lose one of your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost.

The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is popped, it turns into a glowing puddle for a short time. While it is a puddle, you can bounce on it without getting hurt.

Game variations
The game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three.

Levels
There are 5 waves per level.

Level 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.
Level 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce on it again it turns off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on again.
Level 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.

Scoring
You get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave.
You score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points even if you are turning on a step a repeatedly.
You get points for completing a level and/or wave. The amount varies by what level or wave you completed.</desc>

The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

	<path>./Chase the Chuckwagon (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Released as part of a promotional campaign for Purina Dog Chow, Chase the Chuck Wagon puts players in control of Chuckie the Dog. Chuckie must be guided through a maze, avoiding objects and the dogcatcher, to the top of the screen where he can go directly beneath the chuck wagon to catch it.

Escaping from the maze allows Chuckie to enter a Reward Screen. Here, Chuckie can find a bowl of dog food in the maze to eat for extra bonus points. If Chuckie misses, no points will be awarded, and he will simply be sent to the next screen.

Chase the Chuck Wagon was available only as an exclusive through Ralston-Purina.</desc>
	<path>./Checkers (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Checkers is a computerized version of the popular board game and follows the same rules; the object of the game is to remove all of your opponents pieces from the 8x8 game board. This is accomplished by moving your pieces diagonally forward on the board; an opponents piece is removed from play if one of your pieces jumps over it (if any of your pieces are able to jump an opponents piece, you must make that move). When beginning the game pieces can only move in a diagonal forward direction until they reach the other side of the board; that piece then becomes &amp;quot;kinged&amp;quot; allowing movement both forwards and backwards. The game can be played by one player against the computer (with three skill levels available) or two players against each other.</desc>

	<desc>The Spectra Island reactor provides power for millions of residents. Ordinarily, there is no problem but there has been an earthquake. This has damaged the reactor, causing it to release radioactive particles. You must use the robot arm to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too much and we have a meltdown.

There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red, blue and yellow. You start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm.

If you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.</desc>
	<path>./Chopper Command (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Chopper Command is a side scrolling shooter. As the pilot of a helicopter gunship, your mission is to protect the convoy of trucks which is travelling at the bottom of the screen. Each wave consists of numerous enemy choppers and jets which are trying to destroy you and the convoy. When all enemies in the current wave are destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult wave. To help out, a long range scanner is located at the bottom of the screen which can locate trucks in the convoy as well as enemy aircraft. Good luck, the ground troops are counting on you!</desc>
	<path>./Chuck Norris Superkicks (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In this action game you play the part of Chuck Norris on a quest to reach a monastery where an important leader is kept hostage. The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.</desc>

	<desc>Pop the balloons and score points. A wall of red, blue and white balloons will appear at the top of the screen. You must pop balloons by catching a clown on the teeter-totter and bouncing him up to the balloons. Use the controller to move the teeter-totter across the screen to catch the clowns. Each time a clown pops a balloon, the balloon will disappear and you score points. Each player receives five clowns or turns. If you fail to catch a clown on the teeter-totter he will crash and disappear from the playfield. Press the controller button and another clown will bounce off the trampoline from the right or left corner of the playfield. After five clowns have crashed the game is over. The clowns may land on any point on the teeter-totter except where the other clown is sitting, which causes them to crash.</desc>

You begin in the bottom right or bottom center and must make your way, via ladders, to the top left to retrieve a ball. Avoid moving obstacles however you can. Be careful you do not touch an obstacle or you will lose a life and be returned to your starting point. When you get the ball, you move on to the next level.</desc>

	<desc>In CocoNuts Stanley the intrepid jungle explorer is under attack from Coco the monkey! Coco is up in the trees throwing coconuts at Stanley. You control Stanley and need to dodge the incoming coconuts. You begin the game equipped with a helmet and an umbrella to protect yourself. Each time you are hit by a coconut, you lose one of these items. You may also regain an item by scoring enough points. The game ends when you have nothing left to protect yourself and a coconut hits you. Of course, the longer you can last in the game, the faster it becomes!
</desc>
	<path>./Codebreaker (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Codebreaker your goal is to guess a 3 or 4 digit secret code which is generated by either the computer or another player. Depending on the difficulty setting, the player has either 8 or 12 guesses to figure out the code by entering in values with the keyboard controller. After each guess, the computer analyzes your input and displays results which indicate if you have a correct digit in the correct position, a correct digit in the wrong position, or no correct digits at all. Points are scored based on how many turns it takes to correctly identify the code. A second game variation called Nim is also included. In this game, two players take turns removing items from a stack. On each turn, a player must take at least one item from a stack, and the player who removes the last item from the screen wins. You can have the computer set up the stacks automatically or set them up manually, and a variation is included where the player who removes the last item from the screen loses rather than wins.

	<desc>Mayday! Mayday! This is Colony 7! We are under attack by the Jarvians! Defensive shield has been raised. We will do what we can to survive.

This is an Atari 2600 port of a 1981 Taito arcade game. The Jarvian have attacked. You must defend Colony 7. You are manning the defensive guns that defend the colony. The Jarvians will send wave after wave to try to break through the colony's defense shield and/or destroy the defense cannons. The defense laser fires non-stop so you just need to use the joystick to place the cross hair over an enemy to kill them. If the enemies get to be too much, press fire to activate the Mega Blaster and destroy all the enemies on the screen.. Be advised that you only have three shots for the Mega Blaster. If the colony or cannons are destroyed, the game is over.

The Jarvian ships are:

1. The Fighter: This is the most common and several attack at once, firing at the shield and colony and, sometimes, your cannon.

2. The Advisor: This will cause the Fighters to target faster so remove it as soon as you can.

3. The Bomber: This one will not target the shield but will try to bomb your cannon. Shoot it and/or it's bombs before they reach their target.

4. The Scout: This one will call in replacement ships so see to it that he doesn't stay long.</desc>

	<path>./Combat Two (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc>The year is 2037. Nations no longer fight monster wars, killing millions. Instead, two combatants enter an arena and fight for their countries honor.

This is a sequel to the 1977 game Combat however, there are no planes, just tanks and missiles. Each player starts in a base in a corner, one in the upper left, the other in the lower right. You must seek out your opponent and shoot them three times to destroy their tank. If they are under trees or, in another game variation, behind walls, you must shoot the trees/walls out of the way first to reach them. Each player has three tanks. The winner is the last one standing.

If you are still in your base, you can press the button to fire a homing missile that will seek out you opponent. When the homing missile hits, it counts as two shots. Missiles must reload between shots and the reloading time is several seconds. If a tank is not hit for several seconds, the 'crew' will affect repairs.

There are game variations for trees, which you can drive but not shoot through, walls, which you can neither drive nor shoot through and versions where you can place the trees/walls where you would like them to be.</desc>
	<path>./Commando (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Several levels await your super-tough Commando in this arcade conversion. Armed with only a standard rifle and a few grenades you must take on hordes of Nazis. Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill form distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.</desc>
	<path>./Commando Raid (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Your city is under attack by commando raiders, and it's your job to defend it! You control a large gun at the bottom of the screen. Choppers will be flying in paratroopers, both of which need to be destroyed. If a paratrooper makes it past your fire and lands, it will damage and eventually destroy one of the buildings in the city. After a building is destroyed, the paratroopers will then begin tunneling towards your gun in an effort to destroy it. Occasionally an airplane will fly by and drop a large bomb. The bomb needs to be shot before it lands, or it can destroy the entire city! The game ends when your gun is destroyed by a bomb or a paratrooper.</desc>
	<path>./Communist Mutants from Space (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Communist Mutants From Space is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. Your goal is to defend your home planet from the various mutant warriors which are attacking. You control an anti-mutant canon on the bottom of the screen, and need to shoot as many of the mutants at the top as you can. At the very top of the screen a Mother Creature will be creating mutant eggs that fall into the formation. The eggs will slowly hatch into various creatures which fly down and try to bomb or crash into your canon. If you destroy the Mother Creature as well as all of the mutants on the screen, you will move on to the next, more difficult level. Several game options are included which allow you to enable or disable a shield, guided fire, a time warp to temporarily slow down the game, and penetrating fire allowing you to take out several mutants with one shot.</desc>

	<desc>Cookie Monster hungry! Want cookie!

You are moving around a maze, collecting cookies and bringing them back to a cookie jar.

Games one through three are one player, games four through ten are one or two player.

In games one, two and three, you move Cookie Monster around the maze, get the cookies and return them to the cookie jar, one at a time. Between mazes, Cookie Monster eats each cookie, one at a time. There are three mazes per game. In game one, there are one, two then three cookies. In game two, four, five then six and in game three, seven, eight the nine.

Games four through six are timed. You can carry multiple cookies and keep playing mazes until time runs out. In games four, five and six, you have five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Games seven through nine are also timed but now you play as the Cookie Kid. You are trying to collect cookies for a surprise party for Cookie Monster. Since he hasn't been told this, he is pacing back and forth on the other side on the fence. Each time you pick up a cookie, Cookie Monster jumps over the fence and chases you. He will each and cookies of the path he is coming down and if he catches you, he will eat all the cookies you are carrying. The times for games seven, eight and nine are five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Game ten in the same as game nine (three minute time limit, you are Cookie Kid and chased by Cookie Monster) except the maze is invisible. When you pick up a cookie, the maze flashes for a second so you can figure out the fastest route to take.

You get one point per cookie in the jar.

For ages three to seven.</desc>
	<path>./Cosmic Ark (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The Alpha Ro solar system is in crisis! Their sun is about to go supernova, meaning the death of all the many planets and the exotic lifeforms who call them home. Luckily, though, the noble Atlanteans have heard of Alpha Ro's plight and have sent a vast Cosmic Ark thousands of light-years across the galaxy to try and save as many species as possible. As the captain of the Ark, the player will have to contend with deadly meteor storms and planetary defense systems to succeed the mission.

Cosmic Ark features two play screens: On the first, the player will have to blast meteors with four-way cannons. Blast enough and the player can go on to the second screen. The Ark descends low over one of Alpha Ro's planets. The player will then have to guide a shuttle craft down and beam aboard two creatures, while avoiding any laser defense system that may be in operation. The player will have to get the creatures back on board quickly, because another meteor shower could happen at any moment. Then it's off to the next planet!</desc>
	<path>./Cosmic Commuter (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Cosmic Commuter takes place in the year 2075. You work for the Galactic Travel Agency, and need to help the citizens commute to and from work! Each level consists of several parts. First, you must successfully land the rocket module on the planet surface (this contains your astrobus). This part of the game is similar to the game Lunar Lander; you must control the speed of the lander to make sure you don't crash! In the second, horizontally scrolling segment you control the astrobus and attempt to pick up the commuters at the bus stops. Once all of the commuters are picked up, return to the rocket module and take off to transport the commuters to the grand central space station. Of course, there are many obstacles which can prevent a successful mission. Meteors, fireballs and space mines all get in the way and can destroy your astrobus. Your astrobus is equipped with a laser that can be used to destroy these obstacles. The astrobus also has a limited amount of fuel; if you start running out you better find more fuel before you crash!</desc>
	<path>./Cosmic Creeps (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Civilization is doomed! You are our last hope! You must protect the Cosmic Kids from the Cosmic Creeps as they escape the orbit-decaying planet!

The first part of the game is The Voyage. You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay a little more

The second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.

If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety. You need to score 5000 points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you will start the Voyage again, only faster.</desc>

	<desc>You are at the Waypoint Interstellar Trade Depot, a quiet outpost in space, when suddenly a dormant group of alien, mineral-eating termites awakens. They then begin haphazardly making their nest.

Using your probe ship, you must destroy the termites and their nest blocks. You simply fire at the termites to destroy them but their nest blocks must be energized before you can destroy them. To energize a nest block, you must hit a block while a termite is still carrying it. This will energize all the blocks on the screen.

If you shoot a termite that is not carrying a block or if one is carrying a block but you only hit the termite, all the blocks will not be energized and not be damageable. If you run into a block, energized or not, or are touched by a termite, you lose a life.

Every so often, a refuel ship travels down and then back up the left or right side of the screen. You must dock with it (touch it) before it gets back to the top or the game ends, no matter how many lives you have left.

To fire, press the fire button. To move, move the joystick while the button is not pressed. If you hold down the button, you can rotate left or right then you will stay at that angle until you rotate again.

The points are:
Shooting a termite that is NOT carrying a block=1 point
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block but only hitting the termite=2 points
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block and hitting the block=3 points
Shooting an energized block=1 point</desc>

	<desc>As a professional ornithologist, you're thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills have nested in your "old yolk tree." But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.

You get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site.</desc>

	<desc>A barrage of bugs are attacking your home, and you need to defend it with potted plants! You control your character at the top of the screen where there are six potted plants. These can be dropped on the bugs to destroy them as they make their way up from the sewer at the bottom. Just beneath the potted plants are six windows; you need to make sure you destroy the bugs before they can reach these windows. If six of the bugs make it into the windows, a layer of your house will be eaten. This will drop you one step closer to the bottom of the screen, making it more difficult to destroy the incoming bugs! The game ends when six layers of the building have been eaten. There are four different color bugs in the game, each of which have a different pattern of movement. As the levels progress, bugs will keep coming faster and faster!</desc>
	<path>./Crash Dive (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The object of this game is to use your flying sub, the Sea Hunter,  to destroy enemies and get treasures.

You move fastest when in the air, half speed when in the water and cannot move forward when on the sea bottom.

Your enemies and their point values are:
Plane = 300
Helicopter = 100
Bird = 0
Boat = 50
Sting Ray = 20
Shark = 100
Angler Fish = 200
Squid = 100
Lobster = 25

You get 1 point for stunning the sea monster but cannot kill him. You cannot do anything with mines but avoid them.

The possible treasures and their point values are:
Sword = 200
Wine Bottle = 400
Sunken Boat = 500
Crown = 1000
Chalice = 2000
Pot of Gold = 3000
Key = 5000

You just play until you crash your sub or run out of fuel. You refuel by docking with the sub at the top of the sea (looks like a boat without a gun) called Sea View.</desc>
	<path>./Crazy Balloon (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>In this game, you try to get your balloon from one point to the end of a spike-walled maze, without popping it. Your balloon constantly sways back and forth so you must be cautious. You cannot take all day because you are timed, as well. To make matters worse, in the later levels, you face moving spikes, Hurricane Man, who will try to blow you into a wall, and magnets that try to drag you into the wall. There are sixteen levels total.</desc>
	<path>./Crazy Climber (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.

The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects, another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 

Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.</desc>

But now, our scientists have developed our newest weapon, the Spectron! You will be deployed with this weapon and must destroy as many Morplus as you can.

You have two lasers, one at the top that fires down and one at the bottom that fires up. You control both lasers. Depending on what you select, you can have both lasers stay parallel to each other or move opposite of each other. Your goal is to fire the laser, which fires from one laser to the other, and destroy any enemies caught in your crossfire. The mothership that drops the enemies is indestructible.

Be aware, however, that if you fire you weapon non-stop, it will overheat and then will not fire until it cools a little. Also be aware of the amount of fuel you have because if you run out of fuel, you lose one life. You need to shoot any red fuel pods when they appear on screen.</desc>
	<path>./Crossbow (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Crossbow, you and several friends are trying to cross many treacherous landscapes in order to retrieve stolen treasures from the castle of the Evil Master. All of the members of your party are unarmed, however you carry a crossbow. Using this, you need to shoot any obstacles or hostile enemies that may get in the way of your friends as they cross the screen. You see the landscape from a first person point of view, and one by one each member of the party will walk from the left to right on the screen. There are many different landscapes that need to be crossed, each with its own variety of dangers. There are deserts with scorpions, ice caverns, jungles with hostile monkeys, a lava spewing volcano, and even the heavily guarded castle. The game starts with two friends in your party, with additional friends joining after clearing certain parts of the game. The game ends when everyone in your party has been killed.</desc>
	<path>./Crypts of Chaos (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This is a role playing game, sort of.

The object is to kill monsters in the crypts and get any treasure you can find and get out on the crypts.

How deep in the crypt you start depends on the game selection. Games one, two, three, or four place you at levels five, nine, thirteen, or one, respectively.

Your weapons are a sword (unlimited attacks but useless against wizards), wand (limited attacks, depending on game selection, useless on dragons), ring of power (limited attacks, depending on game selection), and peace symbol (unlimited uses but you get no points and only useful on trolls, eyes, wizards and dragons).

Your enemies are trolls, frogs, snakes, skulls, blobs, eyes, wizards and dragons. Level one has only trolls, level two has trolls and frogs, level three has trolls, frogs and snakes, etc. up to level eight and below which has everything.</desc>
	<path>./Crystal Castles (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Bentley Bear is trapped in the Crystal Castles! To get out, he will need to collect all of the gems located throughout the castle. The game is played with an isometric view of the multi platformed castle. When Bentley collects all of the gems on the current castle, he will move on to the next, more difficult castle. Wandering throughout the castles are a wide variety of dangerous creatures, which Bentley should avoid. From time to time, a magic hat will appear. If Bentley collects the hat, he will temporarily be invincible to the castles inhabitants.</desc>

	<desc>You are General Custer. Your dander's up, your pistol's wavin'. You've set your sights on a ravishing maiden named Revenge; but she's not about to take it lying down, by George! Help is on the way. If you're to get to Revenge, you'll have to rise to the challenge, dodge a tribe of flying arrows and protect your flanks against some downright mean and prickly cactus. But if you can stand pat and last past the stings and arrows - you can stand last. Remember - Revenge is sweet! Every time ol' Custer scores, he comes up smilin' and right back for more. The higher the score, the more challenging the game action gets!</desc>
	<path>./Dancing Plate (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Would you like to try this traditional Chinese variety dancing plate game? Now it's your turn! Have several plates revolve on the tops of different wands and keep them all in balance. If a plate falls, rush to get it, otherwise, in case you break too many plates, it's the other player's turn.</desc>
	<path>./Dark Cavern (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>It's a battle for survival in an underground cavern!  You have five men. They enter the cavern one at a time through the center trap door.  Once inside, blobs, spiders and robots begin to enter the left and right doors. (Neither the creatures nor the man can exit through these doors.)

Direct your man down the tunnels. Pick up ammunition as you go. Keep clear of the creatures... avoid robot fire. Shoot to destroy! Get hit by a robot's bullet... action stops.

Now bring out your next man... get them before they get you!!!</desc>
	<path>./Dark Chambers (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Dark Chambers is an arcade action game similar to Gauntlet. You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can. Hidden somewhere in each of the levels is an exit which will take you on to the next level. Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>
	<path>./Dark Mage (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>Who knew? You thought you could play cards better than that when drunk. But now you've done it. You lost King Roland the Insane's black rose in a card game with the Dark Mage so you've been banished. The only way you can go home again is to find and return that black rose.

Use a joystick to take items, talk to characters and go places to find the king's rose.
Inspired by text-based games like those released by Infocom, you do not type here. Instead, you move the joystick to change the selection at the bottom of the screen then press the button to select.</desc>
	<path>./Deadly Duck (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are Deadly Duck and the object is to shoot your bill bullets at crabs, the bricks they drop and dragonflies.

Each level starts with eight crabs. The crabs grab bricks from the sides and try to drop them on you. You can shoot the bricks as they fall and the crabs but if a brick lands on you, you're a dead duck.
When a brick lands, it will stay on the pond for a moment, blocking you from moving horizontally.

On levels two to four, you have two, four and six dragonflies, respectively, moving together just under the crabs. You get ten points for shooting the dragonflies but this makes them angry. They then drop one, two or three bombs (depending on the level). If you are next to a bomb when it explodes, your goose is cooked.

The game continues until you lose all you ducks.

It's all enough to make you quack up.</desc>
	<path>./Death Trap (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You have been sent to deliver a message. Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.

IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)

You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.

As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).

After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.

You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.

Game variations
After you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.

The difficulty settings are:
Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.
Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.
Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.

The difficulty switches are not used.
After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.

Scoring
Readiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.
Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.
Destroy the left or right generator=2000 points
Destroy the center generator=5000 points
Shield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than zero.</desc>
	<path>./Defender (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Defender put players in charge of a ship sent to protect mankind from wave after wave of attacking alien forces.

Armed with "smart bombs", and the ability to use hyperspace to move quickly around the planet, the player ship must fight against Bombers, Pods, Swarmers, Baiters, and Landers - that can capture the humanoids and transform them into deadly and relentless Mutants. Fail to save the humanoids from freefall or Mutant transformation, and the planet is destroyed.

Eugene Jarvis' Defender has been widely regarded as one of the most popular and addictive space shooters of the early 1980's</desc>
	<path>./Demolition Herby (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Wham! Bam! Watch out, ma'am!

You are Demolition Herby and you're out to own the roads. You must drive around a square section to black it out; the object being to black out all sections. There are only three things in your way: the chase cars. When they drive over a line you have turned red, it turns white again. To make matters worse, they will try to ram you off the track. The good news is if you ram them from behind, you run them off the track for a few seconds. If you need a burst of speed, shift into overdrive by pressing your button however, there is a drawback, as I will explain. Something else to keep an eye on is your fuel. You burn fuel as your drive and burn faster when you use overdrive. Each time you black out an section, you gain points and fuel. If you black out two sections at once, you gain more fuel. You will lose a life if you run out of fuel or are knocked off the track. If you lose three lives, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Demon Attack (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</desc>
	<path>./Demons to Diamonds (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Demons to Diamonds, you control a laser zapper which moves horizontally at either the top or the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting objects in the center of the screen. Wandering back and forth in the middle are demons which can be one of two colors. If you shoot a demon that is the same color as your zapper, it will turn into a diamond. Shooting the diamond before it disappears will earn you bonus points. If you shoot a demon of the opposite color, it will instead turn into a skull which will rapidly fire at your zapper. You begin the game with five zappers, and the game ends when all five have been destroyed by skulls. The game can be played by one or two players, and several game variations are included to set the level of difficulty.</desc>
	<path>./Desert Falcon (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Desert Falcon is an arcade style shooter. Many of the Pharaoh's great treasures are lost throughout the desert, and your goal is to steal as many as you can to earn points. The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</desc>
	<path>./Dice Puzzle (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>If you enjoy games like Rubik's Cube, then you'll like this one. The object of Dice Puzzle is to get all 16 dice to show the same number. You accomplish this by clicking on a column or row, which advances all of the numbers in that column or row by one (of course six advances to one). See how quickly (or in how many moves) you can do it.</desc>
	<path>./Dig Dug (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>
	<path>./Dodge 'Em (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You control a race car on a four lane track, and your goal is to collect all of the dots in order to earn points and advance to the next level! The race track is broken up into four quadrants; your racecar must remain in the lane it is in except where there is a break in the lanes between quadrants. Trying to stop you is a second car which travels in the opposite direction. This car will always be trying to get into the same lane as you, causing a crash, so you need to make sure you switch to any lane it isn't in! To help out, your racecar has the ability to travel at a fast or slow speed. You begin the game with three racecars, and the game ends when all three cars have crashed. A two player game variation is also available where one player controls a car trying to collect the dots, and the second player controls the crash car trying to stop the first player.</desc>
	<path>./Dolphin (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Dolphin is a side scrolling action game. You control a dolphin that is being chased by a giant sea squid. Your goal is to earn points by staying alive as long as possible. As you swim away from the squid, you will encounter schools of sea horses which form a vertical row on the screen with only a small opening to swim through. As you approach each school, the dolphins sonar will help you locate the opening; a low pitched sound will indicate the opening is near the bottom of the screen, and a higher pitched sound indicates the opening is near the top. If you miss the opening, the dolphin will lose speed allowing the squid to catch up to you! From time to time, a seagull may fly overhead; if you jump out of the water and touch the seagull, your dolphin will temporarily be able to chase the squid. Throughout the ocean are waves which are indicated by arrows; an arrow pointing the same direction you are travelling will boost the dolphins speed, whereas an arrow pointing the opposite direction slows you down. The longer you stay alive, the faster and trickier the squid will become! The game ends when all of your dolphins have been caught by the squid.</desc>
	<path>./Donald Duck's Speedboat (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc>Donald has entered the Duckburg boat race and has taken to the sea with his speedboat. The objective is to steer the boat away from the obstacles along the way to the finish line and do so as fast as possible without losing pressure on the throttle. The game takes place across multiple screens which each presents its own obstacle patterns and challenges.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong Junior (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa!

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong. In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage. As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.

Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior. Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes. The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.

Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.

In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot. Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.

Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</desc>
	<path>./Double Dragon (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.</desc>

	<desc>The king's treasures have been stolen! As the daring young prince, your goal is to recover them all. The treasures are being kept in various castles, each one guarded by a fire breathing dragon. Each level in the game has two parts; first you will need to cross the castle's drawbridge. You will have to jump and duck the dragons fireballs as well as avoid flying arrows to reach the other side! In the second part you need to collect all of the treasures on the screen and make it to the exit while avoiding the dragon who runs across the bottom of the screen. The dragons on each level have different patterns of movement and firing, and as the levels progress will become faster and trickier.</desc>
	<path>./Dragonstomper (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Long ago, a Druid magician created an amulet of great power that could subdue a dragon. Heading to the dragon's lair, the Druid accidentally dropped the amulet and it fell deep into its lair. Over time, the amulet imbued the dragon with cunning and power so that it began to spread treachery and evil about the peaceful Kingdom. The player's quest begins with the king summoning the player to defeat the dragon once and for all. Taking up the call to arms, the player begins by gathering their strength and fighting creatures in the enchanted countryside to build up enough power to become a Dragonstomper. When finally ready, the player moves on to an oppressed village near the dragon's lair in order to recruit soldiers, buy magical scrolls, and acquire medicines and elixirs needed to face the dragon in its lair. With all of his skills, training, equipment and soldiers, the Dragonstomper descends into the dragon's lair for a final combat to bring peace to the Kingdom.</desc>
	<path>./Dragster (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Dragster is a drag racing simulation for one or two players. The object of the game is to be the first car to race across the screen in the two player game, or to race across the screen in the shortest possible time in a one player game. The joystick acts as both the gas peddle and clutch; you have the ability to shift from first through fourth, but be careful not to shift too soon because you can't downshift! You must also be careful not to rev your engine too much, or you'll blow your engine and be out of the race. There are two game variations included; in the simpler game, you just need to drive straight to reach the goal. In the advanced variation, you also have the ability to steer and need to keep your car driving straight between the bleachers and road divider.</desc>

Atari advertised Dumbo in European Atari catalogs and even had a prototype box made, so the decision to shelve it must have been made quite late.  Even though Dumbo was developed as a children's game, the gameplay is quite difficult which may be the reason why it was never released.</desc>

	<desc>E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is a licensed adventure game, based on the movie. The adventure takes place on several screens with pits scattered about. The object of the game is to find pieces of E.T.'s phone. Once all pieces are found, E.T. calls home and the spaceship arrives to pick him up. E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces scattered around in order to regain energy which is constantly depleted with time. 

The phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving. 

Evil scientists and agents wander around the area, trying to capture E.T. and steal the parts he's carrying.</desc>

	<path>./Eli's Ladder (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This game was designed to help teach children addition, subtraction and counting. Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.

The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.

The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.

There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.</desc>

	<desc>Ow! Your head hurts. Where are you? What happened? It is dark but you here a beeping and find a PDA at your feet. You note there is a dot on the PDA screen. When you take a step, it move, too.  Interesting. There is a button and stick. When you press the button, you see the walls of part of a maze. Moving the stick lets you look at more maze. All very well but you note that there is a timer counting down. You have a suspicion that when it ends, so will you.

You begin in a maze on the lower left corner. You can move anywhere but cannot pass through walls or the outer perimeter. If you press fire, you can see a spotlighted area of the maze and by holding down the button, you can move the joystick around to see more maze. You must find the exit before the timer, which begins counting down as soon as you move, reaches zero. In the maze, there is a box that will give you more time. If the timer reaches zero, game is over. Once you exit the maze, you get any remaining time as your score. If you never used the spotlight in that maze, your score is doubled.</desc>
	<path>./Encounter at L-5 (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Using an anti-matter launcher, you must defend the starbase L5 against a non-stop horde of blue Megalyte warrior ships and their death ships. As the warriors reach the bottom, they fire on your base. It does not hurt the base but would lose you one of your four lives. Sometimes the death ship takes a dive towards your base, firing as it goes. If it reaches your base, it will destroy your generator, losing you a life.

As hordes of Megalye ships descend, you can hold down the fire button. This will keep the anti-matter launcher in place and moving the paddle will shift the cursor and thus your aim. If you are in danger of being shot or need to destroy a death ship, just release the button and then you can move the launcher left or right.

There are 26 game variations. The odd numbered ones are one player, the even numbered are two player.

Scoring
You score ten points for each death ship you destroy
Your points vary for the warrior ships. The farther from you they are, the more the points.</desc>

	<desc>Enduro is an action racing game similar to Pole Position. Your goal is to last as long as you can in an enduro race; each day of the race you are required to pass a certain number of cars. If you succeed, you get to continue on, fail and you are out of the race. The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by; not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts of light, but the seasons can change as well. Snow, ice, and fog will occasionally appear to make driving more treacherous. With each day that passes, the other cars will become faster and more aggressive. At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.</desc>

	<path>./Entombed (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>What started out as a nice little archaeological expedition has suddenly become a nightmarish fight for survival! A team of archaeologists is trapped in an underground maze of dark, winding tunnels. All around them, fearsome zombies are emerging from the crypts. The archaeologists' only hope of survival (apart from some very fast running) is an ancient device known as the 'make-break', which can be used to either create or destroy pieces of wall.

In this increasingly frantic one or two-player arcade game, you'll need wits as well as dexterity. You'll have to think on the fly, plan strategically and race through the maze as fast as you can. Fail to keep up the pace and you're zombie fodder. Good luck!</desc>
	<path>./Escape from the Mindmaster (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You've been abducted! Kidnapped! Shanghaied! You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes.

You begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.

There are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:
Maze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.
Maze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow
Maze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence
Maze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once
Maze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five attempts.

You start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.

	<path>./Exocet (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>You are a UFO. You must shoot tall and short towers above ground. You can shoot the short ones on any part of them but the tall ones must be shot at the firing spot. To shoot, you move in the direction you want to shoot, the press fire. You have to do this every time you shoot.

After you destroy ten towers, a tunnel will open so you can get underground. You will have three chances to get underground. If you choose to remain above ground, the firing rate of the enemies doubles.

Underground, the tunnel narrows after a time. If, after you hit ten towers underground, the firing speed doubles.

Points:
Hitting a tall above ground tower=50 points
Hitting a short above ground tower=20 points
Hitting an underground tower=50 to 360 points
Getting through tunnel safely without hitting a tower=20 points

After a certain amount of towers are hit, the ground turns from green to blue. When this happens, if you hit ten towers, you get an extra man. You can only have a maximum of eight extra men.</desc>

	<path>./Fantastic Voyage (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Fantastic Voyage is a vertically scrolling shooter for one player. The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.</desc>

	<path>./Final Approach (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are an air traffic controller at an international airport. You must guide planes in to landing safely.

Your first screen is the Approach Control Radar screen or ARC. You must guide the aircraft , using the cursor, until they are headed left to right along the yellow line headed towards the black stripe. Make sure the other planes are headed where they won't immediately head towards each other or off screen.

After the plane gets near the black stripe, move the cursor to the center red light and press the button. You will then be on the Ground Control Approach screen or GCA. Here you must center the plane's nose on the glide slope and localizer before it arrives at the end of the runway. If the landing is successful, the plane will disappear from the ARC screen and a new one will appear soon to take its place. If not, when you press your joystick button and return to the ARC screen, the plane will still be there. If a plane starts flashing on the ARC and you hear an emergency sound, this plane has an emergency and must be landed first.

Scoring
Successful landing=25 points
Successful emergency landing if landing before other planes=50 points
Aircraft wanders off radar=lose 5 points

You get a control error (lose a life) if you allow a near miss or do not immediately land an aircraft in distress. You are allowed an additional control error (extra life) every 500 points.

	<desc>A local warehouse has caught fire, and you're the fire fighter who has to come to the rescue! Your goal is to save the worker who is trapped in the warehouse; on the right side of the screen is a firetruck with an adjustable ladder. You can move the ladder to the appropriate floor of the building to climb up and rescue the trapped worker. Depending on which floors have caught fire, the worker will move to the lowest floor he can which isn't burning; you'll need to estimate which floor he'll be on when you position the ladder. Once the worker is safe, you move on to the next (more challenging) level. The fire in the building may spread quickly! If necessary, you can use a fire hose to put out the fire. Of course, you have a limited supply of water so make sure you don't run out! As the levels progress, the building becomes shorter and the fire spreads faster which means you don't have as much time in which to rescue the trapped victims.</desc>

	<path>./Flag Capture (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Flag Capture is an action/strategy game for one or two players. Your goal is to locate a flag hidden somewhere on a 9x7 grid. Using the joystick you can move your explorer around the grid; on any square you can press the button to see if the flag is located in that square, or if not to receive a clue as to the flags location. If the square doesn't contain the flag, one of several items may appear: an arrow indicating what direction the flag is, a number indicating how many squares away the flag is, or a bomb which will cause you to have to start again. In the one player game your goal is to locate as many flags as possible in the 75 second time limit. There are several varieties of two players games: in free-for-all, both players can move around the grid simultaneously and whomever finds the flag first scores a point. In the other two player games, players take turns moving around the grid. Several skill levels are available which control the players moving speed, allow the flag to be stationary or move, or add an invisible wall around the playfield.</desc>

	<path>./Flash Gordon (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are Flash Gordon. Many spacemen have entered Spider City but never returned. Your job, Flash, is two fold. Rescue any spacemen you find in the tunnels of Spider City and destroy all the hatching pods.

The lower part of the screen is a map. You are the horizontal line, the hatching pods are the vertical lines and the Disrupters are the crosses. The upper part of the screen is the close-up of the action.

You rescue spacemen by touching them with your ship. You destroy hatching pods, and the spider warriors that hatch, by flying to the pods then shooting the warriors.

You can also shoot generators, patrol ships and debris. Shooting the generator will keep the Disrupter from moving about the city for a little bit but the debris never stops while you are within, so don't hang out in the Disrupter.

If you destroy five warriors at one hatching pod or your ship is destroyed when it returns, you will have a shield for a short time. There will be two beeps to warn you of the shield leaving.

The scoring is as follows:
10 points = Debris
25 points = Patrol Ship
70 points = Rescued Spaceman
100 points = Disrupter Generator

You get 100 points for killing the first warrior at a pod, 200 for the second, 300 for the third and so on.

You lose 1,000 points if you shoot a spaceman, but Flash Gordon would never do that, right?

Every time you conquer a city, you get an extra man.</desc>
	<path>./Football (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Football is a football game for two players. The game is played from a top down point of view of the field and features two skill levels and three game variations. Using the joystick you can choose from one of five different offensive or defensive plays. In the first game variation, after selecting a play you then control the players on the field. In the second game, you have the option of controller your players after a play is selected or allowing the computer to control the players. The third game has the computer controlling the players at all times and you only need to select the plays you wish it to execute  and indicate when you wish to punt or pass the ball. In all of the game variations the timer begins at 5 minutes, and is active only during plays. Of course, the team with the most points when the timer runs out wins!</desc>

You must make your way two screens to the right to get to your tree. Animals will come at you from either side of the screen. You must either jump over the animal or press your button and push the joystick in the desired direction to chop them with your axe. Snakes cannot be chopped, only jumped over. 

Also to contend with is a bird in the air that is dropping stones. If you are hit by a stone, you will be unable to move for two seconds, which could prove fatal. Once you reach the tree, you must chop it down while still avoiding the animals. It takes four chops per side to fell the tree. If you need to, you can climb the tree to avoid animals. Once the tree is chopped, the game restarts at a faster level. You have only one life so if an animal touches you, it is game over.</desc>

Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.

You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.

The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</desc>
	<path>./Gamma-Attack (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are the commander of the only Gamma ship in this stellar field.  The Vegan war fleet has taken control of your Gamma outpost planet and is defending it with Vegan laser pulse tanks.  This planet is the only inhabitable planet in this star system, and you must stay there and fight the Vegans as long as you can.

Move your ship across the surface of the planet and destroy Vegan tanks that you encounter. Destroying all tanks advances the player to the next level. Each laser pulse that your Gamma ship receives reduces your hovering altitude. When your ship crashes, the "Gammy" appears and your game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Gangster Alley (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>S.B.I. (Spectravision Bureau of Investigation) file on Chicago Joe and his gang:
We apprehended Chicago Joe but in retaliation, his gang have holed up in an apartment building, taking hostage a dame and her kid. The following men have been positively identified:

Shifty
2. Scar Face
3. Mugsy
4. Lefty
5. Nitro Ed

Your orders are to snipe any gang member. DO NOT SHOOT AN INNOCENT! Watch out for Nitro Ed. He likes to play with hand grenades. One of those and you're pushing up daisies. Good luck.

You move the joystick to aim at a gangster and push the button to fire. Your ammo is limited so don't fire randomly. Occasionally, Nitro Ed, on the roof, will hold up a grenade. You must shoot him to disarm him. You get money for each gangster shot. The values for level one are:

1. Mugsy=$20
2. Scare Face=$30
3. Lefty=$40
4. Shifty=$50
5. Disarming Nitro Ed=$100

These amounts increase for each level by $10. You also get $10 for each bullet you have left after each level. There are six levels. The fourth level is a nighttime level. In this level, you must fire one bullet to light up the windows. If you do not fire for a couple seconds, they go dark again.
If you shoot an innocent, you will lose $1000 or you total amount if you have less than $1000.

If a gangster rises all the way out of a window, after a couple of seconds, he will shoot you and you will lose one bullet proof vest (life). After you lose all your vests, the game is over and Nitro Ed will laugh at you. If Nitro Ed gets off his hand grenade, no matter how many vests you have, the game is over. And Nitro Ed will laugh at you. You start with four vests and can earn another at $5000.</desc>

	<path>./Gas Hog (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are in your vehicle which has terrible fuel efficiency. A real gas hog. You are trying to travel along but there is one or more ships above you that are trying to bomb you. To make things worse, there are holes in the road and other ships you need to shoot so as to not ram them.

As you go along, you can accelerate or decelerate to avoid being bombed but be careful because you might ram some ships near the ground. You can jump to avoid them or blast them for points. You will also see numbers along your way. Run into them to acquire their point value. Do not shoot them or their value will be deducted from you score.

As this is Gas Hog, you will soon run low on fuel. You must get below ground via the occasional holes, to grab a refuel marker. Do not stay below ground, however, as you travel in the wrong direction while there. You start with four lives and lose one if you are hit by a bomb or ship or run out of fuel.</desc>
	<path>./Gauntlet (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This game has nothing to do with the Atari arcade game or any of the home-ported versions.

You are the great explorer, Sir Robert Wittenbottom. You have discovered an ancient civilization deep within the forest of a mysterious island. Since you're a likable old fellow, they have decided to induct you into their council of warriors. But first you must prove your worthiness by running the gauntlet.

You are given three glasses of water. You must run through the gauntlet to the ceremonial fires and use your water to put them out. You current glass of water will then be refilled then it is off to the next fire.

Of course, it is not that easy. You must jump over rocks and logs, duck under stones, arrows and tomahawks, and avoid hitting trees or touching the sides of the gauntlet.You can ease the thirst of the old men you come across for points but it will cost you water. The game is over when you run out of your third glass of water. To jump, just press the fire button. To duck, pull back then press the fire button.

Scoring:
Jump over a rock or a log=50 points
Duck under an arrow, stone or tomahawk=100 points
Give an old man a drink of water=250 points
Duck under the Secret Talisman=500 points
Extinguish the ceremonial flame=500 points

	<path>./Ghost Manor (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Your friend is trapped inside Ghost Manor! There are five different screens you need to get past before you can rescue your friend from the top floor of the manor. The game begins in the graveyard outside the manor; here you play tag with a friendly rainbow ghost or skeleton which will supply you with spears you can fire at enemies. In the second screen, you approach the guarded entrance of the manor. Using the spears you collected, you need to shoot all of the enemies blocking the entrance. The third and fourth screens take place inside the manor; each floor has a set of stairs as well as several treasures and crosses which can be collected. There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>
	<path>./Ghostbusters (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

	<path>./Glib - Video Word Game (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600.

The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.

Difficulty switches
Use the left switch to set the number of players; B for one player, A for two.

Game variations
There are five games, each with five skill levels.
The skill levels differ by the amount of time you have to make words.
Skill levels for one player games:
Skill level 1=unlimited time (no clock)
Skill level 2=132 seconds
Skill level 3=39 seconds
Skill level 4=26 seconds
Skill level 5=random times
For two player games, the times are half of what they are in one player.

The games are:
Game 1 (Billboard): After each round, all the letters are reshuffled, so you get a whole new set of seven letters. Any letters that were not used go back into the mix.
Game 2 (Skill Builder): Only the letters you used to make the word are replaced. Any unused letters stay on the top spaces.
Game 3 (Times Up): You are given seven letters only. You must use these seven to make as many words as you can.
Game 4 (Encore): The letters on the top row all shift to the right, with the last letter disappearing and a new letter plopping into the first spot. You must grab you letters and place them quickly. Any letters the you don't use will reappear randomly again.
Game 5 (Over the Edge): Same as game 4 but letters that disappear never return.</desc>

	<path>./Golf (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Golf features a nine hole, par 36 course which can be played by one or two players. The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.</desc>
	<path>./Gopher (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>A pesky gopher is after your carrot patch! Your goal is to stop it before all of your carrots are gone. The gopher will be tunneling in the ground at the bottom of the screen; you are at the top and need to fill in the gophers tunnels with your shovel. The gopher is fast, however, and if you don't fill in the tunnels quick enough it will make it to the surface and run off with one of your carrots! If the gopher manages to take all of your carrots, the game will be over. From time to time there will be a duck that flies overhead. As the duck passes by, it will drop a seed; if you catch the seed and plant it, a new carrot will grow to replace one of the ones that was stolen. Several difficulty levels are included, which control the speed and intelligence of the gopher, and whether or not the duck will appear.</desc>
	<path>./Gorf (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Gorf is a game similar to Space Invaders, alien vessels approach closer and closer in their threatening row formation.

The game itself consists of four levels:

1. The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship &amp; shield on one side and the aliens on the other side;

The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;

The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading "towards" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;

The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.

Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.</desc>
	<path>./GoSub (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>You are a submarine driver in search of sunken treasure off the coast of Cape Chammawingiwakauguflidplitargoknotz. Your job: Get the treasure chests and be rich! But there are dangers: it seems the treasures are well protected by walls and a pesky octopus. Go luck and be careful, Captain.

You pilot your sub through a maze, avoiding touching the deadly walls. Your goal is to reach the treasure chest at the end of the maze. Don't let the octopus completely cover your sub or you will die. Be aware that the octopus will slow you down so be prepared for a burst of speed once you are past.

The two player game, dubbed GoSub 500 by the creators, is a counter-clockwise race around an oval track. First to cross the finish line wins.</desc>
	<path>./Grand Prix (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Grand Prix is an action racing game for one player. The game is played with an overhead view of the racetrack which scrolls horizontally. Your goal is to reach the finish line in the shortest possible time on one of the four different tracks included. Of course, there will be obstacles on the tracks which will slow you down if you're not careful. Numerous other cars will often get in your way, oil slicks will cause you to temporarily lose control, and on the more difficulty tracks narrow bridges will cause you to come to a complete stop if you miss the path.</desc>
	<path>./Gravitar (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.</desc>
	<path>./Gremlins (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This game is based on the Steven Spielberg movie of the same name but is different than the other versions.

In this version, on the first screen, Mogwai are jumping from the roof to get at hamburgers on the ground. You, as Billy, must catch them before the hit the ground. If you get them all, it is off to the next, faster, level. If you miss eight, then you go to a shooting screen.

On the shooting screen, gremlins are approaching from the distance. You must shoot them before they reach you. If one reaches you, you lose a life. After they are all dead, it is back to the first screen at a faster level. In later levels, puddles of water will divide the gremlins in two.</desc>

	<desc>Guardian is an arcade action game for one or two players. In an intergalactic war, an enemy ship called Dromeda is attacking your home planets and you need to defend them! The planets are located at either the top or the bottom of the screen, and are defended by a shield. Dromeda is in the middle of the screen, and will be launching explosive devices at the planets. You control a spaceship which is the last hope to save the planets. Unfortunately, your ships lasers are unable to reach Dromeda, so you you must shoot the explosives as they come in. If you miss any explosives, they will destroy part of the shield. If a large enough hole forms, an explosive could get through and destroy an entire planet. The game ends when all of your planets have been destroyed.</desc>
	<path>./Gunfight (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>This game is inspired by the 1975 Midway coin-op game, Gun Fight.

There are four game versions:
In Standard Duel, the first player to score seven hits on their opponent, wins.
In Six-shooter Duel, the first player to score seven hits on their opponent, wins however, after six shots, you must grab the flashing spot on your side of the screen to reload.
In Escape Scenario, the player on the right is trying to escape and must last ninety-nine time units. The player on the left just needs to shoot the player on the right one time to win. The player on the right CAN shoot the player on the left and this will buy him a little time.
In Target Scenario, there will be a target in the middle of the screen. Each hit of the target is one point. Each hit of the opposing player is five points. The first player to seventy-seven points, wins.</desc>
	<path>./Gyruss (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The entire solar system is being attacked by the vicious Gyrusians, and it's up to you to save the day! You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</desc>
	<path>./H.E.R.O. (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

	<desc>Protect the children and fight for your life "the night HE came home!"

Babysitting a group of children in a large two-story house, players assume the role of Laurie Strode as psychopath Michael Myers has escaped from the mental institution and has come back for revenge. Players must guide the children to safe rooms while avoiding Michael Myers and his knife.

The house is large and full of dangerous blackouts and dead-ends within its sixteen rooms. However, Laurie is not completely defenseless. There is a knife that can be found to protect herself once the familiar theme music begins to play and killer remains in pursuit. 

Players will advance to the next level by either stabbing Michael Myers twice, or rescuing five of the children.</desc>

	<desc>Hangman is an electronic version of the game hangman! Your goal is to figure out a word that the computer has generated by guessing one letter at a time. Guess a correct letter, and it will appear on the screen in the proper location, but if you guess a letter that isn't in the word then you are one step closer to being hung. Guess eleven incorrect letters, and the game is over. A point is earned each time a word is completed. Several difficulty settings are included which affect the number of letters in the words. The game can be played by one or two players, and in the two player version the words can optionally be created by one of the players instead of the computer.</desc>

	<path>./Haunted House (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the  four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.

The mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!

You are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn, you will need to put down the scepter so be careful! You win the game when all three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the better the score!</desc>
	<path>./Holey Moley (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc>It's video Whack-A-Mole!

Each round consists of twenty-five moles. When a mole pops out of his hole, press the corresponding button on the Kid's Controller to whack it. The faster you hit him, the more points you'll get. If the King Mole pops up, whack him for even higher points. Beware of the acorn. If it pops up, don't whack it as it will cost you points. You must score at least three hundred points by the time the mole count reaches zero. If you reach or exceed three hundred points in one round, any points beyond three hundred will be added to your score as a bonus. If you fail to score three hundred points in one round, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Home Run (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base. 

The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</desc>
	<path>./Human Cannonball (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land in a bucket of water. To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.</desc>

	<desc>A 4k game (three more than its predecessor!), Hunchy 2 boasts more bells and whistles (admittedly more bells than whistles) than the game it is nominally a successor to, the Atari 2600's Hunchy, and though superficially drawing thematic inspiration from Hunchback II: Quasimodo's Revenge, its basic gameplay has been more directly derived from Chuckie Egg and Miner 2049er.

The gameplay in question involves a progression through 14 levels 
of platforming to impress Esmeralda, climbing up and down ladders to gather bells while avoiding guards and a regular stream of missiles being fired in from the sides.

	<path>./Hunt &amp; Score (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Hunt &amp; Score is similar to the game Memory. The player is presented with a numbered grid; behind each grid section is a picture. On each turn, the player chooses two grid sections in an attempt to find two matching pictures. Points are earned for finding matching pictures, and the player with the most points at the end wins.

At any given time one player is active and can be controlled while the other remains inactive; if the puck is near your goal then the defensive player becomes active, otherwise you control the offensive player. Each player has the ability to shoot the puck at a variety of angles, and can even body check their opponent! The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player more of an advantage.</desc>

In the two player game, the first player to complete 25 laps wins! Included are several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and additional game variations called ice race, tag, and crash 'n score. In ice race, the track is icy causing your car to slide often and making it difficulty to steer.  In tag, one player is "it" and needs to tag the other player. For each second you race without being tagged, a point is earned. Lastly, in crash 'n score the goal is to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the track.</desc>

You move the joystick to move your character, left or right. Press the button to fire. You fire in the direction you are moving. When you are next to an elevator, you will automatically board it when it gets to your level unless your are pushing towards it, in which case you will walk across it. 

If you are on the same level with an assassin and there is no elevator between you, you can shoot him. If he shoots at you, you can pull down on the joystick to duck. You cannot shoot while ducked. If the assassin shoots or touches you, you lose a life.

Difficulty switch
A=Enemy shots travel the length of the screen
B=Enemy shots only travel half the screen's length

Scoring
Agent travels all floor levels, top to bottom or bottom to top=3,000 points
Shooting an assassin=250 points
Assassin is riding elevator when shot=75 bonus points added to assassin shooting points

You get an extra agent every 10,000 points.

	<desc>In James Bond 007 you control James Bond in his multi purpose craft. This craft can travel on both land and sea, can jump over danger, or fire at enemies on the many different levels. Each horizontally scrolling level in the game is loosely based on a different James Bond movie. The levels included are Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only. Each level has a variety of enemies trying to destroy you, and a unique goal that must be accomplished to continue on (for example, you may have to land on a hidden oil rig to stop Seraffino, or find Stromberg's undersea laboratory and destroy it). If you can complete all the missions, you win the game! Good luck, Mr. Bond.</desc>

	<path>./Journey Escape (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You're on the road with the rock band Journey! After each concert, your goal is to guide the five band members to the escape vehicle so they can get to the next concert on time. You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</desc>
	<path>./Joust (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>
	<path>./JoustPong (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>This is a variation on the classic game Pong that adds flapping wings to your paddles. You must press your flap button repeatedly to go up and stop pressing to come down.

In the Atari 2600 version, there is also a pterodactyl on the screen the interferes with the ball or your paddle. The Atari 2600 version also includes a variation referred to as 'Poorlords' that adds a wall of bricks behind the players that must be busted through to score points.</desc>
	<path>./Jr. Pac-Man (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Jr. Pac-Man features gameplay similar to the original Pac-Man, but with a few changes. As Jr., you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.</desc>

	<path>./Jungle Hunt (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty once all four have been survived.  If you don't survive these adventures, you will not only lose your own life but that of the lovely Penelope, who has been captured by cannibals!

The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines without plummeting to your doom? The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river. Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with. Don't forget to go up for air! In the third part, you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics. Once you've cleared all these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked spear. Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?

Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile phase). The view is always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.</desc>

	<desc>Kabobber was originally a prototype game that was programmed by Rex Bradford, known for his work on Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Jedi Arena. It was discovered in 2000 and improved upon a little before being released to the public in ROM format. Kabobbers are strange (but cute) little creatures who just love wreaking havoc. Your objective is to send in your Buvskies to krush the Kabobbers before they krush you. You can have up to nine Buvskies onscreen at one time, but you have reserves waiting offscreen should one get krushed. You move your Bruvskies across the grid, jumping on enemy Kabobbers in order to defeat them and earn additional reserve Bruvskies. The baby Bruvskies become big ones when they defeat an enemy. The enemies get tougher and tougher, meaning very good timing is required in the later stages. Above all, you must reach Princess Buvsky before she reaches the rainbow energy at the other end of the level and devours it. A very unique game, but also somewhat fun.</desc>
	<path>./Kaboom! (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The mad bomber is on the loose! As he races back and forth at the top  of the screen, you need to catch the bombs he drops in buckets of water. One point is earned for each bomb caught, but miss one of the bombs, and Kaboom! As the levels progress, the mad bomber will move faster and faster and drop more and more bombs. You start the game with three buckets, and lose one each time a bomb is missed. The game ends when all of your water buckets are gone.</desc>

You need to guide the kangaroo up the various ladders and platforms to the top where Baby Roo is being held captive. The monkeys will be trying to stop you by throwing or dropping apples and knocking you off the platforms. Your kangaroo has boxing gloves, however, and can knock out the monkeys with a single punch! Along the way various types of fruit can be collected to earn bonus points.</desc>
	<path>./Karate (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Karate is a fighting game for two players or one player against the computer. Your goal is to earn a black belt by winning a series of fights. By moving the joystick in various directions and pushing the button, you can use a variety of kicks and punches which are each worth varying amounts of points if successful. Each fight lasts for two minutes, and at the end of that time the points earned will be added up to determine who the winner is. There are two difficulty levels available.</desc>
	<path>./Keystone Kapers (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</desc>
	<path>./Killer Satellites (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>For decades, the weapons satellites have orbited Earth harmlessly. Now, for unknown reasons, they have dropped from the sky to obliterate mankind. You are a test pilot with an experimental craft that can stop the satellites. It is up to you to protect your home town.

You fly above your town's forcefield. Satellites will drop from the sky and show on the radar area at the screen top. You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the ability to penetrate the town's shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town's shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram into one.</desc>
	<path>./King Kong (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>King Kong has taken a lady to the top of the Empire State Building. It is up to you to rescue her but it won't be easy. Kong is throwing bombs at you.

This game is a clone of Donkey Kong, except instead of barrels, you must avoid bombs. You must make your way across the floors and up the ladders while jumping over bombs for points and holes in the floor. There is also a timer in the upper right. It starts at nine-hundred ninety and counts down ten points per second. If you are hit by a bomb or fall through a hole in the floor or the time reaches zero, you lose a life. Occasionally, Kong will release a magic bomb that gives more points when you jump it as well as moves you to the next floor up. Once you reach the top floor, the game starts again but faster.</desc>

	<desc>When the troublemaking Thirsties enact their plan of draining water out of the local swimming pool with their drinking straws, it's up to Kool-Aid Man to stop them!

Kool-Aid man must gather up Kool-Aid soft drink mix in order to catch and put a stop to the Thirsties' scheme. The three ingredients are Water (W), Sugar (S), and Kool-Aid (K). If the Thirsties touch Kool-Aid Man, he gets bounced around the yard, losing time, and the pool gets drained further. 

If the Thirsties succeed in draining the pool, it's "Game Over" for Kool-Aid Man. If Kool-Aid Man succeeds, then he wins and goes on to the next level of difficulty. Oh Yeah!</desc>
	<path>./Krull (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Krull is a multi part action game based on the movie of the same name. A beast and his army have traveled through space until finally landing on the distant planet of Krull and ravaging the entire planet. But there is a prophecy which tells of a king and queen who will someday take back the planet. These future rulers are Princess Lyssa and Prince Colwyn. But before their marrage, Princess Lyssa is captured by the beast! 

You play the part of Prince Colwyn on a mission to rescue Lyssa and destroy the beast. The game is divided up into several parts.

The first part takes place during the foiled wedding. A large number of slayers arrive at the castle, and you need to defeat as many as you can to earn points. But eventually Princess Lyssa is captured.

In the next section you need to ride your horse towards the Widow's web; on the way you can collect Glaives which may be used to fight the beast. Once you reach the web, you need to make your way to the cocoon at the top of the web in order to find the correct path to the Black Fortress. The crystal spider along with strands of the web make maneuvering your way around this screen a challenge. Once you know the correct path, you ride on to the Black Fortress. 

Here you need to use the Glaives you've collected to free the Princess from a prison, and then destroy the beast! After successfully completing all tasks, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>
	<path>./Kung-Fu Master (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>A conversion of the arcade game of the same name, which itself is loosely based on a movie, Kung-Fu Master is a side scrolling action game for one or two players, who alternate turns.

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.</desc>
	<path>./Lady Bug (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>An action game in the same style as Pac-Man but very very different. Players control a ladybug who must venture around different mazes collecting all of the food pellet "x"'s. In addition to there being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game.  In the center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned every time the border around the screen makes a complete "lap". Timers for the border vary upon the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.

In addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses. However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to that colour's word. The red word is "SPECIAL" and the yellow word is "EXTRA". Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus round.

Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the X's being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player dies, but letter powerups are not.</desc>

But be careful, they are fully armed with their own lasers and have no intention of letting you take them out easily! The more enemy vehicles you destroy, the more points you earn. If you do get hit by a laser blast, your spacecraft will fall to the ground and crash. When hit you still have one last chance to take out an enemy by maneuvering the spacecraft to crash land on top of it.</desc>
	<path>./Laser Gates (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Laser Gates is a side scrolling shooter. Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the force fields.</desc>

As you collect diamonds you need to bring them back to the shark cage in order to earn points. Swimming back and forth constantly is a deadly shark. If the shark encounters any of the diamonds, it will eat them; likewise you can also be eaten by the shark, causing you to lose a life. You have no defense against the shark, however you are immune if you are in the shark cage and the doors are closed. Somewhere in the maze the Loch Ness monster remains hidden. If you disturb the monster, it will continuously chase you unless you can lead it back into one of the caves located in the corners of the screen.</desc>
	<path>./Lock 'n' Chase (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Lock 'n' Chase is an arcade action game similar to Pac-Man. You play a thief who is trapped in a maze like vault. To get out, you need to collect all of the gold dots located in the maze. Your task won't be easy, since there are four police officers in the vault who are constantly trying to catch you! Located throughout the maze are numerous doors. As you run through the maze, you have the ability to temporarily close a door in an attempt to block the police. You can only close two doors at a time, and any closed doors automatically open again after a short amount of time. When all of the gold in the maze has been collected, the exit to the vault will open and you can escape and move on to the next, more difficult vault. Occasionally a bonus item will appear in the maze, such as a cash bag, crown, or briefcase, which can be collected to earn even more points.</desc>
	<path>./London Blitz (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>During WWII German bombers turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Most bombs exploded on impact but some would sit for hours, days or weeks before detonating. It was up to the Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXB's) before they exploded. As a Lance Corporal in the Royal Engineers, it is your job to defuse these bombs.

First, you will check your London map to see where the bombs are. Then it is defusing time. 

On the C64, you must use the joystick to cause the dial to rotate, changing the numbers next to a switch then clicking on the disarm switch at the bottom. If the number is wrong, you must change it again and keep trying. 

On the Atari 2600, you slide a sliding bar. On green bombs, the top bar controls the left switch, the middle the middle and the bottom the right.You set the slide to a spot the move to the switches and push right. On orange bombs, what slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb and on blue bombs, you can't control the switches. They just randomly change and you push right and hope you disarm in time.

The possible ranks are:
Lance Corporal
Corporal
Sargent
Staff Sargent
Warrant Officer
Second Lieutenant
First Lieutenant
Captain

At the start of the game, you can select which rank to start at, from Lance Corporal to Second Lieutenant on the C64 or from Lance Corporal to First Lieutenant on the Atari 2600.

Every time you disarm a bomb, you move up levels within your rank. Move up eight levels and you are promoted. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage, you are demoted a level in rank.

You lose the game is you are demoted below Lance Corporal or a bomb explodes while you are near it, a not-very-healthy thing to happen.

You win if you get promoted to Captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.</desc>

You need to catch all of the luggage that is tossed out, or all of your clothes will be scattered around the airport. As the levels progress, more and more luggage will need to be caught, and the games speed increases. There are two difficulty levels available; the easier mode gives you two men to catch luggage with, and the harder mode gives you only one man. Several other game variations are also available: if the terrorist suitcase option is enabled, explosive suitcases will occasionally appear. If you don't catch these, the game immediately ends regardless of how many lives you have left. If the suitcase control option is enabled during a two player game, you are able to control the direction your opponents suitcases travel.</desc>

	<desc>M.A.D. (which stands for Missile Attack and Defense) is an arcade action game somewhat similar to Missile Command. You control a photon cannon at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to protect six energy stations located to your left and right. Waves of rockets and other ships will fly by on the screen, and occasionally one will drop in an attempt to destroy one of the stations (as a warning on most levels, the enemy will turn white just before it drops). You need to make sure you shoot it before your energy station is destroyed! When all six energy stations are gone, the game is over. A two player variation is also included; one player will control the photon cannon, and the second player controls a cursor and can select when and where an enemy will drop. The players alternate between offense and defense in this version.</desc>
	<path>./M.A.S.H (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>M*A*S*H was one of the many attempts by various software companies to take a successful movie or television show and convert it into a playable game.

In this game, you play the role of "Hawkeye Pierce," a surgeon stationed at the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital #4077 during the Korean War (1950-1953). There are two main stages in the game, each of which you must pass to move to the next round. The first mission involves rescuing injured soldiers from the battlefield with your helicopter and returning them to home base without being shot down by enemy tanks. The second mission takes place in the operating room while you are required to carefully remove bullets and shrapnel from wounded soldiers... it is very similar to the classic "OPERATION" tweezers game by Milton Bradley.

Each set of missions are repeated four times. The first player to reach 999 points wins the game. There are four different variations of games, each selectable as either one player (against the computer) or two-player mode.</desc>

	<desc>You are Commander Harrington "Harry" Crag of the starship "Endless Search". You are put into a Malagai base for repairs but now the Malagai are holding you ransom. They want your advanced technology.

There are three airlock doors per starbase. You must get the correct key for each door. Each is held by one of three Malagai. The order of which Malagai is holding which key is shown by the pictures above the starbase.

If you are away from your assigned compartment for too long, as indicated by the line at the bottom of the screen, the Malagai will attack and you will need to return to your compartment to make them friendly again. When you touch a Malagai and, if it is the correct one, get the airlock door key, the Malagai will attack and the airlock will flash, on most game variations (see below). You must then make your way to the airlock. One door will disappear and the Malagai will become friendly again. After you open the third door, it is off to the next starbase.

After the third (blue) starbase, you get an extra man.

Game Variations:
Version 1: All the Malagai have different shapes and colors
Version 2: All the Malagai have the same shape but different colors
Version 3: All Malagai are the same shape and color and the airlocks do not blink to show you got the right key.

Scoring:
Touch a Malagai while they're friendly=100 points (50 point bonus if it has the correct key)
Open airlocks one or two=100 points
Open airlock three to exit starbase orange or teal=150 points
Open airlock three to exit blue starbase=250 points

You have four lives. If you eat more than 20 plates of pasta, you will burst (literally) and lose 1 life. If more than 9 plates of pasta are placed on the table, it will collapse and you will lose 1 life.

To eat pasta, you move the joystick to the right then the left. To toss pasta to a pet, you move the joystick to the right then up or down in one smooth motion. You must throw when Mama's back is turned and the cat is in the window or the dog is in the right spot under the table. If you throw food at the floor or window when the pet is not in position or if Mama sees you throw food to a pet, she will bring 3 plates the next time. Remember, over nine plates on the table and it is arrivederci una vita (goodbye one life).

To clear a level, you must eat or toss a certain number of plates of pasta.
1=31
2=32
3=35
4=37
5=40
6=42
7=45
8=47
9=49

The point value of each plate of pasta starts at 5 at level 1 and increases by 1 point per level, to a maximum of 13 at level 9.
You get an extra life at every 1,000 points. The highest points you can reach is 9,999.</desc>

Millipede is the sequel to Centipede, and features similar gameplay, but with a new swarm of insects! The goal is to destroy the multi-segmented millipede as it traverses its way through the mushroom forest towards the bottom of the screen. When all millipede segments have been destroyed, the player will progress to the next, more difficult level. Millipedes and other creatures are all worth a different amount of points. Occasionally dynamite will appear on the screen, which will explode if shot by the bug zapper.

	<path>./Miner 2049er Volume II (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Bounty Bob has tracked Yukon Yohan into Nuclear Ned's uranium mine. Bob must 'claim' each section of each part of the mine...but cannot take too long in each area, or the radiation will kill him.

Taking the role of Bob, players must traverse through different types of areas inside the nuclear mine. In the first level, "Lift", Bob must walk on each part of the screen to 'claim' it. Avoid the monsters by jumping over them or grab an old miner possession to become energized and grab a mutant for points. Use the lift to reach the higher parts of the screen.

The next area is the Crusher, with the same goal as Lift but more challenging as the player must also avoid getting crushed. The last part is the Radioactive Waste, where the goal is again the same, but the player must maneuver Bob around the radioactive waste. In each screen, there is a timer in the upper right. If this timer reached zero before you claim all sections, you lose a life.

After you have beaten all three screens, they repeat but without any of the bonuses for energizing, so you must jump over or avoid all mutants.</desc>
	<path>./Mines of Minos (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are the last mining robot on the Minos mine. Monsters have destroyed all your comrades.

As the last robot, you must traverse the mine's various levels, gathering spare parts to make more robots (extra lives). You must either avoid the monsters or blow them up with a bomb. After a few seconds, if the monster hasn't hit the bomb, it will explode harmlessly. You can only drop one bomb at a time. If a monster is killed, it will regenerate somewhere in the maze.

To deposit your spare parts, you must get to the center top or bottom of any level. To move to another level, hold your joystick button down while moving through the tunnels on either side. You can also use these tunnels, without holding down the button, to quickly get from left or right side of the maze to avoid monsters.

To win the game, get to level five and ram each of the three stationary monsters to kill them. You will need at least two spare robots as the ramming will destroy you and the monster.

In two player games, player one is the robot, player two is a monster. If the robot runs into the monster being controlled, the monster is destroyed instead of the robot. However, by pushing the joystick button, player two can switch to another monster, allowing the robot to run into an uncontrolled (and therefore deadly) monster.

	<desc>This is a computer game simulation of a Miniature Golf course. It attempts to refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance.  As in a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the "cup."  Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated.

Rather than a full 18 holes, this Miniature Golf variation has a nine-hole half-course. Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the cup. The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes. While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it. So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole.

Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.</desc>

If anything gets through, one of your cities could be destroyed. When all of the cities are gone, the game is over. On each level you have a limited amount of ammo, so make sure most (if not all) of your shots are accurate or you could run out of ammo and leave your cities at risk! As the levels progress, there are more and more enemy weapons to destroy which come in at an increasingly faster rate.</desc>

	<desc>Missile Control is a Missile Command-style game. The player has to defend their cities from incoming bombs fire by alien spaceships.

The player controls a cursor on the screen which indicates the direction of fire for the defense missiles. Once launched, they travel in a straight line from the launcher through the point the player specified until they hit an object. Each level is won by destroying all alien spaceships. The player loses once all their cities are destroyed. Bonus cities can be obtained by destroying a sufficient number of alien spacecraft.

The game gets progressively harder, for example bombs will fall faster and energy barriers might protect the aliens from the player's attacks. To get around the barriers, players can deflect their shots from large defense missiles launched at the sides of the screen.</desc>

As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>

There are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten.

In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. 

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.</desc>

	<path>./Ms. Pac-Man (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

Once you have caught one of each of the other symbols, then the heart (representing love) comes down. You MUST catch the heart to end the round and go to the next round. If you miss the heart, you lose a life.

Just under the Music Machine is Mr. Pims. He tries to mess you up by dropping down his assistants, the Pudgeons. If you catch a Pudgeon, you lose a life.

	<path>./Name This Game (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You have just discovered some buried treasure at the bottom of the sea, and now you have to protect it! You control a diver at the bottom of the screen, and there is a giant octopus and killer shark you need to deal with. Each time an octopus tentacle touches the bottom of the screen, or the shark catches you some of your treasure will be lost. To deal with these creatures, your diver has a harpoon. You need to make sure that you shoot the shark before it can make it's way to the bottom of the screen and catch you (the shark will appear again at the top of the screen each time it is shot.) The octopus' tentacles will be reaching downward; each time a tentacle is shot it will retreat back to the top so you need to keep shooting the tentacles before one can reach the bottom. Of course, your diver has a limited air supply. Your companion is in a boat on the surface, and will occasionally drop an air line down. You need to catch this to replenish your air before it runs out (if you run out of air, some treasure will be lost). The game ends when you have lost all of your treasure.</desc>
	<path>./Night Driver (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Night Driver is an action racing game which takes place at night! Your goal is to score as many points as possible by racing through one of four different tracks. Points are scored by passing checkpoints located throughout the track. If your car crashes into the side of the road, oncoming cars, or any other obstacles, you will lose all of your speed and a lot of time! The game ends when the 90 second time limit is up. The four tracks you can choose from are beginner, pro, expert, and random (this track is different every time and can not be memorized like the other three).

	<desc>Jason has taken the Golden Fleece from the gods! They are naturally upset and have imprisoned Jason in the Temple of Aphrodite with deadly Furies running overhead. You control Jason and your goal is to eliminate all of the Furies to move on to the next level. The Furies can be destroyed if they are hit with a magical brick from the roof of the temple. You are armed with an unlimited supply of stones, throwing a stone at the roof will cause a brick to  fall (be careful, you'll lose a life if you hit yourself with a falling brick instead of the Furies). When a Fury is hit by a brick it is destroyed, but if you accidentally hit a Fury with a stone then it will multiply! The Furies will also be firing at you, and if you'll lose a life if hit. The game ends when you have no more lives left in reserve. Several difficulty levels are available.</desc>
	<path>./Nuts (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Obelix (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>A classic Asterix &amp; Obelix game where you simultaneously play as (both) Asterix and Obelix maintaining their favorite Gaulish sport of thumping the living daylights out of Roman soldiers.

The objective of the game is to help Asterix "stun" Roman soldiers (simply by running into them, and they turn white from blue) while you command good ol'Obelix to throws his oversized Menhirs down at stunned Romans with a splat.

If by any chance a stunned soldier is not whacked by a flying menhir, they turn "red" and hostile, which means Asterix is in trouble. In any case, he needs some good ol' magic potion from Getafix in order to defeat the "red" Romans, so be ready to catch some when Getafix comes knocking.

There are 2 types of Roman soldiers to thump: the fat legionnaires and the small centurions. Centurions are worth more points.</desc>
	<path>./Off the Wall (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Off The Wall is an arcade action game with Breakout style gameplay. You control Kung Fu Lu, whose mission is to destroy a mysterious, evil wall by reflecting a bouncing ball into the bricks that make up the wall. When the bricks are hit by the ball, they are destroyed. On the top of the screen is a mystical dragon which guards the wall. Each level can be completed by either destroying all of the bricks in the wall, or hitting the dragon six times with the ball. Once the first level is completed, a blackbird will also appear on screen just below the wall. The blackbird will deflect the ball, and tries to get in the way to make your mission more difficult. From time to time, a magic token will fall downward which gives you special powers if caught. These can make the ball magnetic and follow your player, give you a larger paddle, or make the ball explosive and take out larger chunks of bricks. You start the game at a skill level of Peasant, and advance in rank every time four waves of bricks are cleared. You lose a life every time the ball falls off the bottoms of the screen, and the game ends when you lose all five of your lives.</desc>
	<path>./Off Your Rocker (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc>Off Your Rocker is a Simon Says... type game for one to four players, alternating. The character on the screen will lean towards a colored shape while a tone sounds. You must lean in the same direction on your joyboard. As the game progresses, the sequences get longer and more complex. In two or more player games, each player alternates to see who can do the most sequences.</desc>
	<path>./Official Frogger, The (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Starpath Version - The player guides a frog which starts at the bottom of the screen, to his home in one of 5 slots at the top of the screen. The lower half of the screen contains a road with motor vehicles, which in various versions include cars, trucks, buses, dune buggies, bulldozers, vans, taxis, bicyclists, and/or motorcycles, speeding along it horizontally.</desc>
	<path>./Oink! (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Oink! is based on the fairy tale of the three little pigs. The big bad wolf is trying to blow down each of the pigs houses. You control each pig one at a time. The wolf is at the bottom of the screen and will blow a hole in the house one section at a time. Each time a hole is formed, the pig must patch it up quickly so the wolf can't get in. New materials are located at the top of the screen, and you need to grab them and place them in the holes as they are formed. The longer you last, the tougher the wolf will become! You start the game controlling the pig whose house is made of straw; when he is caught, you move on to the pig in the house made of sticks. Finally you will control the pig in the house made of bricks. When all three pigs have been caught by the wolf, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Okie Dokie (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>Okie Dokie is a puzzle game where you are to clear the screen of all the items. You do this by clicking the item to 'flip' it to off. But things are not as easy as that. When you flip an item, the spaces above, below, to the left and to the right of it are reversed. If the items in those spaces were on, they turn off but if the items in those spaces were off, they turn back on. Try to clear the screen in the fewest moves.</desc>
	<path>./Omega Race (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game.  You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you.  Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too.  The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</desc>
	<path>./Open Sesame (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Open, Sesame! is an action platform game. You control Ali Baba, and your goal is to reach the cave of treasures. The treasury entrance is at the top of the screen, and you begin each level at the bottom and need to climb your way up. To do so, you will need to find a good location where you can throw a rope up to the next platform and climb up (there will be a dot on the platform where you can safely throw a rope, two on each floor). Before the treasury can be entered, you need to attach ropes to each of the possible locations. To hinder your progress, there are guards wandering each of the floors. If you're caught, you'll lose a life! To help out, a magic ball will appear on screen from time to time; if caught, this can be used to temporarily freeze a guard. When you successfully enter the treasury, you then move on to the next level of gameplay.</desc>
	<path>./Oscar's Trash Race (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>It is the Grouch Day Picnic and three little grouches (Herman, Grungetta and Sloppy) want to win the Trash Race.

Game one is a practice race. The trash truck dumps one to five items. One of the trash cans at the top will then have a number on it. Press the button on the controller for that can the use the arrow keys to move it to the trash. Once you get the trash, move the grouch back to the top. You get one point per race. There are three races per game then Oscar appears to congratulate the winner (in his own grouchy way).

Game two is the same as game one except there will be a number on all three trash cans and you must select the one that corresponds to the number of items.

Both games one and two are one player only.

In games three and four, the truck dumps one to nine items. You again select the correct grouch but this time there are puddles, three in game three, several in game four. You get one point for each puddle you jump. If you step into a puddle, the grouch will play in it, delaying you. There are three races in game three, five in game four.

In game five, you run races one after another until Slimey the inchworm gets from one side of the screen to the other. Once Slimey get to the other side, the races ends. There are several puddles. You get one point per puddle jumped and one point per race completed.

Games six and seven are the same as five but it will rain sometimes. When it does, the puddles turn blue. If you jump a blue puddle, you get two points.

The trash items are:
bones
hangers
coffee mugs
toothbrush (presumably used)
old tin can
old televisions
old ten-gallon hats
old telephones
old tennis shoes
old dress shoes
junk mail
scissors
old toy boats
hammers
beach balls

	<path>./Othello (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Othello is a conversion of the board game. Each player tries to fill the game board with as many discs of his color as possible. On each turn the player places a disc on the board by selecting a location where the opponents discs will become trapped between two of his discs. The trapped discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when the board is filled or time runs out, and the player with the greatest number of his color discs on the board wins. Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.</desc>
	<path>./Out of Control (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This is an obstacle race in a space ship. The ship controls in a rather Asteroids-like way, in that you push left or right to rotate and press fire to thrust. Once you stop thrusting, the ship does not immediately stop, although it will slow down on its own. To stop sooner, you have to face away from the direction you are traveling and thrust.

First, you must pass a set number of hurdles. If there is a single hurdle, you must pass on the side indicated by the arrow. If there are two hurdles, you must pass in between them. If there are three, you can pass through them or go around. If you hit a hurdle, you must go back to the last successfully passed hurdle and do it again to continue.

After the hurdles, you must pop ten space balloons by running in to them. They appear one at a time at random spots on the screen. After you pop all ten balloons, you must dock in the space dock to end the race.

The difficulty switches are not used. You select your game variation by moving the joystick up or down.

Game variations
There are 28 variations. The odd numbered ones have fast maneuvering, the even numbered ones, slow.

The number of hurdles also varies. The first two have 10 hurdles, the next two, 14, then 22 (twice), 27 (twice), 35 (twice), 39 (four times), 47 (twice), 51 (twice), 54 (twice), 63 (twice), 64 (twice), 72 (twice), and 82 (twice).</desc>
	<path>./Outlaw (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You're a gunslinger in the old west! Outlaw features both one and two player games. In the one player version, your goal is to shoot a moving target as many times as possible in 99 seconds. In the two player version, each player tries to be the first to shoot his opponent ten times. Several game variations are included in both the one and two player versions. In the middle of the screen is one of several possible obstacles to make the game more difficult. A giant cactus, a stagecoach, a moving stagecoach, or a breakable wall all can block the target or provide some shelter for you to hide from your opponents shots. You also have the choice of unlimited fire, or only a six shooter. If you choose the six shooter, then each player must use up all six shots before either player can reload. And lastly, there is the "getaway" option. With getaway, a player may move immediately after firing; without getaway, a player must remain stationary for as long as his bullet is on the screen.</desc>

	<desc>"In the Irata solar system lies the planet Stella. It is surrounded by an energy belt. In this belt there live space oysters. They make good food, so there are other outer space creatures living among them, that eat the oysters..." 

The space oysters are headed your way. You must shoot them to reveal pearls. Collect the pearls and deposit them in the Pearls Zone. Defend you pearls from being stolen or destroyed by attacking enemies. Near the end of each level, you must destroy the Oystron by dropping bombs. There is also a warp phase where you must travel at high speed between space oysters and enemies.</desc>
	<path>./Pac-Man (Atari) (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

Bop a Buggy: Drive your buggy through the course fastest to the finish line. Watch out for the buggy boppers, as they will throw bricks at you, slowing you up. In a two player game, each player controls a buggy and the computer controls the buggy boppers. In a four player game, two players control a buggy apiece and the other two control a buggy bopper apiece.

Tug of War: Simply pull the other team over the center line. In a two player game, each player control an entire team, each. In a four player game, each player controls one of the four players.

Wizard's Keep: Use the power of magic to destroy more targets for points than the opposing team. In a two player game, each player controls a pair of wizards. In a four player game, each player controls one wizard apiece. Note: Even though the screen in split, all wizards are shooting at the same targets so when a target is shot in one window, it will disappear in both.

Down on the Line: You must get a package from the left conveyor belt and pass it to the second worker who will then move it to the belt on the right that matches the package color. The game clock starts at 8:00 and the game ends when the clock reaches 5:00. In a two player game, each player controls a pair of workers. The package will pass from one worker to the other automatically. In a four player game, each player controls one worker apiece and must use the fire button to pass the package as well place it on the conveyor belt.

Handcar: A race to the finish line using railway handcars. In a two player game, each player controls one of the men on a handcar, the other works with him automatically. In a four player game, each player controls one of the men on both handcars.</desc>

	<path>./Phantom II - Pirate (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>This cartridge contains two games: Phantom II and Pirate.

Phantom II: Come fly the not-so-friendly skies.
Based on a 1979 Bally Midway coin-op game, you must fight your way through enemy planes to find and destroy the enemy bomber within the time limit. Do not ram the enemies as you only have one life. In the night time scenes, the enemy is only visible when the radar sweeps over them.

Pirate:
Can you find the treasure of the evil pirate "Up" Chuck LeDuc? Beware! His bony corpse wanders the island looking to protect it! Also watch out for snakes and the voodoo priestess!

Use your joystick to move about the island and use the button to fight, pick up an item, use an item and enter or exit the hut. You can carry nothing, a sword and/or a shovel but you must have the shovel when you reach the X that marks the treasure.</desc>
	<path>./Phantom Tank (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>In Phantom-Panzer, the player takes control of an assault vehicle in order to defend their "energy base" at the bottom of the screen from the attacking phantom tanks.

The game consists of three phases: the first phase takes place in a city and looks like a maze. It offers relative protection with the building walls. The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there's practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it's an all-out battle with the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player's base and no obstacles to stop them.

The player can only shoot one bullet at a time and has to destroy 20 tanks in each stage. Enemy bullets can be canceled by hitting them with one's own bullet. The player loses one life if they collide with one of the tanks or the enemy bullets. The game is over immediately, however, if an enemy tank or shell hits the player's energy base.</desc>

	<desc>In Phaser Patrol you are the pilot of an interstellar spaceship on a mission to defend the Human Federation from the deadly Dracon armada. Gameplay is similar to Star Raiders. You begin with a view of the sector map, and need to warp to a sector where the Dracon are located. Once you've reached your destination, the game switches to a first person point of view where you need to destroy all enemy fighters located in the sector. Once the sector is cleared, you can return to the sector map and warp to a new location. The mission is successful when all sectors containing enemy fighters have been cleared. Your ship has a limited amount of energy; energy is depleted by warping to new sectors, or by taking damage from enemy fighters. If your energy runs out the game is over, however you can recharge your ship by visiting one of the friendly starbases that are located throughout the galaxy (visiting a starbase will also repair any equipment that has been damaged, such as the photon torpedoes or sector scanner).  The game is timed, and the faster you can complete your mission the better your ranking at the end will be!</desc>

If the mothership is destroyed, the game will then repeat, but with increased speed and difficulty. To defeat the numerous enemies, the Phoenix is equipped with a laser cannon and a force field.</desc>
	<path>./Pick 'n' Pile (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.

In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</desc>
	<path>./Pick Up (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc>OK, here's the deal. If you want that lover of your dreams to get off their pedestal and go out with you, you need to present them with the right gifts. Then you can head over to the Love Nest Hotel to really score!

You start with your lover of a pedestal on the left and various items floating above you. You must shoot each item once to acquire it. If an item starts flashing, shoot it next because after a short time, you'll lose a chance. If you shoot an item a second time, you will lose it and a chance. Lose all your chances and the game is over. If you collect all the items needed, head over to the pedestal then head off the screen to the right. Head to the door of the hotel and the hotel sign will say how many times you have scored. Now head left to start the next level.</desc>
	<path>./Picnic (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are out enjoying a picnic, when suddenly a swarm of flies arrive! You control a fly swatter at the bottom of the screen; your goal in this game is to protect your hamburgers (located on the left and right bottom of the screen) from the attacking flies. When a fly is close enough, it will stick out its tongue to eat the food. If you can swat the fly right when it has its tongue out, it will be knocked out and fall into your fly trap. When all of the flies have been knocked into the trap, you will then need to face a large super fly before the level is complete (be careful, it can eat your food fast!) After knocking out the super fly, you move on to the next round. The game ends when all of your hamburgers have been completely eaten.</desc>
	<path>./Piece o' Cake (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Piece o' Cake you are a chef, and your goal is to successfully build cakes! At the bottom of the screen is a conveyor belt, and a platter will appear at the left side moving towards the right. You are at the top of the screen, and need to take cake layers from the oven and drop them onto the platter. The cake layers are different sizes, and you must drop them such that each layer is the same size or smaller than the one beneath it. After you have created a cake, you need to top it off with a cherry. If you are unable to successfully create a cake with the layers in the proper order and a topped with a cherry before the platter reaches the right side of the screen, it will fall off the conveyor and you lose a life. The different size cake layers come out of the oven randomly, so if you get a size you don't want it can be dropped off at the right side of the screen until a layer you do want appears. Although you can build cakes of different sizes, bonus points are earned for building a perfect cake consisting of one large layer, one medium layer, one small layer, and a cherry. As the game progresses, the conveyor will pick up speed to make cake building tougher.</desc>
	<path>./Pigs in Space - Starring Miss Piggy (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Now it's time for...PIIIIIIGS IN SPAAAAACE!!!

This game is really three smaller games. You select what to play to choosing which character you want.
For Captain Link Hogthrob, it is Chickenvaders. A Pigs in Space take in Atari's Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders.
While exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space chickens. Captain Link must destroy them before they make their way all the way to the planet. He does this by firing link sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken! You also lose a life. From time to time, Gonzo flies across the screen top in his saucer. You can hit him for points also.

Scoring
Hitting a chicken on...
Row one=10 points
Row two=20 points
Row three=50 points
Row four=70 points
Row five=100 points
Hitting Gonzo=300 points
Destroying all the chickens=1000 point bonus

If you select First Mate Piggy, you play Pastaroids. Somehow, Piggy has been ejected from the Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the bottom of the screen to the top and board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will lose ground, and thus time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't dawdle.

Scoring
Karate-chopping a meat ball=100 points
Boarding the Swinetrek=1000 points

If you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The Swinetrek has gotten trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The Gonzoids are standing on ledges, throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the Boomeray. When you fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life.

Scoring
You get one point for every mile you get through the mine.
Hitting a Gonzoid=100 points
Escaping the mine=1000 points

The difficulty switches do nothing. The only game selections are one player or two player, alternating.</desc>

	<path>./Pitfall II - Lost Caverns (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You play Pitfall Harry searching for the Raj diamond, his niece Rhonda, and a variety of treasures somewhere in the Andes. Poisonous frogs, eels, scorpions, bats and other hazards get in the way. Pitfall II is the sequel to Pitfall, the original platform game. Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint.</desc>
	<path>./Pitfall! - Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Pitfall! is a platform action game. You play Pitfall Harry who is on a quest to locate treasure deep in the jungle. With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!</desc>

	<path>./Planet Patrol (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are on patrol to find and destroy enemy fuel depots.

Your ship flies to the left, while you control you up and down motion. Initially, you must shoot the oncoming lager, red ships but avoid the smaller, blue missiles. Do not shoot the black ship. Dock with it so you can land and refuel later. When you come to the three enemy fuel depots, shoot each one to destroy it then make your way through a mine field to continue. If you come to the landing strip, just align your ship with it to land and a refueling truck will top off your tanks. As you move into night, the enemy ships become too dark to see. You can then create light, temporarily, by firing off shots.</desc>
	<path>./Plaque Attack (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Plaque Attack, your goal is to protect a mouthful of teeth from a variety of incoming foods! You control a tube of fluoride toothpaste, and you need to shoot the attacking foods before they can decay the teeth located at the top and bottom of the screen. Hamburgers, hot dogs, gum drops, strawberries, donuts, ice cream cones and more will all appear from the sides of the screen and make their way towards the teeth. If a food item reaches a tooth and is allowed to remain there for too long, the tooth will decay and disappear. The game ends when all of the teeth have decayed and disappeared.</desc>
	<path>./Pleiades (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc>This is a sequel to Phoenix. 

On the first screen, you must shoot swooping aliens while not getting shot by them. At some point, an alien will create a shield across the screen just above your ship that will require you to shoot holes through to destroy more aliens. Be aware, however, that the alien shots are not slowed at all and can still kill you.

On the second screen, you must shoot or avoid a phoenix(es) shots but the object is to shoot the alien in the mothership above. You can also shoot the phoenix(es) themselves for points.

On the third screen, you must maneuver between parked ships, without hitting any, to dock at your spot at the top. Once you do this, the game goes to the first screen only harder.

There are game selections to choose to also play only the first, second or third screens, with each wave getting harder.</desc>
	<path>./Poker Squares (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>In Poker Squares your goal is to place 25 playing cards (from a deck of 52), one at a time, in a 5x5 grid. Your goal is to make the best ten (or twelve) poker hands, five horizontally, five vertically, and optionally the two diagonals, scoring as many points as possible.</desc>

	<desc>You're the commander of a Polaris class nuclear submarine. Your mission is to defend your country from enemy attack.

You must face one to three enemy subs and one to five bombers in a squad. You must destroy the bombers by shooting missiles. After you destroy the bomber squadron, you must face a dive bomber dropping torpedoes that plunge to your depth then move horizontally. After destroying him, you must navigate through a channel, avoiding or torpedoing mines to reach the next level. Occasionally, an enemy destroyer will move across the screen and will drop a depth charge.</desc>
	<path>./Pole Position (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Pole Position is the conversion of the arcade racing game. Enter the Grand Prix, race against other racing cars to achieve the highest score possible in the shortest amount of time.

Before the player can enter the Grand Prix, the player must first qualify by competing in the Qualifying Lap within 73 seconds or less. If the player however, does not qualify in the Qualifying Lap, the player may continue to race until the Race Timer runs after 90 seconds. The player will score 50 point per 5 meters and additionally 50 points for every racing car passed. When the time runs out - Game Over. The player will have to restart the Qualifying Lap.

Qualifying will enable the player to start in one of the eight available positions. The faster the lap time was, the better the starting position in addition to bonus score points. The number one starting position, is the Pole Position.

During the Grand Prix, the player will compete against the Race Timer as well as against other racing cars. If the player fails to beat the Race Timer in any lap, the player drops out of the race - Game Over. Completing the race by reaching finishing line will grant the player 200 points per each second left on the Race Timer, bonus score for distance covered, and passing bonus points.

Scoring

1. Every 5 meters driven: 50 points

	<path>./Polo (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc>This is a game of polo, played on horseback. You move your horse with the joystick. The mallet swings automatically and will always send the ball in the direction of the opposing goal. The object is simply to to get the ball through the opposing player's goal more than they get the ball through yours. Some game variations have the ball wrap around the screen, some make the ball bounce off the sides, some give each player one horse to control, some two apiece.</desc>
	<path>./Pooyan (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home. Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground. If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig. But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig. But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too. If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit. Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair. Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall. Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present. Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</desc>
	<path>./Popeye (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Popeye is a conversion of the arcade action/platform game. As Popeye, you are trying to win Olive Oyl's love! She is at the top of the screen dropping tokens of her love, and you need to collect them before they hit the ground. After you have collected the required number of items, you can move on to the next, more difficult level. There are many obstacles trying to stop you from completing your task, though! Brutus wanders around the screen and is constantly trying to catch you. If you collect a can of spinach, you can temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus will knock you out. Other objects such as bottles or birds are also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of your lives if you are hit. Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!</desc>
	<path>./Porky's (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You play as Edward "Pee Wee" Morris, who, despite his shortcomings, strives to get revenge on Porky, the owner of the bar that dissed Pee Wee and his friends.

County Line
-----------------
You begin at the county line. You must move up from highway lane to highway lane without getting hit. You get points for dodging various obstacles on your way to Porky's.

Motor Boat=1 point
The Police=100 points
Porky's Girls=200 points
Attack Pigs=400 points
Porky's Bouncers=800 points
Pig Mobile=1600 points
Last Band=3200 points

Porky's Bar
-----------------
After you get all the way to the top, you enter Porky's Bar, where you have to travel the correct path up the scaffolding, planting charges as you go. If you get to the top, there will be a detonator and so long Porky's! If you fall and Porky catches you, it is off to the swamp.

Porky catches you=lose 200 points
What points you get for exiting the scaffolding depends on the difficulty you have set the game to. The points are from 100 to 3200.

The Swamp
-----------------
If you get caught on any other screen, you end up here. You must pole vault up and release when in mid-flight to get up to one of the platforms.

The first time you are there, you have to collect bricks then place then on the wall on the other side until you can climb out. 

If you are sent to the swamp a second time, you can climb out right away but look out for Porky.

Place a brick=100 points
Getting out of the swamp screen=100 points
Each pole vault jump=lose 25 points
Falling into swamp=lose 100 points
Caught by Porky=lose a random number of points

The Shower
-------------------
Push the random object that appears at center, top into the pit at the bottom without getting caught by Ms. Balbricker or falling in the pit the climb out the top back to the county line. Every time you get through the shower, you stop or slow a lane on the highway.

You get 100 points for pushing an object into the pit.
You lose 200 points if you fall in the pit or are caught by Ms. Balbricker.
Every ten seconds you are in the shower, you lose ten points so don't dawdle.

The difficulty settings:
Left difficulty switch set to A=Shower scene most difficult
Left difficulty switch set to B=Shower scene less difficult
Right difficulty switch set to A=Swamp scene most difficult
Right difficulty switch set to B=Swamp scene less difficult
B&amp;W/Color switch set to black &amp; white=Balbricker most aggressive
B&amp;W/Color switch set to color=Balbricker less aggressive</desc>
	<path>./Power Off! (France) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>You are Brian Mareck. Your father created a super computer to help mankind but when it was switched on, something went wrong. You must deactivate the computer, but beware of the robots that have been reprogrammed to protect the computer at all costs. You must run and climb ladders to get to the 'power pills' and deactivate them. Avoid the robots as they will kill you. Once you have deactivated all the 'power pills' in that part of the lab (level), it is off to the next.</desc>
	<path>./Pressure Cooker (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Pressure Cooker, you are a cook whose job is to fullfill hamburger orders at "The Grille". Along the bottom of the screen you will see the orders for various types of hamburgers come in. Tomotoes, onions, lettuce, and cheese may all be requested and you need to collect the proper ingredients, put them on a hamburger, and drop it in the wrapping machine. The hamburgers will be coming down the left side of the screen on a conveyer belt as all other ingredients come flying out of the dispensers on the right. Make sure you catch all the ingredients and don't let any hamburgers fall off the end of the conveyer belt, otherwise you'll lose performance points! If your performance score drops to zero, you will be fired and the game ends. Of course, the ingredients will rarely come out in the desired order, so you also have the ability to toss an ingredient back without losing performance points if necessary. As you successfully create the ordered hamburgers and drop them in the proper warpping machine, the game difficulty will increase by upping the speed of the conveyer belt and increasing the complexity of the orders.</desc>
	<path>./Pressure Gauge (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>Pressure Guage's gameplay is a simple as its graphics, albeit not that easy to describe. On the left of the screen is a small colored line. On the right is a line that starts at the top of the screen and slowly descends. This is your timer. Next to the left line is a line that starts at the bottom and rises to the top. When it reaches the top, it restarts at the bottom. The object is to press your button when the rising line on the left is within the small line on the left. This will cause a new line to rise. If you press the button when the rising line is not in the left small line or let the rising line reach the top, the new line will lower. To clear the level, get the new line all the way to the top. If you do not get the new line to the top before the descending line on the right reaches the bottom, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Private Eye (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are the great French private eye Pierre Touche. Your job is to capture the criminal Henri Le Fiend and send him to jail. To do this, you will first need to find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you: questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for! If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum, or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks so there will be a greater area to search! In addition to the various cases, several difficulty settings are included which control the speed of your car and how high you can jump.</desc>
	<path>./Qb (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>Explaining Qb is simple, even if achieving your goal proves not to be. You must slide blocks in the left playing field to match the pattern in the right field. You can jump from block to block, as long as they are adjacent. When you land on a block with fruit on it, you get extra points but beware of the monsters.</desc>
	<path>./Q-bert (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>
	<path>./Q-bert's Qubes (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Q*Bert's Qubes is the sequel to the game Q*Bert and features similar gameplay, but is now in three dimensions. Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.</desc>
	<path>./Quadrun (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Quadrun is an arcade style action game for one player. The planet of Quad has been invaded, and all of the "Runts" are imprisoned; your goal is to rescue them! The screen is broken up into four sectors (one on each edge of the screen), with the prison in the center. Your character is equipped with three phaser balls; on the screen you will see the captors running up and down vertically, and you need to hit them with a phaser ball. When hit, the captor will be destroyed and one of the Runts will be able to escape. The Runts will run back and forth horizontally, and you need to catch them before they run into the deadly wall at the edge of the screen. To make the game more challenging, you are only equipped with three phaser balls! This means after firing a phaser ball, you will need to quickly run around to the other side of the screen and catch it before it disappears. You will also lose a phaser ball if one of the captors collides with your character. Lose all three phaser balls, and the game is over. Also, there is a critter counter at the top of the screen; if you fail to destroy one of the captors or if one of the escaped Runts runs into a wall, the critter counter will decrease. If the critter counter runs out, the game ends.</desc>
	<path>./Quest for Quintana Roo (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are Yucatan Sam on a quest to explore the temple of Quintana Roo. Your goal is to find the vault which is hidden somewhere within and return with the treasure that is inside. You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!</desc>
	<path>./Quick Step! (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Quick Step a kangaroo and squirrel are competing against each other to earn points by jumping on trampolines. The screen is made up of an array of trampolines which scroll downward. As trampolines appear at the top of the screen, they will be grey in color; as soon as it turns pink, the trampoline is now in play. Each time a critter jumps on a trampoline, the color will change to that critters color (green for the kangaroo, or blue for the squirrel). If you jump on a pink trampoline, 3 points are earned; when a trampoline falls off the bottom of the screen that is your color, 6 points are earned (so although no points are earned by jumping on your opponents color, you want to try to get as many trampolines as possible your color in order to earn points when they reach the bottom).  If you fall off of the bottom of the screen, a life is lost; the game ends when one player has no more lives left and whomever has more points wins. A few bonuses can also be found; if you see a white trampoline, that is a magic hat; collect it and then jump onto the same space as your opponent to temporarily stun him. Each player also begins the game with 6 tricky traps; pressing the button lays a trap causing the trampoline to disappear so no one can land there.   Each level in the game gets progressively faster; at the end of a level, there will be a single column of fast moving trampolines to jump up, so be careful!</desc>
	<path>./Rabbit Transit (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are a rabbit who is just trying to get to where you can get a mate and make like a mathematician by multiplying. First you must get through the meadow and across the ledges without losing life and limb.

You start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game start back at the beginning only harder.</desc>

	<path>./Racquetball (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You have been challenged, or maybe you challenged, someone to a game of racquetball.

To serve, press the red button. You hit the ball by moving your player to where the shadow of the ball is about level with your feet. The racquet will swing automatically. When you serve, the ball must hit the front wall before it hits the floor. Your opponent can then hit the ball before it lands on the floor or he can let it bounce but you can only let it bounce once. It cannot bounce twice. You serve every time until you miss. If you are serving and your opponent misses, you get one point. You can only get points on rounds where you serve. First player to twenty-one points, wins.

	<path>./Radar Lock (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Radar Lock is an arcade style action game. The player is the pilot of a delta-wing fighter and their objective is to destroy the enemy fleet. There are five missions of increasing difficulty, each with a unique variety of enemies to destroy.

The player's jet is equipped with machine guns, guided missiles, and, in later levels, proximity mines, which can be used to destroy the Drones, Interceptors, Patrollers, Bombers, and other enemy fighters that the player will encounter. The jet has a limited amount of fuel, and at the end of each mission players will need to dock with the fuel tanker to replenish their fuel supply.

To help out during gameplay, there is an instrument panel at the bottom of the screen which displays your radar, fuel gauge, and weapons status.</desc>
	<path>./Raft Rider (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Raft Rider you are floating down a river on a raft made out of logs. Your goal is to guide the raft as far down the river as possible while avoiding the many obstacles. You will come across dangerous rocks, trees, beavers (which chop down trees making more obstacles!), and even a moose, all of which can sink your raft. For each segment of river you travel 125 points are earned, and additional bonus points may be earned by collecting gold nuggets which you will encounter in the river from time to time. You begin the game with three rafts (bonus rafts can be earned), and the game ends when all of the rafts have been sunk. Several difficulty levels are available which control the speed of the current, as well as the speed of the beaver and moose.</desc>
	<path>./Raiders of the Lost Ark (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!</desc>
	<path>./Rainbow Invaders (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>It's the year 3006, and the evil Rainbow Invaders from the planet Pacco, are headed to Earth! They look like the ridiculous aliens depicted in 1980s arcade games, but are extremely dangerous and their goal is to exterminate all humans! You command a fleet of spaceships and you must defeat all of the Invaders to save Earth! Good luck!

This game is inspired by the game Space Invaders but with a twist. Yes, there are rows of invaders moving across the screen then moving down, firing as they go. Yes, your ship moves left and right at the bottom of the screen, firing up. Yes, an enemy ship will travel across the top of the screen. But there, the similarities end. For one thing, there are no shields to hide behind. Your ship does have a shield you activate by pulling back on the joystick but be warned, it drains all your energy so when you use it, after it is gone, you cannot move or fire for a second.

	<desc>EEEEEK! Green is going wild! Red on your right! Blue at your back! Yipes, yellow! Quick! Jam it, slam it. Ram It! Put your Ramroid into action and rifle away.

You, the Ramroid, are on a track in the center of the screen. You can aim left and right to fire. On both sides are colored bars that begin to randomly advance towards the center. You must shoot these bars to drive them back, preferably off the screen. If a bar starts flashing, it is a bonus bar and shooting it gets you larger points as well as clearing it from the screen completely. Be warned, though, that sometimes the bar will reappear on the opposite side of the screen.

A round ends when:
1. You have cleared all the colored bars from the screen or
2. The timer at the bottom, which starts at five thousand, reaches zero or
3. The colored bars have blocked off part of the screen and you clear the rods where you can

	<desc>George, Lizzy and Ralph were just ordinary Americans, until an experiment went wrong, turning them into a Gorilla, Lizard and Werewolf respectively. Following this, the three of them plan to go round destroying buildings, and up to 3 human players can join in.

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human</desc>
	<path>./Raster Fahndung (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>You are presented with a screen full of squares, thirty-two squares wide by twenty squares high. The object of the game is to find a particular set of squares that measure six by six squares. This sounds simple but you are timed. You can view the pattern you need by pressing fire but don't stay long as this makes the timer speed up to twice as fast while you are in that screen. In a two player game, the first player to find the correct pattern collects one point. The game ends when the timer runs out or, in two player, one player reaches nine points.

You start with ninety seconds. If you select the easy difficulty, the second puzzle with have five less seconds. Time decreases per screen until you reach twenty seconds, the lowest time. On the hard setting, you have to clear as many boards as you can in ninety seconds, total.</desc>
	<path>./Reactor (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</desc>

Space pirates are in the area and the robot interceptors are working against us. Your orders are to fly your F-117 Starwarrior to Terra I, destroying anything that tries to harm you.

You can move your ship up, down, left or right. You begin with a top-down view if the F-117, facing towards the bottom of the screen. Meteors and later space pirates come from the bottom moving up and you must shoot them. After you get through these, you switch to a side view of the ship and face left or right. Robot interceptors will come from the sides and must be destroyed then fish force fields (yes, fish force fields) will come from the top, moving down and you must shoot the fish-shaped devices to destroy them. They are Terra I's last defensive line so when you get through them, you win.

In the two player games, player one controls the F-117's left and right movement and player two controls the up and down movement therefore players must work together. Firing alternates between both players in two second intervals.</desc>

Through all this, you must shoot or avoid chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas. Chimpanzees are harmless but orangutans can capture you and place you in a cage in the village and gorillas can capture you and/or shoot you. If you are captured, you must press your button to escape then head south to the desert. After the desert, you enter the poison caves. There are no apes here but you will lose a life point every second you are within. These caves are a maze you must get through but be advised that not all exits lead to the human stronghold. Some exits come out in the forest or desert. Once you reach the human stronghold, you will get a splash screen then your total points then you restart in the forest at a harder level.</desc>

The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life.</desc>
	<path>./River Raid II (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You're the pilot of an F-14 assault jet, assigned to the dangerous mission of taking out an enemy bridge at the top of a heavily guarded river. In River Raid II, the gameplay is similar to the original River Raid, but with a few additions. For each mission you start out on an aircraft carrier. After a successful takeoff, you need to get past enemy forces located over the ocean which guard the entrance to the river. Make sure to collect plenty of fuel from the refueling jets, since once you reach the river fuel will become scarce! Next you will have to make your way up the treacherous river channel until you finally reach, and hopefully destroy, the bridge. But the level isn't over yet, for now  you have to return to the aircraft carrier and land safely. After completing all of this, you move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to the expanded levels, another change in River Raid II is the ability to control the altitude of your plane. You can fly high above everything, or fly low into the channel to take out enemy tanks and barges.</desc>
	<path>./Road Runner (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This game is based on an arcade game that was released by Atari.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.</desc>

	<desc>Robin Hood is an action game where you need to rescue Maid Marian who is being held by the Sheriff of Nottingham in a castle (and while you're at it, steal some gold to give to the poor)! Gameplay takes place on several different screens which have different objectives. First you will need to make your way through Sherwood Forest; numerous henchman are hiding here, so use your arrows to shoot them. Surviving the forest, the next section takes place outside of the castle; naturally, numerous henchman guard the castle gate. While dodging incoming arrows, you need to shoot enough of the henchman to cause the gate to open. Once it opens, you can enter the castle for the final scene. Inside the castle you will be able to find Maid Marian behind one of the many doors, and gold behind another. The rest of the doors have henchman hiding behind them, but if you can find the Maid Marian or the gold then you win this round and the game repeats at a tougher skill level.</desc>
	<path>./Robot Tank (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</desc>
	<path>./Roc 'n Rope (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides. Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points. 

Your player also cannot take a fall, except for extremely small ones unless he is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to "shake" the rope until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope. Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the player.

There are 4 distinct levels; the cliff-side, the windmill, the waterfall and the peak. Completing all of these levels will restart the game with faster enemies and power-ups located in different places.</desc>

You race along a five-lane freeway, in control of a car equipped with weapons, on a mission to destroy certain carrier cars which are causing traffic jams.  You must weave in and out of traffic at high speeds blasting slow-moving cars in your path to reach your destination.  Along the way, you must also avoid obstacles such as destroyed cars, barricades, nails, and  oil slicks on the road.  A radar tracks the enemy and warns of coming danger.

Collisions with other vehicles and objects will damage your car and cause malfunction. The car will repair itself slowly as time lapses, or you may pull over for a quick repair, but you may let your target escape if you take too long. You only have one car, and the game is over when this car is lost.</desc>

	<desc>You are Hotot, a cybernetic life form from a serene planet in a distant galaxy. Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur.

On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly.

In Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt. Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you must destroy the warhead one-on-one.

In the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course, the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix that will try to hold you off. If you take to log to destroy the warhead, it will escape into space. Whether you destroy it or not, you will then return to the Rocket Construction Site at a harder level.</desc>

You can carry up to six divers at a time, and when you safely return the six divers to the surface, you move on to the next, faster level. Your sub has a limited supply of oxygen; if your oxygen meter gets too low, you will need to surface to replenish the oxygen supply. If you surface with less than six divers, you lose one of the divers. If you surface with no divers at all, then your sub will explode. To make your task more challenging, numerous giant sharks and enemy submarines travel throughout the waters and can destroy your sub on contact. To help out with these enemies, you have an unlimited supply of torpedoes which can be fired to destroy both the sharks and subs. As the levels progress, the game gets faster and more enemies appear at a time.</desc>

You are a submarine along the bottom of the sea. You must sink ships with your torpedoes.

You move your sub left or right with the joystick and launch a torpedo with the button. Try to shoot past the mines as they waste torpedoes and give no points. Try to hit ships, destroyers, enemy subs and PT boats. Try to avoid hitting the white ships as these will cause your torpedoes to rebound back down. You have fifty torpedoes and ninety-nine fuel. You lose a life when you run out of fuel. After three lives, the game is over.</desc>

You, the Secret Agent, must catch the falling agent items, like U.S. documents, money cases and money bags, while avoiding the undesirables, like bugs, grenades and guns. After a time, a tone will sound. This is when the boats on the water below you will stop moving and you need to get above them and 'make the hand off'. Be careful, though, for although the boats stopped moving, the falling items have not. In two-player games, the players alternate.</desc>
	<path>./Secret Quest (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.

You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring.

Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.

Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen. Hence, the game won't go long if you run out of energy.

Weapon energy use and damage
Energy sword=1 energy and 2 strength
Sonic blaster=2 energy and 4 strength

	<path>./Sentinel (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Sentinel is a side scrolling action game. Several worlds have fallen victim of an alien attack, and you need to free them. To do this, a glowing orb called the Sentinel has been sent which can absorb the alien energy. As the Sentinel floats above the various, scrolling landscapes, you need to protect it from attacks by using the light gun to destroy enemies and enemy fire. If you don't destroy an enemy, it will deplete the Sentinels energy supply which will eventually destroy it. There are four levels of increasing difficulty, each with a large boss at the end. To help out on your mission, several bonuses may be encountered from time to time; increased firepower and energy can be acquired when you shoot the bonus capsules that appear. Three levels of difficulty are available.</desc>
	<path>./Shootin' Gallery (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Shootin' Gallery is a target shooting game similar to Sega's Carnival. You control a gun at the bottom of the screen while various types of targets move left and right above. Given a limited amount of ammo, you need to earn as many points as possible by shooting the targets (which include trains, snails, frogs, kangaroos, monkeys, and more). Naturally more points are awarded for targets that are further away or tougher to hit. At the top of the screen is a cuckoo clock which counts down; when time runs out, a cuckoo will eat some of your remaining ammo! To avoid this, the clock can be shot which resets the timer. Every 20,000 points bonus ammo is awarded. When all of your ammo is gone, the game is over and the score calculated.</desc>

	<desc/>
	<path>./Shuttle Orbiter (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You must get ten parts from an orbiting factory to an incomplete space station. Unfortunately, a comet passed near Earth and left a space debris field that you will need to avoid.

After the launch, you will see the Earth being circled but four colored dots. At the bottom will be the elapsed time, remaining fuel and four indicator bars. These bars are your orbit altitudes and their colors correspond to the colors of the orbiting dots: white for the shuttle, gold for the station, red for the orbiting factory, and green for the fuel depot.

When you are lower in orbit than an item, you move faster. If you are higher than an item, you move slower. You must match orbit and location with something to dock. Once you are close to something, you switch to the maneuvering display. Now you can interact with an item or avoid it, as in the debris. If you hit something, whether debris or man-made orbiting item, you begin to leak fuel. This means you will use fuel even if you are not firing thrusters. You also have a 25% chance to damage the part in the cargo hold.

Game variations
The difficulty switches and select switch are not used. After you press fire on the joystick, move the stick up or down to select the difficulty level, from 0 to 3. Game 0 has no space debris.

There is no score, just the amount of time it takes you and whether or not you got all ten parts in place without running out of fuel.</desc>
	<path>./Sinistar (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc>An unreleased prototype of the classic arcade title.

The player pilots a lone spacecraft, and must create "Sinibombs" by shooting at drifting planetoids and catching the crystals that are thereby released. Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. At the same time, enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Meanwhile, enemy warrior ships can also directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.</desc>
	<path>./Sir Lancelot (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>A damsel in distress is being held in a castle by a fire breathing dragon! As Sir Lancelot, you need to ride your winged horse Pegasus to the rescue. Each level in this action game consists of two screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.</desc>
	<path>./Skate Boardin' (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In this game, you have five minutes to get from your front steps to the steps of the school. You have to get through this maze and conquer 30 tubes and ramps AND get to the school.

You start at your front steps. To get on the board, move left or right and while moving, press fire. When you are on your board, just push the direction you want to turn. Press fire to jump and press and hold fire to jump and land in a crouched position. You will also see rails, walls and hurdles but these you must avoid as they will make you crash.

To jump a ramp, just ride towards it and be aligned with it. To clear a tube, ride through it while crouched. If you ride through grass, it will slow you down. To get back up to speed, either crash into something or ride through grass until you stop then get the skateboard going again.

The scoreboard at the top of the screen is not an obstacle. When you get to it, you just keep going.</desc>
	<path>./Skeet Shoot (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Skeet Shoot, your goal is to earn as many points as you can by shooting clay pigeons. When you press the joystick button, your player will appear on the screen in one of several locations, and a clay pigeon will fire from the center. You need to shoot the clay pigeon before it disappears off the screen to earn a point. The game can be played by one or two players, and numerous game variations are included which control the level of difficulty, speed, and whether a player appears in a fixed or random location on the screen.</desc>
	<path>./Skeleton (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>You hear faint footsteps, so you follow the sound through the 
maze. To your horror, you discover the source of the footsteps 
is a Skeleton; and it doesn't look friendly. Acting quickly, 
you blast it with your Undead Disintegrator and the Skeleton 
vanishes in a flash of colour. But as you reload your UD, you 
hear footsteps again; and you wonder; are you the hunter or the 
hunted in this nightmare?

This game was inspired by the TRS-80 CoCo game The Phantom Slayer. In this title, you move through a maze, searching for skeletons. Find them before they find you. Once you encounter a skeleton, press a button to disintegrate it. There are ten skeletons per maze and eight mazes in total.</desc>

	<desc>In Skiing, your goal is to ski to the bottom of the mountain in the shortest time possible. The mountain is treacherous with plenty of trees and moguls in the way! There are two different modes of gameplay. In slalom mode, there are a series of gates you need to ski through; missing any will result in a penalty to your time. In downhill mode you just need to ski to the bottom as fast as possible. Each mode includes five different skill levels which affect the length of the course (and the number of gates in slalom mode.)</desc>

	<desc>Sky Diver is an action game for two players. The goal is to score the most points by jumping from a plane, opening your parachute,  and guiding your sky diver safely to a landing pad. The longer you wait to open your parachute, the more points you earn for a successful landing, but don't wait too long or your chute won't open at all! For each jump, there will be varying wind conditions which blow your sky diver off course. A wind sock at the bottom of the screen will help you determine the wind speed and direction so you can compensate. There are nine jumps total, and the player with the most points at the end wins.</desc>
	<path>./Sky Jinks (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Fly slalom around pylons (right of the red ones, left of the blue ones). Avoid skipping a pylon, hitting the pylons, trees or hot-air balloons. Try to get the best time you can. If you fly to the wrong side of a pylon, you will get a three second penalty for each missed pylon. The total number of pylons remaining is at the top of the screen above the time. If you hit a tree, pylon or balloon your plane will crash to the ground. You will not die but this will hurt your time as your plane has to take off again. Hitting a pylon will not hurt your pylon count. You will still get credit for the pylon but will lose time as your plane was slowed. You can press the fire button to throttle up or release to throttle down. Move the joystick left or right to turn. You bank into turns so you need to time turns as it is not instant. Up and down on the joystick do nothing.</desc>
	<path>./Sky Skipper (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You pilot a plane and must rescue animals from cages where they were placed by gorillas. To do this, you fly over a gorilla and drop a bomb, knocking the gorilla off its feet. Once this is done, the animals will be out of their cages and you just touch each one to rescue it. The animal cages will only be open for a limited time, then the gorilla will get back on its feet. You must then knock it down again.

You mustn't take too long rescuing the animals or you will run out of fuel. If you run out of fuel, run into a gorilla or the course walls or, strangely, a cloud, you lose a plane. You begin the game with four planes.

Difficulty switches
Set to A for faster plane, set to B for slower plane.

Game variations
Game 1...Tricky flying course
Game 2...Tricky flying course and clouds
Game 3...Tricky flying course, clouds and faster plane.

Scoring
Knock a gorilla of its feet=10 points
Rescue any one animal=100 points
Rescue one of each of the four types of animals, consecutively (1 cat, 1 turtle, 1 rabbit, 1 duck)=500 points

You get an extra plane every 10,000 points.</desc>
	<path>./Slot Machine (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Slot Machine is an electronic slot machine simulation for one or two players. Players start with twenty five coins, and can bet up to five coins on each turn. The game ends when one of the players goes broke. There are two different slot machines, and several game variations are available which affect the level of difficulty.</desc>
	<path>./Slot Racers (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The goal of this two-players console game is to move your vehicle in a maze so you can shoot missiles at your opponent without getting shot at. 

The games features four different mazes to choose from, each faster than the last. Another feature lets you decide to make the missiles faster or slower than the car. The difficulty switch determines whether you can shoot a missile while one of your own is still on the screen. Otherwise, your missile has to hit the enemy or be retrieved by your vehicle before you can launch another one.

You steer your car with a joystick. Each time you hit your enemy with a missile, you get a point. The fist player to get 25 points is the winner.</desc>
	<path>./Smurf - Rescue in Gargamel's Castle (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Smurfette has been kidnapped and is being held atop a platform in Gargamel's castle. The player controls a smurf across the screen and must jump over obstacles, away from spiders, eventually up to smurfette to rescue her. Completing of this task restarts the game with faster moving obstacles and it also takes longer (more scenes) to get to Gargamel's castle.</desc>
	<path>./Smurfs Save the Day (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In this children's learning game, you learn music, sorting and color mixing.

With Harmony Smurf, the computer will play four, five or six notes and you must repeat them. After the notes play, they fall to the ground and you must put them in their correct spots. The highest level has invisible notes, you must match by sound only.

There are two modes, changed by the select switch.
In Game Mode, the computer plays and you must duplicate it. In Toy Mode, there are six notes on the ground and you can make any tune you like, the computer doesn't create a tune.

With Handy Smurf, items will move along a conveyor belt and you must sort them into one of three bins. You press the button to close or open gaps to guide the object but don't press too soon or the gap returns to the way it was before after a short time.

In Game Mode, the first five items are sorted by shape, the next five by size and the next five by color then the sequence repeats only faster. In Toy Mode, after each item is sorted, the sorting criteria (shape, size or color) changes randomly.

With Greedy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf has a colored liquid in a glass. Using blue, red, yellow and white spigots, Greedy must put the same color liquid or mix liquids to get the same color in his glass. If he gets it right, he and Clumsy drink up. If he gets it wrong, the glass drains out.

In Game Mode, the colors start easy and get progressively harder. In Toy Mode, the color selection in Clumsy's glass is random.

There is no time limit or penalty if you get something wrong.</desc>
	<path>./Snail Against Squirrel (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>Would you kindly help a little squirrel whom often you found playing in the woods?  I am a very, very friendly squirrel;  I swear, I never intend to hurt that poor snail.  As it becomes colder and colder, I want nothing more than to store some nuts in my caves, lest I should be no more after the winter.  But why in the world is that greedy snail always hiding somewhere to rob me of my nuts, just like those highway men?  See what a dilemma I am involved in?  To keep away from that cunning snail, should I go on carry the nut to my cave or gather a newly ripe one?</desc>
	<path>./Sneak 'n Peek (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Sneak 'n Peek is a computerized version of the game hide and seek. The game is played by two players (or one player against the computer); one player will close his eyes while the other player hides somewhere. After the second player is hidden, the first player needs to locate him in the shortest time possible. After the second player has been located, the roles will then be reversed. The game takes place in an old house with three rooms available as well as the front yard to hide in; each of these four locations contains five different places to hide. The game can be played with fixed or variable hiding locations; in the fixed game, the hiding locations will always be found in the same place, and the variable game will move the hiding places around each time a room is entered. Two difficulty levels are available; in the tougher setting, the entrance to the hiding places is narrower making it tougher to find.</desc>
	<path>./Snoopy and the Red Baron (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Snoopy takes to the skies on his Sopwith Camel doghouse to bring down the Red Baron.  A Defender-esque shooter geared more towards the young gamer, it is up to Snoopy to blow his foe out of the sky while catching the various treats (bones, hamburgers, root beer) that the Red Baron drops to gain bonus points.  Shoot down the Red Baron enough times, and be rewarded a medal.  Fail, and the Red Baron lives to fight another day.</desc>
	<path>./Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc>Oh, no! The Evil Queen has created a poison apple and wants to give it to Snow White! We, the seven dwarfs, have to find Prince Charming so he can save her!

You play as one of the seven dwarfs. First you move through your diamond mine, collecting diamonds. You can collect up to twelve diamonds but you must collect one ruby to leave the mine. In HARD setting, avoid obstacles and falling rocks.

After you grab the ruby, you must cross a river on a log. In the HARD setting, beware of the bat that will try to drop rocks upon you, You can press your button to use a diamond's magic to scare away the bat for a short time.

After the river, you must make your way through the forest without getting grabbed by the evil trees. In the HARD setting, you must also be careful of the bat dropping rocks. You can, again, use diamonds to drive it off. You must hit the flashing white line to exit the forest. After this, you return to the screen with all the dwarfs lined up, dancing, while the Evil Queen is driven away from Snow White.</desc>
	<path>./Solar Fox (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Solar Fox, your mission is to guide a space ship though a solar cell matrix and collect as many of the solar cells as you can. When all of the cells in a matrix have been collected, you move on to the next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer; if you collect all solar cells before this timer runs out, you will earn bonus points and skip ahead a level. The game ends when you have lost all of your space ships.</desc>
	<path>./Solar Plexus (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>You are salvaging for fuel in the far reaches of the galaxy when you spot an artificial sun in the area. You need that fuel before you run out but watch out for colliding with that sun.

You start on the screen with the artificial sun bouncing around and a fuel item on the right. You must grab the fuel before your ship is out of fuel, as it uses fuel at an impressive rate. If you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Beware of the sun as its touch is instant death. After every two fuels you grab, the pace picks up. You can accelerate by pressing your button.</desc>
	<path>./Solar Storm (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Solar Storm is an arcade style action game where you control a spaceship to defend your home planet. Deadly Deltoid ships will be flying in trying to destroy your planet; in addition to this danger, a far off sun has exploded sending debris towards you. Your job is to shoot everything that is heading your way before it reaches your planet (the bottom of the screen). Each time an enemy ship or some debris makes it past you, your planets shield absorbs the energy and heats up; if it overheats, it will be destroyed and the game ends. If your laser ship crashes into any incoming danger, you lose a life (the game also ends if all lives are lost). Every 500 points there is a bonus screen where you have a chance to earn more lives. The longer you last, the faster the game will become.</desc>
	<path>./Solaris (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The Zylons are back, and are attempting another takeover of the galaxy! Your goal is to destroy all of the Zylon fighters you encounter, rescue cadets that are trapped on Zylon planets, and to find the planet Solaris to protect it from the Zylons. Your spaceship is equipped with a galactic map which can be used to warp to different sectors of the galaxy. The map shows the location of Zylon squadrons, Zylon planets, federation starbases, wormholes, clusters of stars, and Solaris when you find it. By warping to the correct sector, you can battle the numerous types of Zylon fighters to keep them from attacking federation bases and planets. Your spaceship has a limited amount of fuel; when you see the fuel gage get too low, you will need to warp to a federation starbase to refuel (make sure you leave enough fuel to warp). When flying over a Zylon controlled planet, you will see your cadets on the surface. If you rescue all of the cadets as you fly past, you will receive bonus points and an extra spaceship. The Zylon's have many different types of fighters which you will encounter, as well as some narrow corridors with blockades which you will need to clear in order to reach new locations in the galaxy.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcerer (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Sorcerer is an arcade action game which takes place long ago when wizards and sorcerers ruled the earth. The evil wizards have decided to attempt to conquer the earth, and have sent numerous waves of creatures to stop all of the good sorcerers. Your goal is to destroy the various creatures! On the beginning screen of the game, there is a flying platform: you need to jump and catch this platform which will allow you to fly anywhere on the screen. Next you will need to fight screen after screen of dangerous creatures by firing an energy charge at them. After you have successfully destroyed the creatures on the current screen, a treasure will be left behind which can be collected for bonus points and then you can move on to the next screen. From time to time, you may also encounter a cloud with deadly lightning bolts that you must avoid! The longer you survive, the faster the enemies become. Two levels of difficulty as well as a practice mode are available.</desc>

After landing on a new world and beginning to explore the numerous caverns, you discover the planet is inhabited by the deadly Electrosauri. These creatures can generate lethal electric charges, and are now after you! Using your laser gun, you need to defend yourself from the onslaught of Electrosauri. The deadly creatures can come from above, the left, or the right so be sure to keep an eye on all corners of the screen! There are numerous game variations included which dictate the number of attacking creatures that can appear at a time,  their firing characteristics, and the overall difficulty level.</desc>
	<path>./Space Instigators (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>This is an unauthorized conversion of the 1978 Taito coin-op game Space Invaders for the Atari 2600. Unlike the authorized Atari Space Invaders, this version has all nine rows of invaders without flicker, rather than just six. Also, the sounds are closer to the arcade game. Gameplay is the same - shoot the rows of invaders and avoid their bullets, using your bases as shields and taking out the enemy mothership when it appears.</desc>
	<path>./Space Invaders (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>
	<path>./Space Jockey (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Space Jockey is a side scrolling shooter for one player. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by having your attack saucer shoot down the varied enemies which fly by. Tanks, jet planes, prop planes, helicopters, weather balloons, and even some trees and houses will all pass by on the screen and try to destroy your saucer. You need to make sure you avoid colliding with the various enemies and their fire or one of your three saucers will be lost. Extra saucers are awarded for each 1000 points earned. Several game variations are included which control the game difficulty, the movement abilities of the enemies, and the movement abilities of your saucer.</desc>
	<path>./Space Shuttle - A Journey Into Space (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>
	<path>./Space Treat (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>Your planet has done well but your neighbors have not so they have attacked and stolen your food. It is in a space cage. You must make your way past them to return the food to your planet.

You start at the bottom of the screen, on your base. You must push up to launch from your base, at which point you will begin consuming fuel. You must then make your way through drones that are moving left or right to the space cage at the top of the screen. When you are at the opening of the cage, where the food is, push up to retrieve it. Once you have the food, you must make your way back through the drones to your base before you run out of fuel. If you die, for whatever reason, before you return to your base with the food, you must restart the level at the bottom.

If your fuel gets too low (the indicator will turn red) your ship will actually slow down. Starting with level three, you must first grab a passkey from among the drones to open the cage and then go get the food and return.</desc>

	<path>./SpaceMaster X-7 (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are an assault ship that was designed to destroy Hyperion military bases.

You must shoot the bases enough so that the energy meter at the bottom goes from the "+" to the "-". Once the meter gets to "-" the base will explode.

Obviously, the base is not a sitting duck. There is a force field that expands and contracts, base defenders and , in higher rounds, shields. The force field has a gap in it that you can shoot through or you can maneuver inside the field and shoot the base up close. Be careful, though, because you can get caught within the field.

If you touch a shield, the force field, the base or are touched by a defender, you lose a life.

The defenders are fireballs, heat seekers, bouncers, wanderers, and homers.

The scoring is as follows:
Destroy a fireball = 25 Points
Destroy a heat seeker = 100 Points
Destroy a bouncer = 50 Points
Destroy a wanderer = 200 Points
Destroy a homer = 400 Points

You also get 25 points for each hit you get on the base.

When you destroy the first four bases, you get 1,000 points per base; the next four, 2,000 points per base and so on.

You get a bonus ship after every second base you destroy and after every 10,000 points.</desc>

	<path>./Spider Fighter (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Spider Fighter is an arcade style action game somewhat similar to Space Invaders. You control a bug blaster at the bottom of the screen, and need to defend the three pieces of fruit at the top right of the screen. Various types of attacking spiders scurry around rapidly, trying to destroy your blaster and steal the fruit. If all of your fruit is stolen or you lose all of your bug blasters, the game is over. When all the spiders on a round are destroyed, you move on to the next, faster round. If you still have all three pieces of fruit when a round is completed, you receive an extra bug blaster.</desc>
	<path>./Spider-Man (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The Green Goblin has set a super bomb at the top of a high voltage tower located on the top of a skyscaper! As Spider-Man, you need to scale the building and defuse the bomb. Use your web to climb the building, but be careful of Green Goblin's villians which appear in the windows trying to stop you. If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points. When you reach the top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.</desc>
	<path>./Spike's Peak (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Spike's Peak is an action game where you need to climb to the top of a mountain! Gameplay takes place on five different screens. The first screen shows you approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four different difficulty levels available.</desc>

	<desc/>
	<path>./Spitfire Attack (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In this game, you are an American fighter pilot. Your mission is to shoot down enemy planes, shoot enemy ammo dumps (they look like little black houses) and enemy anti-aircraft guns (they kinda look like sundials). If you fly down too long, you will get a low altitude warning. If you don't correct, you will crash. You can also be shot down by anti-aircraft guns and enemy planes. Push left and right to go those directions but push up to go down and down to go up. Push the fire button to fire machine guns.</desc>
	<path>./Springer (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are Springer the rabbit. You must jump from cloud to cloud, collecting everything you can, to reach the sun.

You must jump from cloud to cloud and touch any items or eggs to collect them. If an egg hatches into a dragon, you can kick the dragon to collect him. There is a bonus timer that counts down on the screen so don't delay. Once you reach the sun at the top, then it is off to a more challenging screen.</desc>
	<path>./Sprint Master (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Sprintmaster is an action racing game similar to Super Sprint. The game is played with an overhead view of the racetrack, and the first of two players to race around the track for the required number of laps wins! Occasionally a bonus will appear in the roadway; collect these to increase the traction capabilities of your car or gain a temporary speed boost. Other obstacles, such as oil slicks, may also appear in the roadway which will cause you to lose control and speed. There is a total of nine different tracks with varying levels of difficulty to race on, and you can choose either blacktop, dirt, or ice for terrain.</desc>
	<path>./Spy Hunter (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>
	<path>./Squeeze Box (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Squeeze Box your goal is to escape from prison! To escape, you will need to blast your way through the wall on either the left or right side of the screen. Once a hole large enough to walk through is formed, you can use it to escape to the next screen. To make the game more difficult, the walls are constantly growing, and if you touch a wall you will lose a life! A second game variation is included where one wall is stationary, and the second wall grows. Your goal is to shoot all of the moving multi-colored wall blocks to turn them white. A row of blocks turns white when they all of have been destroyed; the row will then begin growing again, but you will now longer be able to shoot the blocks! When all of the rows have been changed to white, you will move on to the next level. The third (and final) game variation included is similar to the second one, except that the wall behind you will also move inwards; Your goal is still to shoot your way through the left wall before the right wall catches up to you. Each variation has two difficulty levels, the tougher difficulty has twice as many blocks as the easier.</desc>
	<path>./Squish 'Em (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>Climb up the side of a series of 48-story buildings to collect suitcases full of money, while avoiding creepy monsters and falling objects that try to knock you off. Fortunately, you can strike back against the monsters by smashing them flat, by smashing them on the head. Don't linger too long, though, since they are soon resurrected, white and unsquishable. 

Squish 'Em is similar to Crazy Climber, with much faster gameplay.</desc>
	<path>./Sssnake (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You were hunting in the Amazon when you become the hunted of prehistoric creatures. You found a fortress with a large gun. Now you must avoid the snakes that enter and exit and shoot the creatures through the holes in the fortress bricks.

The snakes will slither from one side on the screen to the other then come the opposite way one level lower. You cannot kill the snake but you can shorten it when you shoot it. Your gun runs on a gun track inside the fortress walls and always shoots away from the fortress. You cannot shoot through the bricks themselves, only in between them.

Game variations
In game one, the snakes enter the screen from one side but move fast. In game two, they enter from any side but move slower. Either way, you only have one life. Player two begins after player one by just pressing the button on the right joystick. If there is no player two or after player two dies, then you must press reset to play again.

Scoring
You score one point for shooting a prehistoric creature.
You gain no points for shooting at the bricks or shooting the snake.</desc>
	<path>./Stampede (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>It's a stampede!! Your job is to round up as many of the calves as you can. The screen scrolls to the right as you chase the calves; if more than three calves get past you, the game is over. The calves all run at different speeds, and when you rope one you earn points based on how fast it was running. As the game progresses, more and more calves will be on the screen at one time, and other obstacles will begin appearing to trip your horse and slow you down.</desc>
	<path>./Star Fire (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>This is a conversion of a 1980 Exidy coin-op game.

It is a time of crisis for the Earth forces. Years of constant assault
from the EXIDY coalition have left Earth almost totally defenseless.

Intergalactic intelligence has discovered a new threat, several Exidy
freighters, protected by an armada of smaller vessels, have entered a
friendly sector of space and are advancing on Earth itself, loaded with
enough weaponry to completely annihilate the planet.

You are Earth's only hope.

Aim your cross hair onto an enemy ship and press the button to fire. Try to shoot as many enemies as you can. Once you destroy all the enemies in a sector, a warp gate appears. Shoot it to warp to the next sector. Whenever your ship gets a direct hit from enemy fire, your shield loses energy. To restore shield energy look out for, and shoot, energy diamonds.</desc>
	<path>./Star Fox (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Star Fox is a horizontally scrolling action game. You control a starship on a foreign planet with the mission of collecting valuable crystals. The crystals will be located on the planets surface or somewhere in the atmosphere. When you locate a crystal, you need to fly down into the planets atmosphere to retrieve it (be careful, your ship has limited maneuverability while in the atmosphere). Of course, your mission won't be easy; guarding the planet are numerous enemy fighters. To protect yourself from enemy attacks your ship is equipped with lasers. The game ends when all of your ships have been destroyed. Good luck!</desc>
	<path>./Star Raiders (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all of the Krylon fighters which are closing in on your starbases! There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starships energy; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shield, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the Krylon that are visible on your galactic map have been destroyed, you win this round and can advance in rank (or even be demoted if you performed poorly on a mission).  The games difficulty will gradually increase as you rise in rank from ships cook up to captain.</desc>
	<path>./Star Ship (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Star Ship contains three different arcade action games which can be played by one or two players.

Star Ship
These game variations are played from a first person point of view in your star ship. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various enemies and space debris. You have a time limit of 2 minutes 16 seconds in the one player versions. In the two player version the time limit is 4 minutes 32 seconds; for half of this time one player will be the star ship commander, and the other will control a space module and needs to dodge the star ships fire. The roles will be reversed for the second half of the time limit.

Warp Drive
These game variations are also played from a first person point of view. Your goal here is to travel as much distance as possible while avoiding the oncoming asteroids.

Lunar Lander
These game variations are played from a third person point of view. You need to pilot your star ship and successfully land on the constantly moving moon. One point is earned for each successful landing, and asteroids and other debris may get in your way and will deduct points if you crash. In the two player versions, one player controls the star ship and the other player controls the moon.

Each of these games feature several variations which control the game speed and level of difficulty.</desc>
	<path>./Star Strike (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Star Strike was clearly inspired by the Death Star battle sequence in the movie Star Wars. You fly a space craft into the enemy launch trench. Your mission: to destroy the alien station before Earth passes directly over the launch trench. You must evade the alien ships that are defending the launch trench while being sure to bomb the red "Hot Targets". The very first red target that is missed when the Earth is directly in the middle of the launch trench becomes a missile. The missile is launched and destroys Earth.</desc>
	<path>./Star Trek - Strategic Operations Simulator (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view</desc>
	<path>./Star Voyager (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Star Voyager is an action game similar to Star Raiders. You control the space ship Star Voyager from a first person perspective; your objective is to make your way through seven star portals to save the Capital Starport, destroying enemy ships along the way. On each level there will be multiple enemies to destroy; typically they appear first in the distance, then close in slowly while firing torpedoes at you. Using the Star Voyagers weapons (either lasers or photon torpedoes) you need to destroy the enemies before they destroy you. Once a star portal appears, you need to navigate your way through to reach the next level (don't crash into the portal walls, you'll be destroyed!). In addition to the main viewport, the bottom of the screen also contains a status bar which shows the number of enemies destroyed, your energy level, and a scanner to help locate enemies.

Two player game variations are also included; in these one player controls Star Voyager, and the other player can choose to either control Star Voyagers weapons or the enemy ships.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - Jedi Arena (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In Jedi Arena, you have to face an opponent in the arena to see who is the true Jedi master. Wandering throughout the arena is a seeker which is capable of firing laser bolts. To be victorious you need to destroy your opponents shield by having the seeker fire laser bolts at it. You are armed only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well as block incoming fire from your opponent. The first player to break through the other players shield wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match! Several game options are included which control the speed of the seeker, or even make the seeker invisible.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - Return of the Jedi - Death Star Battle (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>"Death Star Battle" is loosely based on the events of "Star Wars, Part 6: Return of the Jedi". Your task is to destroy the Death Star before its construction is finished. You start the task outside the shield perimeter of the Death Star. There you'll have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the energy shield. After reaching the Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the point where you can hit the core. In the following blow up of the station you must avoid collision with Death Star debris.

After successful destruction the game will restart with increased difficulty (faster enemies, faster Death Star build up, etc).

Overall difficulty can also be adjusted before starting the game.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - Return of the Jedi - Ewok Adventure (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Star Wars - The Arcade Game (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You're at the controls of LUKE's X-WING FIGHTER, heading straight for the DEATH STAR. Your mission: to destroy it before the EMPIRE seeks its revenge on the REBEL base. Lock your sights on attacking TIE FIGHTERS and blast them with your proton torpedoes. Race along the DEATH STAR's surface, firing on giant towers. Finally, dive full throttle into the DEATH STAR's equatorial trench. You'll need split-second timing to avoid all the obstacles as you streak through the trench in search of the main reactor. Hit it and you've blown the DEATH STAR out of existence! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back recreates a scene from the movie of the same name. You are on the icy planet of Hoth, and Imperial Walkers are closing in on the rebel power generator. As the pilot of a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!</desc>
	<path>./Stargate (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Save the humanoids from the impending aliens in the sequel to Defender. The task is still rescuing humanoids before Landers can turn them into Mutants, while avoiding and shooting other foes, however you must now carry humanoids to safety through the Stargate of the title. 

Entering this Stargate not only warps you to the nearest humanoid in jeopardy, but can also warp you ahead (while on the first 15 levels) if you enter it with 4 or more humanoids, and give you extra lives if you warp with 10 humanoids, so there is a trade-off between guaranteeing the safety of existing humanoids, and trying to advance your position

There are more enemies on screen than ever before. The Inviso button makes you invisible to enemies, but also to yourself, so you will have to follow your bullets to work out where on the screen you are.</desc>
	<path>./Stargunner (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Players take the role of a stargunner for the Yarthae Empire. The Empire is being invaded by the Sphyzygi. The stargunner must destroy their invading ships but beware of the bombs dropped by the Sphyzygi droid, Bobo.

This game is similar to Defender without the humanoids to rescue. Players must fly around the screen, shooting any incoming ships that appear. Watch out for the satellite-like object, at the top of the screen, as it drops bombs. Play simply continues from wave after wave of ships, until the player loses their last ship.</desc>
	<path>./StarMaster (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases.   In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.</desc>
	<path>./Steeplechase (Europe).zip</path>
	<desc>This is a hurdles horse race.

The horse's names, from bottom to top, are: Lucky Devil, Absent Mind, Just Missed and Little Dictator. You play as one of the jockeys and must reach the right side of the screen first. The horse runs and hurdles come at you from the right. To jump these hurdles, you turn the paddle to set the height of the jump, as indicated by the marker on the right. You press the button to jump. The better you jump, the faster your horse goes. After 3 minutes, if no one has gotten all the way to the right, the race ends and whoever was in the lead wins.

There are 6 game variations. In games 1, 2 and 3, the distance between the hurdles is uniform with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.
In games 4, 5 and 6, the the distance between the hurdles is random with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.
The difficulty switches are not used.</desc>

	<path>./Stellar Track (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This is an Atari 2600 version of a Star Trek game found on many college mainframes.

Like those mainframe programs, it has no graphics, only text. You use the joystick, moving left or right, to select the command you want then press the red button. You then move the joystick left or right to select set the parameters of that command, if there are any. You start by pressing Reset or Select to choose how many enemies you must kill in how many stardates. 

The commands and any settings are as follows:

Galaxy Map=a 6x6 grid that starts out empty until you do a long range scan. Afterwards, the quadrants will show a 2 digit number. The left digit is the number of aliens in the area. The right digit will either be a 1 or a zero, depending on whether there is or is not a starbase in that area. Galaxy map costs you no energy or stardates.

LR Scan=Long range scan. This will tell you what is in your quadrant and all the quadrants next to yours. If there are any enemies in your quadrant when you do an LR scan, they will attack you. LR scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.

SR Scan=Short range scan. This shows you the stars, aliens and starbases in your quadrant. You need to do this to destroy aliens and dock with starbases. Like LR Scan, if there are aliens in your quadrant, they will attack after you use SR Scan. Also, like LR Scan, SR Scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.

Warp=Warp is how you move, either from quadrant to quadrant or from sector to sector within a quadrant. You move by setting 2 settings. The first is your direction. You select a direction based on the numbers below:
8 1 2

/
7--*--3
/ 

6 5 4
Next, you select how many quadrants and sectors to move. If you want to move within a quadrant, set the left number to zero so you don't warp out of that quadrant. Warp uses stardates, energy and a turn. If you warp into a quadrant that has only you and stars, the screen will be green. If you warp into a quadrant with aliens or aliens and a starbase, the screen will be red. If you warp into a quadrant with just the starbase, the screen will be gray. You cannot warp through stars. If you try, you lose the stardate and energy but don't go anywhere.

Photon Torpedo=If you hit an enemy with one of these, just one shot kills them. You select the direction with the same numbers as warp. there must be a clear line of sight between you and the enemy; no stars. You carry up to 9 torpedoes and they can be replenished. Photon torpedoes do not cost energy or time, just a turn.

Phasers=Unlike photon torpedoes, you do not need to be directly in line of the enemy or tell the game where to fire. You just set how strong you want the blast to be, via a three digit number, and the computer fires. The closer you are to the enemy, the harder you hit. Phasers use the amount of energy from you as you fired. You also use a turn.

Status=A status report. This will tell you how many stardates, aliens, energy units and photon torpedoes are left and whether you have taken damage and to what. If you have taken damage, you will see a negative number next to the damaged item. This is how many stardates it will take to repair the item on your own. You cannot leave the quadrant if your engines are damaged. Instead, you must try to warp the number of quadrants that would take that much time. You won't go anywhere but you will repair.

If you dock at a starbase, you are instantly repaired of all damage, refueled and torpedoes are restocked. Starbases are placed randomly in the galaxy and never move or get destroyed. There are always two per galaxy. To dock, warp to the quadrant and sector where the base is, so you over the top of it.

Skill (Difficulty) switches
The right switch controls how easily you take damage. In the Expert (A) position, your chance of taking damage is twice as likely as in the Novice (B) position.
The left switch controls phaser strength. In the Novice (B) position, your phasers are twice as strong as the aliens'. In the Expert (A) position, your phasers are the same strength as the aliens'.</desc>

You are a tank that must get past obstacles and avoid enemy fire to reach a base at the far end on the course. You must not delay, however, as you will run out of fuel. There are fuel depots along the course that can refill you but be warned that sometimes the enemy guns will destroy these before you can grab it.

You start with three tanks. If you run out of fuel, are shot or run into a wall or enemy gun, you lose a tank. In two player game, you alternate tanks each time you die.</desc>
	<path>./Strat-O-Gems Deluxe (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>Strat O Gems Deluxe is a falling jewels game similar to Columns, Acid Drop, Jewel Master, Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest, among others.

Three colored gems fall from the top of the screen in a vertical pattern. You must place the gems on the growing pile so that there are three or more of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When you get three or more of the same color in a row, they will disappear from the screen. If you get a combo of three or more levels, you get a high bonus. A combo is when gems disappear and cause more gems to line up and disappear. Occasionally, three gems that change colors and have colored horizontal bars across them will appear. These will create a row with whatever gems you place them on. At the end of the level, a flashing white gem with a horizontal white bar will drop down. This will remove whatever color gem it is placed on, regardless of where they are on the screen. If the gems pile up to the line at the top of the screen, the game is over.</desc>

	<desc>Strawberry Shortcake Musical Match-Ups is a puzzle game where you try to straighten out mixed up Strawberryland characters within a given time limit. When the game begins, a mixed up character will appear on the screen and you need to change the head, body, and legs until they are all from a single character. If a complete character is correctly formed, the character will perform a dance and you will hear their musical theme; if an incomplete character is formed, the musical theme heard will be partially from each of the characters you did create. Several levels of difficulty are included which dictate the time limit and which character needs to be created. In the easier levels, the character you must create will be indicated by text at the bottom of the screen.

	<desc>Street Racer is an action racing game for one to four players played from an overhead view. The screen is split into two lanes; in one or two player games, each player has a lane. In three and four player games, players must share the lanes. Each game has a two minute and sixteen second time limit, and your goal is to earn as many points as possible by the end of this time. In addition to the basic racing version, several other game variations are included as well. The games available are:

Street Racer: This is the basic race car game. Points are earned by passing other cars.

Slalom: Each player controls a skier and needs to slalom through the course to earn points.

Dodgem: Each player controls a race car and needs to avoid the oncoming obstacles. One point is earned for successfully completing the race course.

	<path>./Stronghold (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>You are sent to check out an abandoned asteroid base called Stronghold. As you approach, drones are launched from the surface. It may be abandoned but apparently the automatic defense system still works.

You must shoot or avoid the drones. If the drones are cloned, and traveling in sets, shooting any drone in the set destroys all the ones in the set, if they are destroyable (see Game variations). You can move in any direction but cannot shoot straight left or right. You can shoot in any other direction, however. After you get past the drones, three shields form near the bottom of the screen. Also, interceptor and patrol ships appear. The interceptors track you and the patrol ships just move back and forth over the shields.

You must shoot through the shields while dodging these ships so you can shoot the command crawler on the asteroid's surface. Be warned, though, that once there is a hole in the shield, the command crawler will shoot through it to destroy you. The crawler tries to stay below you but it is slow. In some game variations, the Mega-Field starts to form at the top of the screen, reducing your maneuvering room(see Game variations).

With 8 difficulty settings there is a lot of the game to master as you must start to keep an eye on your fuel, torpedoes, radar, and enemy while avoiding depth charges as the difficulty rises.  You can fire up to two torpedoes at a time. While enemy shows go by your periscope sink as many as you can.  The periscope can turn 360 degrees and look off into the horizon or close to your sub.  Some ships move slower than others, and one of the ships moves so fast that the only way to hit it is by tracking it by radar instead of visually.</desc>

When you reach the last level of the cavern, you can collect the treasure crystal and be transported to the next (more challenging) set of caves and try for another crystal. In addition to the deadly aerobots, be sure not to crash into cave walls; these will drain your energy rapidly, especially if you hit one of the skulls. When all of your reserve cave rangers have crashed, the game is over. As you progress through the caves, they become narrower and the enemies move faster. Standard and advanced skill levels are available.</desc>

	<path>./Super Breakout (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Super Breakout features similar gameplay to the original, but with several new game variations. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. To do this, you need to use the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the playfield. There are four different game variations included. The first is 'Breakout', and plays the same as the original game. 

This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there's room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top. 

The other two games add a second paddle. In 'Double Breakout' you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.</desc>

To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

You begin in the maze. The narrow areas are corridors and the wider areas are rooms. You must move from room to room, avoiding the wizard and his bat, gathering treasure, items and keys. Once in a room, do not stand around as each room has a monster in it that will harm you. Some rooms have doors that have either gold or a part of the sword behind them. When you find the sword piece, it will transport you to the next level of the dungeon.

In the first two levels, you will be able to see the entire maze. On the next two levels, you will reveal parts of the mazes as you explore them. On all later levels, you will only see directly around you. If a monster touches you, you will lose life points. If you encounter the wizard, you will lose life points and will need to get through his skeletons. You will start at the bottom of the screen and need to make your way to the top.

4. Potion: Restores four to seven life points. You can never have more than twenty-five total life points.
5. Cross: Makes the wizard and bat move as far from you as the can
6. Scroll: Allows you to see the wizard and bat, even if they are not in a visible portion of the maze. Not needed for mazes one and two.
7. Ring: Makes you invisible to the wizard, bat and room monsters
8. Keys: Not a selectable item. Needed to open locked doors except on last dungeon. Keys do not leave the dungeon level where they are found. When you get the sword piece, any extra keys you are carrying are lost and you must find new keys.</desc>

	<path>./SwordQuest - EarthWorld (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>SwordQuest: EarthWorld was an adventure game produced for the Atari 2600. The game play boils down to walking from room to room, finding and dropping items, beating the action stages in order to find more items, and seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you if you get the right combination of items in the right rooms. 

The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.</desc>

Beans appear randomly in the patch and you must eat them before the beetle at the bottom get from left to right to get the count down to zero. If the beetle gets to the right before you get the bean, two more beans will appear in the patch and two more beans are added to the count.

At times, Beeky the bird or Spanky the spider will pass through the bean patch. In later levels, an obstacle will appear in the middle of the patch.

You lose a life if you touch your head (yellow square) to the obstacle or the sides of the patch, touch your head to your body, or Spanky or Beeky touch your head (eat you).

The third patch is night. When you get a bean, you can see the patch for two seconds. If you need more looks, you can press the fire button for another two seconds of light but it costs you a bean.

The levels and their point values are:
Apple (5 points per bean, 50 points for the apple)
Orange (10 points per bean, 100 points for the orange)

Each wrestler can kick, punch, and perform several moves such as the airplane spin, body slam, power lift, and more. Using the available moves you need to deplete your opponents energy  and pin him for three counts (though be careful, as some of the more powerful moves also use up a bit of your own energy). If your opponents energy is low enough and you successfully pin him that will count as a fall, and the best out of three falls will win the match!</desc>

	<desc>In Tomarc the Barbarian Senta is being held captive in a magical cage, and Tomarc needs to rescue her! In this action game you will control both Tomarc and Senta simultaneously. Tomarc is lost in a series of caves somewhere searching for his magic sword, and then must locate Senta to set her free. Deadly rats and other dangers must be avoided as you run and jump around the caves. Meanwhile, Senta must defend herself from giant bats and other creatures while trapped in the cage; although she can't move, she is capable of firing magic at enemies to destroy them. You are able to switch screens between the two characters to select which character to control. Listening to the sound effects can help you determine when the other character is in trouble and you should switch screens.</desc>

	<desc>To be born with wings...

Become a F-14 Naval Aviator undergoing seek and destroy missions while dodging and gunning enemy bogeys in deadly dogfights with your 20mm cannon and air-to-air missiles.

You cockpit comes with state of the art technology, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force: Display and main computer, Bogey Alert Indicator, G-Force Indicator, Electronic Counter Measures, and a Cannon Overheat Indicator (yes, it can overheat!)...and if your feeling up to it, give the ol'bird a boost to Mach 1.0!

The gameplay like other simulation games consists of taking off, flying, combat and landing. Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision.

Taking off and landing however, also required additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise (No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try no to run over him...yet).

Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!).

After each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.</desc>
	<path>./Tooth Protectors (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>In this game, you are T. P., the Tooth Protector, and are trying to protect some teeth from tooth decay by the Snack Attacks. 

Snack Attack moves across the top of the screen dropping snack food crumbs towards the teeth. You move at the bottom of the screen, just above the teeth. You must deflect the crumbs back up, hopefully hitting Snack Attack or a falling crumb for points. 

Each round is time-limited. You play until the time runs out then you get bonus points depending on weather you lost any teeth and how many. 

Occasionally, Snack Attack will try to swoop down and grab you. If you are caught, you lose a man. 

If one or more of your teeth are in danger of being lost, indicated by it flashing, you can press your fire button to Reach toothbrush, Johnson &amp; Johnson dental floss and Act fluoride dental rinse to save that/those tooth/teeth. You get three of these cleanings to start but earn bonus cleanings every 50,000 points. 

The game is over after you lose all three of your men or lose three of your teeth.</desc>

	<desc>A downtown skyscraper has caught fire, numerous people are trapped, and you need to come to the rescue! Your goal is to rescue as many survivors as possible from the many floors of the building. On each floor, your fire fighter begins at the bottom of the screen and needs to reach the top where the survivors have taken cover. Blocking your path are numerous (and dangerous) fires. Your fire fighter is equipped with a hose and an unlimited water supply to help you put out the fires. You need to be quick, however, for if you take too long the survivors will die! When you rescue as many survivors as you can and make it back out of the room, the floor is complete and a helicopter will transport you to the next floor. Although it isn't necessary to put out all of the fires on a floor, you will earn bonus points if you do. The higher you get in the building, the tougher the game becomes. Gameplay is for one or two players, and several game variations and difficulty levels are available.</desc>
	<path>./Toyshop Trouble (USA) (Unl).zip</path>
	<desc>Ah, the Bahamas. Toyshop elves Patrick, Quincy, and Robert are laying on the beach, relaxing in the sun. Nothing could be finer than listening to the surf while enjoying a cold drink. A great reward for having gotten all of Santa's toys painted in record time. Unfortunately for you, Patrick's idea of "painting" toys was dumping them all in a bucket of gray paint. While this technically fulfilled his associates' obligations (thus their trip to the Bahamas), the toys--alas--still have to be painted properly.

It's now your job to clean up their mess, which means properly painting the toys in time for Santa's departure Christmas Eve. You must paint the toys as they move along five conveyor belts. Ahh, but only if it were as easy as it sounds! Toys must be painted the proper color, and some toys require two coats of paint (with different colors), and if that wasn't bad enough, some must have their coats applied in the proper order! And not that you needed the additional pressure, but you also have a daily quota to meet. You must properly paint all the toys that appear on the conveyor belts each day before the whistle at the end of your shift sounds!

Santa's counting on you to ensure that all the toys are painted correctly! Can you get the job done before Santa's sleigh is loaded up on Christmas Eve? You don't want to be responsible for children waking up Christmas morning without toys under their trees, do you? Time to juggle those cans of paint and get moving!</desc>
	<path>./Track &amp; Field (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Track &amp; Field is a sports game that allows the player to have an experience based around the Summer Olympic Games. It is based on an arcade game of the same name. Events include 100 meter dash, hammer throw, the long jump and the 110 meter hurdles.

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The NES version adds skeet shooting, triple jump, javelin throw, high jump, and archery as events but loses the hammer throw event. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If you want to go to the next event or round then you will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

There are two skill levels, and the higher your score, the harder the game becomes. Do good, and your enemies will move faster, become more accurate, and the discs will go much faster.</desc>
	<path>./Tunnel Runner (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Tunnel Runner" is an advanced 3D Maze Game, essentially what a 1st person version of Pac-Man game would be like.  Because Tunnel Runner was designed with a built-in expanded memory chip (RAM Plus!), it's 12KB of memory gives it the ability to present the maze in three dimensions.  Therefore, the playfield is a colorful, three-dimensional maze, so you never see yourself... just the walls on either side of you that form the corridors you travel along.  As you move along the passage-ways, additional tunnels appear on either side, which you can turn into by pressing left and right.

Your primary goal is to locate and collect the hidden key, located in a different spot within each maze. Through the assistance of a MAP, you can maneuver within the maze. While attempting to locate the key to exit the level, you must also avoid the hungry Zots. You will discover these enemy creatures throughout the maze. Successfully recovering the key without being intercepted by the Zot's opens the portal to the next level. As you pass each level, you will discover that the complexity and difficulty increases, while your MAP gradually reveals less and less information ultimately, your map will be of little use, requiring you to survive solely by instincts and quick thinking!</desc>
	<path>./Turmoil (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of Turmoil is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.

The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds. The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them. Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel. This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway. In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it. If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points. If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.

When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships. If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship. In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time. You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens. There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level. This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.</desc>

The tunnel is broken up into several different zones, called the mountain zone, rainbow zone, stick zone, stripe zone, bleak zone, and City of Mystery. Each zone features different types of enemy spaceships to deal with, and can scroll either horizontally or vertically. In the mountain zone or stripe zone, you may also come across an energy pod marked with an 'E'. If you fly through this, your ship temporarily becomes invincible to the deadly cave walls and numerous enemies which are trying to stop you. When not invincible, your space ship is equipped with lasers to help destroy enemies. You can fire in four different directions, however your speed is decreased when firing. You also need to keep an eye on your fuel gauge; your fuel will deplete at a rapid rate, and your ship will crash if it runs out. Fuel is gained each time you destroy an enemy, so make sure you destroy as many as you can! When you finally make it through all the various zones of the tunnel and defeat Gond, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>

	<desc>In this classic game of checkers you can play with your friend or many different levels of computer AI.  Mastering all of them will take skill and strategy, as well as a bit of luck.  Video Checkers follows the standard checkers rules with the following rules: if there is a jump available, you must take it and if you get to king's row and are promoted, you cannot move again that turn but must wait for your next turn.

Game variations
Games 1 through 9 are regular checkers, from easiest to hardest in which the object is to capture or block all your opponents pieces.
Game 10 is a two player game. 
Games 11 through 19 are giveaway checkers, from easiest to hardest, in which the object of the game is to lose or be unable to move any of your pieces.

Set to A=Set up board as you want.
Set to B=Will be set up for normal play.

	<path>./Video Chess (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.

To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.

Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square. To carry out the en passant, you must advance your
pawn to the fifth rank. Your opponent then has the option of moving
his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two
squares. If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.

Skill levels
These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.
Level 1=15 seconds
Level 2=30 seconds
Level 3=45 seconds
Level 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds
Level 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds
Level 6=12 minutes

A few of these variations are:

1. Foozpong: Each player controls multiple paddles which are arranged somewhat like a foozball table.

2. Soccer pong: Each player controls two paddles (representing one goalie and one player) and the goal is much narrower.

3. Hockey pong: The playfield is set up to resemble hockey; the goal isn't at the very edge of the screen, so the ball may bounce behind and around the goal.

4. Quadrapong: The goals are located along the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the screen. This game is played by four players, two per team with one person defending each of the four goals.

5. Handball pong: There is no goal, and two players take turns hitting the ball against a solid wall to earn points. One point is earned each time your opponent is unable to return the ball.

6. Volleyball pong: The screen is set up like a volleyball court with a &amp;quot;net&amp;quot; in the middle. Both players are along the bottom of the screen and need to bounce the ball past their opponent.

You then have to recreate this word by controlling your spaceship and zapping letters in the correct order which will be scrolling by at the top of the screen. To make this task more challenging, various asteroids will fly by horizontally; some asteroids will cause you to lose time, others destroy your ship ending the game. To help protect yourself, your spaceship is also equipped with lasers which can be used to destroy the asteroids. If you shoot five asteroids in a row, you earn a &amp;quot;freebie&amp;quot; which can be used in place of any letter. You will also need to use the &amp;quot;freebie&amp;quot; to move on to the next word after all the necessary letters have been zapped. The game ends when you successfully zap three words, the time limit runs out, or your spaceship is destroyed by asteroids. Numerous game variations are available. These control the speed and density of the asteroids, the speed of the scrolling alphabet, and allow you to choose between zapping words or random letters.</desc>

	<desc>NEWS FLASH: GIANT WORMS ATTACK THE CITY OF TERIYAKI!

You command a tank at the bottom of the screen. You can move left or right but you are always moving forward. You can control the forward speed by pushing up or down on the joystick.

As worms move back and forth you must shoot them so they don't touch your tank. Also shoot any blocks in you path. Try not to shoot fuel pagodas. Touch them to refuel. You can go to the far left or right of the screen and not get touched by a worm but you can't shoot them when you are there either.

In the two player games, you have selections on co-operative or competitive. In co-op, you have the same points and fuel tank. When one tank refuels, it refuels both. In competitive, you each have a score and fuel tank. You compete to get enemies and fuel.</desc>
	<path>./Xenophobe (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>Xenos.  The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart.  A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos.

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld. Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it. You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987. Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</desc>
	<path>./X-Man (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>This game has nothing to do with any character from Marvel.

You are the super stud, the X-Man. The object is to make your way through a random maze, avoiding either crabs, scissors or teeth, to get to the hottie behind the door in the middle of the maze. You have 90 seconds to get there.

Once you reach the babe, you enter the Sexy Surprise where you must then give her sex to make her reach orgasm. You have 30 seconds to satisfy her then it is off to the next maze.

Your points are the amount of time remaining after you reach the maze center and climax her times ten and 20 points for each increment of the sexual excitement meter.. You must have the left difficulty switch in the A position to play. Set it to B to pause. Reset restarts the game. Select and the right difficulty switch are not used.</desc>

	<desc>In Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</desc>
	<path>./Zaxxon (USA).zip</path>
	<desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

	<desc>This cartridge contains six of the 1 kilobyte entries and one 4 kilobyte entry from the 2005 Minigame Competition with an onscreen menu for selecting the games. The games are:

1. Hunchy: inspired by the Century Electronics game Hunchback, the player takes the role of Quasimodo and must rescue Esmeralda from the cathedral of Notre Dame. Quasimoto can jump across the roof, avoiding guards and assorted missiles.

2. Jetman: inspired by the 8-bit computer game Jetpac, the player must fuel a rocket but avoid getting shot from an unseen attacker.

3. Nightrider: the player is running from a hostile government. They are pursuing you with a helicopter. Just keep running and watch out for the terrain. The farther and longer along the Nightrider goes, the more freedom is worth.

4. Zirconium: an alien race, not carbon-based but zirconium-based, have invaded the galaxy. They have set space mines to protect their mothership. The player takes the role of Captain Joe Diamond, and must fight his way through these mines and destroy the mothership. Careful about hitting mines, as the ship can only take so many blows. Grab any power packs you can.

5. Rocket Command: magma beings are invading from the inside of a volcano. As the rocket commander, the player must destroy these beings' ships before they launch into the sky.

6. M-4: a port of a 1977 Midway arcade game of the same name. The player has unlimited lives and 90 seconds to destroy all that is seen for points. Points are awarded for hitting the wall, the opponent tank, a car and an airplane. If the player or the opponent are hit, the wall is rebuilt and both are returned to thier starting points, but the clock never pauses.

7. Marble Jumper: this is a puzzle game where the object is to clear the board of all but 1 marble, with the last one being in the middle. There are 33 squares and 16 marbles. The player clears marbles by jumping them vertically or horizontally, like in checkers. Diagonal jumps are not allowed.</desc>

	<desc>3-D Tic-Tac-Toe is, as the name implies, a 3D version of Tic-Tac-Toe. The object of the game is to place four X's or four O's in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row on the 4x4 board.

There are nine games of which the first eight games are for
one human player against the computer. The numbers 1-8 represent the skill level. Game 9 is a two player game. In the DOS version there are only two difficulty settings and no two player game.</desc>
	<path>./Acid Drop (Europe).bin</path>
	<desc>A falling block game similar to Columns. The object of the game is to create a horizontal or vertical line of three or more blocks of the same color, which will then disappear. The remaining blocks will fall down, but won't disappear if they form another line. Every 10,000 points a special block will appear (the Acid Drop) which removes three columns of blocks and marks the beginning of the next level.</desc>
	<path>./Actionauts (USA) (Proto).bin</path>
	<desc>The object of Actionauts is to program your robot to perform a series of commands. Use the joystick to set the commands to make the robot walk through a path. On the Commodore 64, you can alter the grid to change the path, the programming is mainly done on the same page and you can select from four robot designs. On the Atari 2600, you select from preset mazes, the programming is on a second screen and you are trying to reach the 'cheese' goal.</desc>
	<path>./Activision Decathlon, The (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. 

The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.

For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.</desc>
	<path>./Adventure (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>A graphic dungeon quest inspired by the old mainframe game of the same name, Adventure is a graphic adventure where you use your joystick to wander around, collecting keys to explore castles, labyrinths and everything in between, whilst slaying anything that moves (i.e. Dragons &amp; Co.) to get treasures. 

The game has 3 difficulty settings:

1. Level 1 (Easiest)
2. Level 2: The Kingdom is larger than Level 1, containing secret rooms and hidden items to add difficulty.
3. Level 3 (Hardest): Similar to Level 2 but all objects/items are placed randomly throughout the Kingdom.

Gameplay revolves around picking up (and dropping) items, hacking your way though dragons, finding keys to open the castle gates and using magic (i.e. reincarnation) in case you get swallowed by failing-to-follow-their-diet-plan-dragons.</desc>
	<path>./Adventures of TRON (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Adventures of Tron is based on the motion picture TRON from Walt Disney Productions.

The game environment consists of 4 floors, each with flying "bits" as well as enemy MCP attackers. The objective of the game is to control TRON (you) in a maze of platforms and elevators while trying to intercept the flying bits (intercepting bits on higher floors are awarded higher points).

Dodge enemy MCP attackers by jumping, using elevators and hitching a ride on the Silver Sailor. Capturing all 7 "bits" will take you to the next level, with added speed and difficulty.

You have a total of 4 lives in play. Make each one count!</desc>
	<path>./Air Raid (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen.

There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends.

The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much damage that they collapse.

There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of these.</desc>
	<path>./Air Raiders (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Goal of the game is to shoot as many enemies as possible (only visible from the side) while avoiding being shot down by flak cannons (which can cause a drop by up to 15 altitude) and to land safely again before the fuel runs out. If more than ten enemies have been shot it is possible to take off again with an ammo equal to the number of enemies being hit.</desc>
	<path>./Airlock (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>The player is trapped in a crashed nuclear submarine which has begun taking on water. They need to escape by making their way up the levels of the submarine one at a time. Each floor has two hatch keys that need to be collected in order to unlock the elevator to the next level. There is a time limit, though; if you take too long the floor will flood and you'll be unable to escape. Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes. The player will need to jump over any torpedoes that cross their path, or they will be stunned momentarily and lose precious time.</desc>
	<path>./Air-Sea Battle (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game.  On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen.  The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.

In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft. You are stationary. Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile. 

In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above. On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen. Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above. Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired.

In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again. This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits). The controls are as in games 1-6. 

In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above. Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed. When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired. 

In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below. The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18. The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below. 

In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.

Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds. (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets. I have yet to see this happen.) In each of the single player games, the single player tries to outscore a computer opponent that simply constantly fires.</desc>

	<desc>As Alfred, you must run, jump and climb ladders to reach keys to open the doors to get to the next level. Watch out for Tazniak and the Bukoï as they are out to kill you. Do not dally, as you have a limited time to complete a screen. There are three screens and a hidden screen.</desc>
	<path>./Alien (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In this game based, loosely, on the movie of the same name, you have to move through a maze (the halls of your ship in the manual), ala Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs). 

If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot (pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.

After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.</desc>

Your ship is at the bottom middle of the screen. You do not move. Instead, when you push left or right, the enemies shift to that side.</desc>
	<path>./Alligator People, The (USA) (Proto).bin</path>
	<desc>This game is based on a 1959 20th Century Fox horror/sci-fi movie of the same name. You are Jane Marvin. Your finance and five of your friends are turning into alligators due to a failed medical experiment. You must get the alligator antidote to cure them.

You, as a syringe, must move about the screen, gathering antidotes and serums. Serums supposedly increase the strength of the antidote so you need less to cure someone. You must then aim at the infected person at the top or bottom of the screen and press your button to inject them. The longer you take to get the antidote to them, the more they will mutate and the more antidote it will require to cure them. Everything is not so simple, however, as there are normal alligators in the swamp and you will lose you a life if they touch you. You can shoot to kill them and it will not cost you an antidote.

Some variations have walls that move. These make it harder to see the alligators, antidotes and serums. Serums only appear in variations with walls. Some variations allow you to pass through the walls, others will make the walls solid and they can crush you if you get between two closing ones. Once you cure all six friends, it is off to the next level.</desc>

Use the buttons of the controller to move your ship left or right and beam letters to the correct slots on Ernie's ship. Once all the letters are in place, Ernie can fly away.

This game helps kids learn to recognize letters and match capital letters to lower case and recognize easy-to-confuse letters.

	<desc>In this two player game each player controls an artillery gun set in a mountain landscape with the goal of destroying the other player. Players take turns firing at each other; on each turn you have a limited amount of time in which the barrel angle and powder level can be set in order to control the direction and distance of the shot. When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of time you have to make a shot.</desc>

	<path>./Asteroids (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name.

Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon. When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.

The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.

Game Difficulty and Variations
There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 

The game also offers three different game variations:

1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.

2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.

3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.

Scoring
The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.

1. Small saucer - 1,000 points
2. Other player's ship - 500 points
3. Large saucer - 200 points
4. Small asteroid - 100 points
5. Medium asteroid - 50 points
6. Large asteroid - 20 points</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you control Marvin the Cube Master. You move him around a six-sided cube with nine squares to a side.
The object is to get all nine sides to be one color each in the least amount of time or fewest moves, depending on the game variation you select.

Marvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire button. Marvin will then exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot move onto a space of the same color as he is.

To rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the direction to rotate.

The game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest moves.
Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it rotates, so you don't know what color your on.
Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict you rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces.

Eight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.</desc>
	<path>./A-Team, The (USA) (Proto).bin</path>
	<desc>If The A-Team looks familiar it's because it is little more than a graphic hack of another unreleased Atari game called Saboteur.  At one point it was thought these games were the same except for the graphics, but after analyzing them I've found some slight gameplay differences.  On this page I'll concentrate on the differences between Saboteur and The A-Team, for more information on the gameplay itself look at the Saboteur page.  

It's unknown why Atari decided to change Saboteur into The A-Team, but we assume it's because they wanted a game based on the then popular A-Team TV show and didn't want to wait for a new game to be developed. At that point Saboteur was ready for release and Atari decided that they would attempt to integrate A-Team characters into a game that was already finished. The results are interesting at best, confusing to say the least.</desc>

	<path>./Backfire (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>The year is 2947. Earth is being invaded by the evil Kcaj clan from the Yenrut galaxy. You are Galactic Commander Frank Drexor. The United States Space Guard has commissioned you with the task of defending the most important sector of the galaxy from the invaders. Kcaj technology is much more advanced than the technology of Earth. Some of the ships have tractor beams. Others are equipped with subspace energy disruptors. These disruptors create energy barriers that will actually cause the shots from your cannons to reflect back at you! If your mission is a failure, the Kcaj will gain control of this vital sector of space, allowing them to maneuver their troops and equipment much more efficiently and gain a larger foothold in the battle for the planet. This would certainly spell disaster for the citizens of Earth. Their fate is in your hands! 

You have a gun on the top of the screen and one on the bottom, each of which travel left or right. To switch between weapons, just press the joystick up or down. You must be careful when you fire because if you shoot your own gun, you will lose a life. There is a yellow spaceship that starts on the row next to the middle row and moves across the screen. Each time it reaches the screen, it moves one row closer to one side. If it gets to your gun, you lose as life. Later in the game, barriers appear in the playing field. You must be careful when these are there as they will reflect your gun's shots back, losing you a life if they hit. In the center, at times, there is a UFO colored either red, blue or green. The red is worth one-hundred points, the blue grants and extra life and the green resets the difficulty to level one without removing the points. Play simply continues until you lose all your lives.</desc>
	<path>./Backgammon (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in this manual.

Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:
All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.
No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.
A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.
After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.
If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.

Difficulty switches
Right:
A=computer rolls dice for you
B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers
Left:
A=computer sets up the board for you
B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

Game variations
Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player
Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player

Games one through four are backgammon
Games five through eight are acey deucey

Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 have a doubling cube.</desc>
	<path>./Bank Heist (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are a bank robber, driving around a maze of streets (representing the city) in a 1930's style car.  Your purpose is clear: perform "bank heists" by driving across white-pillared symbols that represent banks.  As you "rob" each of the banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its place, beginning hot pursuit after a few moments.  You must avoid the cops to stay alive.  Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite, which you can strategically drop to destroy the cop cars.

Besides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to another (as in Pac-Man), there is an additional tunnel that represents the road out of town. By taking it, you will find yourself in the next city. Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and smarter.

There are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one. Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to town, navigating the mazes of streets, and robbing as many of the banks in each town as you are able to. This keeps your gas supply high, and the money rolling in! If you run out of gas, the game is over.</desc>

	<desc>A very simple math game for kids.

Each game of Basic Math gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a function, and inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is available to ramp up the difficulty. The game has eight primary game settings - basically two settings for each mathematical function. Games 1 - 4 allow you to select one of the numbers you will be working with, while 5 - 8 give random questions. 

Hint: For division problems that have a remainder make sure to put a space between the whole number and the remainder, which goes to the right.</desc>

	<desc>Atari Games' 3D tank game was ground-breaking when released to the arcades, and as such was converted officially to many systems. Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.</desc>

	<desc>Beamrider is a 3-D arcade action game. You control a beam riding spaceship on a mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occassionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</desc>

	<desc>Big Bird wants to win the county fair egg contest and you can help him.

A chicken at the top will lay and egg and it will go down a chute. You must get Big Bird under the correct chute to catch the egg.

Game one is one player only. Games two through ten are one or two player. All games have two rounds.

Game one is a practice round. There are two chickens, straight chutes and when you move Big Bird left or right, he pops right under the chute.

Games two and three have three then four chutes and the game gets faster in the second round. Game two's chutes are straight, game three's zig-zag. Big Bird still pops under a chute.

Games four, five and six have three rounds. There will be eleven white eggs dropped and one golden egg. Games four starts with two zig-zagging chutes in the first round and four in the second. Game five has two crisscrossing chutes in the first round, four in the second. Game six has four crisscrossing chutes in both rounds. Big Bird no longer pops under the chute but must be positioned correctly.

Games seven has eleven white eggs and one golden egg dropping per round with unlimited rounds. There are five broken eggs on the bottom left and you do rounds until you miss so many eggs you are out of broken eggs. when you catch the golden egg, in addition to points, you get an extra broken egg.

Game eight is the same as game seven except you can't see an egg in the chute, only when it pops out the bottom.

Games nine and ten are the same as game seven but the chutes shrink up in the direction of the hens. This means you must memorize when the chute comes out for which chicken. In game nine, the chutes are all the same for each round. In game ten, the patterns change per round.

Each white egg caught is worth one point, each golden egg, five.

In this game, you are a bubble named, with great originality, Bubble.
The object here is to bounce on each of the thirty-six squares and turn them all on. You start at the bottom left. On the bottom right starts the Bubble Eater. He will chase you around the play field and if he catches you, you lose one of your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost.

The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is popped, it turns into a glowing puddle for a short time. While it is a puddle, you can bounce on it without getting hurt.

Game variations
The game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three.

Levels
There are 5 waves per level.
Level 1: The Bubble can bounce on any square and it will turn on and stay on.
Level 2: The same as level 1 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.
Level 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce on it again it turns off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on again.
Level 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.

Scoring
You get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave.
You score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points even if you are turning on a step a repeatedly.
You get points for completing a level and/or wave. The amount varies by what level or wave you completed.</desc>

	<path>./BurgerTime (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.

You are the cat. You are trying to gather up the cat food pellets in a maze. As wonderful as that may be, the pesky canines are determined to catch you. You are chased by three dogs through the maze. Periodically, a green potion will appear. If the cat gets the green potion, it will transform into a dog catcher's truck and can capture the dogs. Any dog captured is sent to the pound at the top of the screen where they remain until the potion wears off, at which time they then start chasing you again. A bag of catnip will appear in the maze. You can grab it for extra points. The goal is to eat all the cat food pellets in the maze without losing all your lives.</desc>

	<path>./Centipede (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. 

The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:

1. One Player
Two Player Alternating
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.
Dual Player Competition
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.
Team Play
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.

Scoring
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:

Centipede Head - 100 points
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points
Spider at close range - 900 points

	<path>./Chase the Chuckwagon (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Released as part of a promotional campaign for Purina Dog Chow, Chase the Chuck Wagon puts players in control of Chuckie the Dog. Chuckie must be guided through a maze, avoiding objects and the dogcatcher, to the top of the screen where he can go directly beneath the chuck wagon to catch it.

Escaping from the maze allows Chuckie to enter a Reward Screen. Here, Chuckie can find a bowl of dog food in the maze to eat for extra bonus points. If Chuckie misses, no points will be awarded, and he will simply be sent to the next screen.

Chase the Chuck Wagon was available only as an exclusive through Ralston-Purina.</desc>
	<path>./Checkers (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Checkers is a computerized version of the popular board game and follows the same rules; the object of the game is to remove all of your opponents pieces from the 8x8 game board. This is accomplished by moving your pieces diagonally forward on the board; an opponents piece is removed from play if one of your pieces jumps over it (if any of your pieces are able to jump an opponents piece, you must make that move). When beginning the game pieces can only move in a diagonal forward direction until they reach the other side of the board; that piece then becomes &amp;quot;kinged&amp;quot; allowing movement both forwards and backwards. The game can be played by one player against the computer (with three skill levels available) or two players against each other.</desc>

This has damaged the reactor, causing it to release radioactive particles. You must use the robot arm to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too much and we have a meltdown.

There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red, blue and yellow. You start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm.

If you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.</desc>

	<desc>Chopper Command is a side scrolling shooter. As the pilot of a helicopter gunship, your mission is to protect the convoy of trucks which is travelling at the bottom of the screen. Each wave consists of numerous enemy choppers and jets which are trying to destroy you and the convoy. When all enemies in the current wave are destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult wave. To help out, a long range scanner is located at the bottom of the screen which can locate trucks in the convoy as well as enemy aircraft. Good luck, the ground troops are counting on you!</desc>

	<desc>In this action game you play the part of Chuck Norris on a quest to reach a monastery where an important leader is kept hostage. The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.</desc>

	<desc>Pop the balloons and score points. A wall of red, blue and white balloons will appear at the top of the screen. You must pop balloons by catching a clown on the teeter-totter and bouncing him up to the balloons. Use the controller to move the teeter-totter across the screen to catch the clowns. Each time a clown pops a balloon, the balloon will disappear and you score points. Each player receives five clowns or turns. If you fail to catch a clown on the teeter-totter he will crash and disappear from the playfield. Press the controller button and another clown will bounce off the trampoline from the right or left corner of the playfield. After five clowns have crashed the game is over. The clowns may land on any point on the teeter-totter except where the other clown is sitting, which causes them to crash.</desc>

	<desc>In Codebreaker your goal is to guess a 3 or 4 digit secret code which is generated by either the computer or another player. Depending on the difficulty setting, the player has either 8 or 12 guesses to figure out the code by entering in values with the keyboard controller. After each guess, the computer analyzes your input and displays results which indicate if you have a correct digit in the correct position, a correct digit in the wrong position, or no correct digits at all. Points are scored based on how many turns it takes to correctly identify the code. A second game variation called Nim is also included. In this game, two players take turns removing items from a stack. On each turn, a player must take at least one item from a stack, and the player who removes the last item from the screen wins. You can have the computer set up the stacks automatically or set them up manually, and a variation is included where the player who removes the last item from the screen loses rather than wins.

	<desc>Mayday! Mayday! This is Colony 7! We are under attack by the Jarvians! Defensive shield has been raised. We will do what we can to survive.

This is an Atari 2600 port of a 1981 Taito arcade game. The Jarvian have attacked. You must defend Colony 7. You are manning the defensive guns that defend the colony. The Jarvians will send wave after wave to try to break through the colony's defense shield and/or destroy the defense cannons. The defense laser fires non-stop so you just need to use the joystick to place the cross hair over an enemy to kill them. If the enemies get to be too much, press fire to activate the Mega Blaster and destroy all the enemies on the screen.. Be advised that you only have three shots for the Mega Blaster. If the colony or cannons are destroyed, the game is over.

The Jarvian ships are:

1. The Fighter: This is the most common and several attack at once, firing at the shield and colony and, sometimes, your cannon.

2. The Advisor: This will cause the Fighters to target faster so remove it as soon as you can.

3. The Bomber: This one will not target the shield but will try to bomb your cannon. Shoot it and/or it's bombs before they reach their target.

4. The Scout: This one will call in replacement ships so see to it that he doesn't stay long.</desc>

This is a sequel to the 1977 game Combat however, there are no planes, just tanks and missiles. Each player starts in a base in a corner, one in the upper left, the other in the lower right. You must seek out your opponent and shoot them three times to destroy their tank. If they are under trees or, in another game variation, behind walls, you must shoot the trees/walls out of the way first to reach them. Each player has three tanks. The winner is the last one standing.

If you are still in your base, you can press the button to fire a homing missile that will seek out you opponent. When the homing missile hits, it counts as two shots. Missiles must reload between shots and the reloading time is several seconds. If a tank is not hit for several seconds, the 'crew' will affect repairs.

There are game variations for trees, which you can drive but not shoot through, walls, which you can neither drive nor shoot through and versions where you can place the trees/walls where you would like them to be.</desc>

Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill form distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.</desc>

If a paratrooper makes it past your fire and lands, it will damage and eventually destroy one of the buildings in the city. After a building is destroyed, the paratroopers will then begin tunneling towards your gun in an effort to destroy it. Occasionally an airplane will fly by and drop a large bomb. The bomb needs to be shot before it lands, or it can destroy the entire city! The game ends when your gun is destroyed by a bomb or a paratrooper.</desc>

At the very top of the screen a Mother Creature will be creating mutant eggs that fall into the formation. The eggs will slowly hatch into various creatures which fly down and try to bomb or crash into your canon. If you destroy the Mother Creature as well as all of the mutants on the screen, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

You are moving around a maze, collecting cookies and bringing them back to a cookie jar.

Games one through three are one player, games four through ten are one or two player.

In games one, two and three, you move Cookie Monster around the maze, get the cookies and return them to the cookie jar, one at a time. Between mazes, Cookie Monster eats each cookie, one at a time. There are three mazes per game. In game one, there are one, two then three cookies. In game two, four, five then six and in game three, seven, eight the nine.

Games four through six are timed. You can carry multiple cookies and keep playing mazes until time runs out. In games four, five and six, you have five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Games seven through nine are also timed but now you play as the Cookie Kid. You are trying to collect cookies for a surprise party for Cookie Monster. Since he hasn't been told this, he is pacing back and forth on the other side on the fence. Each time you pick up a cookie, Cookie Monster jumps over the fence and chases you. He will each and cookies of the path he is coming down and if he catches you, he will eat all the cookies you are carrying. The times for games seven, eight and nine are five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Game ten in the same as game nine (three minute time limit, you are Cookie Kid and chased by Cookie Monster) except the maze is invisible. When you pick up a cookie, the maze flashes for a second so you can figure out the fastest route to take.

You get one point per cookie in the jar.

	<desc>The Alpha Ro solar system is in crisis! Their sun is about to go supernova, meaning the death of all the many planets and the exotic lifeforms who call them home. Luckily, though, the noble Atlanteans have heard of Alpha Ro's plight and have sent a vast Cosmic Ark thousands of light-years across the galaxy to try and save as many species as possible. As the captain of the Ark, the player will have to contend with deadly meteor storms and planetary defense systems to succeed the mission.

Cosmic Ark features two play screens: On the first, the player will have to blast meteors with four-way cannons. Blast enough and the player can go on to the second screen. The Ark descends low over one of Alpha Ro's planets. The player will then have to guide a shuttle craft down and beam aboard two creatures, while avoiding any laser defense system that may be in operation. The player will have to get the creatures back on board quickly, because another meteor shower could happen at any moment. Then it's off to the next planet!</desc>

	<desc>Cosmic Commuter takes place in the year 2075. You work for the Galactic Travel Agency, and need to help the citizens commute to and from work! Each level consists of several parts. First, you must successfully land the rocket module on the planet surface (this contains your astrobus). This part of the game is similar to the game Lunar Lander; you must control the speed of the lander to make sure you don't crash! In the second, horizontally scrolling segment you control the astrobus and attempt to pick up the commuters at the bus stops. Once all of the commuters are picked up, return to the rocket module and take off to transport the commuters to the grand central space station. Of course, there are many obstacles which can prevent a successful mission. Meteors, fireballs and space mines all get in the way and can destroy your astrobus. Your astrobus is equipped with a laser that can be used to destroy these obstacles. The astrobus also has a limited amount of fuel; if you start running out you better find more fuel before you crash!</desc>
	<path>./Cosmic Creeps (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Civilization is doomed! You are our last hope! You must protect the Cosmic Kids from the Cosmic Creeps as they escape the orbit-decaying planet!

The first part of the game is The Voyage. You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay a little more

The second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.

If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety. You need to score 5000 points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you will start the Voyage again, only faster.</desc>

	<desc>You are at the Waypoint Interstellar Trade Depot, a quiet outpost in space, when suddenly a dormant group of alien, mineral-eating termites awakens. They then begin haphazardly making their nest.

Using your probe ship, you must destroy the termites and their nest blocks. You simply fire at the termites to destroy them but their nest blocks must be energized before you can destroy them. To energize a nest block, you must hit a block while a termite is still carrying it. This will energize all the blocks on the screen.

If you shoot a termite that is not carrying a block or if one is carrying a block but you only hit the termite, all the blocks will not be energized and not be damageable. If you run into a block, energized or not, or are touched by a termite, you lose a life.

Every so often, a refuel ship travels down and then back up the left or right side of the screen. You must dock with it (touch it) before it gets back to the top or the game ends, no matter how many lives you have left.

To fire, press the fire button. To move, move the joystick while the button is not pressed. If you hold down the button, you can rotate left or right then you will stay at that angle until you rotate again.

The points are:
Shooting a termite that is NOT carrying a block=1 point
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block but only hitting the termite=2 points

	<desc>As a professional ornithologist, you're thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills have nested in your "old yolk tree." But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.

You get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site.</desc>
	<path>./Crackpots (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>A barrage of bugs are attacking your home, and you need to defend it with potted plants! You control your character at the top of the screen where there are six potted plants. These can be dropped on the bugs to destroy them as they make their way up from the sewer at the bottom. Just beneath the potted plants are six windows; you need to make sure you destroy the bugs before they can reach these windows. If six of the bugs make it into the windows, a layer of your house will be eaten. This will drop you one step closer to the bottom of the screen, making it more difficult to destroy the incoming bugs! The game ends when six layers of the building have been eaten. There are four different color bugs in the game, each of which have a different pattern of movement. As the levels progress, bugs will keep coming faster and faster!</desc>
	<path>./Crash Dive (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>The object of this game is to use your flying sub, the Sea Hunter,  to destroy enemies and get treasures.

You move fastest when in the air, half speed when in the water and cannot move forward when on the sea bottom.

Your enemies and their point values are:
Plane = 300
Helicopter = 100
Bird = 0
Boat = 50
Sting Ray = 20
Shark = 100
Angler Fish = 200
Squid = 100
Lobster = 25

You get 1 point for stunning the sea monster but cannot kill him. You cannot do anything with mines but avoid them.

The possible treasures and their point values are:
Sword = 200
Wine Bottle = 400
Sunken Boat = 500
Crown = 1000
Chalice = 2000
Pot of Gold = 3000
Key = 5000

You just play until you crash your sub or run out of fuel. You refuel by docking with the sub at the top of the sea (looks like a boat without a gun) called Sea View.</desc>
	<path>./Crazy Balloon (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>In this game, you try to get your balloon from one point to the end of a spike-walled maze, without popping it. Your balloon constantly sways back and forth so you must be cautious. You cannot take all day because you are timed, as well. To make matters worse, in the later levels, you face moving spikes, Hurricane Man, who will try to blow you into a wall, and magnets that try to drag you into the wall. There are sixteen levels total.</desc>
	<path>./Crazy Climber (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.

The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects, another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 

Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.</desc>

	<desc>When attending a football game, you had a valet park your vehicle. Unfortunately, the valet was a little disgruntled as he wanted to see the game himself. To take out his frustration, he has parked the cars so yours cannot be driven out until the mess is fixed.

This is a shifting-pieces puzzle game where you move the white cars out of the way so the horizontal white car, in line with the exit, has a clear path. Place the circle cursor onto the end of a white car and press the button to turn it from red to green. Then move the joystick to move the car forwards or backwards. You cannot move them sideways or turn them. Once you have cleared a path, put the cursor on the car you need to leave with and drive it to the exit. Free the car in the fewest moves in twenty-six levels.</desc>

	<desc>It seems as if forever that the evil Morplus from the planet Tzoris have terrorized the galaxy, leaving death and destruction in their wake. But now, our scientists have developed our newest weapon, the Spectron! You will be deployed with this weapon and must destroy as many Morplus as you can.

You have two lasers, one at the top that fires down and one at the bottom that fires up. You control both lasers. Depending on what you select, you can have both lasers stay parallel to each other or move opposite of each other. Your goal is to fire the laser, which fires from one laser to the other, and destroy any enemies caught in your crossfire. The mothership that drops the enemies is indestructible.

Be aware, however, that if you fire you weapon non-stop, it will overheat and then will not fire until it cools a little. Also be aware of the amount of fuel you have because if you run out of fuel, you lose one life. You need to shoot any red fuel pods when they appear on screen.</desc>
	<path>./Crossbow (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Crossbow, you and several friends are trying to cross many treacherous landscapes in order to retrieve stolen treasures from the castle of the Evil Master. All of the members of your party are unarmed, however you carry a crossbow. Using this, you need to shoot any obstacles or hostile enemies that may get in the way of your friends as they cross the screen. You see the landscape from a first person point of view, and one by one each member of the party will walk from the left to right on the screen. There are many different landscapes that need to be crossed, each with its own variety of dangers. There are deserts with scorpions, ice caverns, jungles with hostile monkeys, a lava spewing volcano, and even the heavily guarded castle. The game starts with two friends in your party, with additional friends joining after clearing certain parts of the game. The game ends when everyone in your party has been killed.</desc>
	<path>./Crypts of Chaos (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>This is a role playing game, sort of.

The object is to kill monsters in the crypts and get any treasure you can find and get out on the crypts.

How deep in the crypt you start depends on the game selection. Games one, two, three, or four place you at levels five, nine, thirteen, or one, respectively.

Your weapons are a sword (unlimited attacks but useless against wizards), wand (limited attacks, depending on game selection, useless on dragons), ring of power (limited attacks, depending on game selection), and peace symbol (unlimited uses but you get no points and only useful on trolls, eyes, wizards and dragons).

Your enemies are trolls, frogs, snakes, skulls, blobs, eyes, wizards and dragons. Level one has only trolls, level two has trolls and frogs, level three has trolls, frogs and snakes, etc. up to level eight and below which has everything.</desc>

Direct your man down the tunnels. Pick up ammunition as you go. Keep clear of the creatures... avoid robot fire. Shoot to destroy! Get hit by a robot's bullet... action stops.

Now bring out your next man... get them before they get you!!!</desc>
	<path>./Dark Chambers (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Dark Chambers is an arcade action game similar to Gauntlet. You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can. Hidden somewhere in each of the levels is an exit which will take you on to the next level. Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

Use a joystick to take items, talk to characters and go places to find the king's rose.
Inspired by text-based games like those released by Infocom, you do not type here. Instead, you move the joystick to change the selection at the bottom of the screen then press the button to select.</desc>
	<path>./Deadly Duck (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are Deadly Duck and the object is to shoot your bill bullets at crabs, the bricks they drop and dragonflies.

Each level starts with eight crabs. The crabs grab bricks from the sides and try to drop them on you. You can shoot the bricks as they fall and the crabs but if a brick lands on you, you're a dead duck.
When a brick lands, it will stay on the pond for a moment, blocking you from moving horizontally.

On levels two to four, you have two, four and six dragonflies, respectively, moving together just under the crabs. You get ten points for shooting the dragonflies but this makes them angry. They then drop one, two or three bombs (depending on the level). If you are next to a bomb when it explodes, your goose is cooked.

The game continues until you lose all you ducks.

It's all enough to make you quack up.</desc>
	<path>./Death Trap (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You have been sent to deliver a message. Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.

IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)

You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.

As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).

After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.

You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.

Game variations
After you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.

The difficulty settings are:
Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.
Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.
Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.

The difficulty switches are not used.
After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.

Scoring
Readiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.
Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.
Destroy the left or right generator=2000 points
Destroy the center generator=5000 points
Shield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than zero.</desc>

	<desc>Defender put players in charge of a ship sent to protect mankind from wave after wave of attacking alien forces.

Armed with "smart bombs", and the ability to use hyperspace to move quickly around the planet, the player ship must fight against Bombers, Pods, Swarmers, Baiters, and Landers - that can capture the humanoids and transform them into deadly and relentless Mutants. Fail to save the humanoids from freefall or Mutant transformation, and the planet is destroyed.

	<desc>Wham! Bam! Watch out, ma'am!

You are Demolition Herby and you're out to own the roads. You must drive around a square section to black it out; the object being to black out all sections. There are only three things in your way: the chase cars. When they drive over a line you have turned red, it turns white again. To make matters worse, they will try to ram you off the track. The good news is if you ram them from behind, you run them off the track for a few seconds. If you need a burst of speed, shift into overdrive by pressing your button however, there is a drawback, as I will explain. Something else to keep an eye on is your fuel. You burn fuel as your drive and burn faster when you use overdrive. Each time you black out an section, you gain points and fuel. If you black out two sections at once, you gain more fuel. You will lose a life if you run out of fuel or are knocked off the track. If you lose three lives, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Demon Attack (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</desc>
	<path>./Demons to Diamonds (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Demons to Diamonds, you control a laser zapper which moves horizontally at either the top or the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting objects in the center of the screen. Wandering back and forth in the middle are demons which can be one of two colors. If you shoot a demon that is the same color as your zapper, it will turn into a diamond. Shooting the diamond before it disappears will earn you bonus points. If you shoot a demon of the opposite color, it will instead turn into a skull which will rapidly fire at your zapper. You begin the game with five zappers, and the game ends when all five have been destroyed by skulls. The game can be played by one or two players, and several game variations are included to set the level of difficulty.</desc>
	<path>./Desert Falcon (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Desert Falcon is an arcade style shooter. Many of the Pharaoh's great treasures are lost throughout the desert, and your goal is to steal as many as you can to earn points. The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</desc>

See how quickly (or in how many moves) you can do it.</desc>
	<path>./Dig Dug (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>
	<path>./Dodge 'Em (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You control a race car on a four lane track, and your goal is to collect all of the dots in order to earn points and advance to the next level! The race track is broken up into four quadrants; your racecar must remain in the lane it is in except where there is a break in the lanes between quadrants. Trying to stop you is a second car which travels in the opposite direction. This car will always be trying to get into the same lane as you, causing a crash, so you need to make sure you switch to any lane it isn't in! To help out, your racecar has the ability to travel at a fast or slow speed. You begin the game with three racecars, and the game ends when all three cars have crashed. A two player game variation is also available where one player controls a car trying to collect the dots, and the second player controls the crash car trying to stop the first player.</desc>
	<path>./Dolphin (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Dolphin is a side scrolling action game. You control a dolphin that is being chased by a giant sea squid. Your goal is to earn points by staying alive as long as possible. As you swim away from the squid, you will encounter schools of sea horses which form a vertical row on the screen with only a small opening to swim through. As you approach each school, the dolphins sonar will help you locate the opening; a low pitched sound will indicate the opening is near the bottom of the screen, and a higher pitched sound indicates the opening is near the top. If you miss the opening, the dolphin will lose speed allowing the squid to catch up to you! From time to time, a seagull may fly overhead; if you jump out of the water and touch the seagull, your dolphin will temporarily be able to chase the squid. Throughout the ocean are waves which are indicated by arrows; an arrow pointing the same direction you are travelling will boost the dolphins speed, whereas an arrow pointing the opposite direction slows you down. The longer you stay alive, the faster and trickier the squid will become! The game ends when all of your dolphins have been caught by the squid.</desc>

	<desc>Donald has entered the Duckburg boat race and has taken to the sea with his speedboat. The objective is to steer the boat away from the obstacles along the way to the finish line and do so as fast as possible without losing pressure on the throttle. The game takes place across multiple screens which each presents its own obstacle patterns and challenges.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong Junior (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa!

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong. In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage. As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.

Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior. Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes. The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.

Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.

In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot. Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.

Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</desc>

The treasures are being kept in various castles, each one guarded by a fire breathing dragon. Each level in the game has two parts; first you will need to cross the castle's drawbridge. You will have to jump and duck the dragons fireballs as well as avoid flying arrows to reach the other side! In the second part you need to collect all of the treasures on the screen and make it to the exit while avoiding the dragon who runs across the bottom of the screen. The dragons on each level have different patterns of movement and firing, and as the levels progress will become faster and trickier.</desc>
	<path>./Dragonstomper (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Long ago, a Druid magician created an amulet of great power that could subdue a dragon. Heading to the dragon's lair, the Druid accidentally dropped the amulet and it fell deep into its lair. Over time, the amulet imbued the dragon with cunning and power so that it began to spread treachery and evil about the peaceful Kingdom. The player's quest begins with the king summoning the player to defeat the dragon once and for all. Taking up the call to arms, the player begins by gathering their strength and fighting creatures in the enchanted countryside to build up enough power to become a Dragonstomper. When finally ready, the player moves on to an oppressed village near the dragon's lair in order to recruit soldiers, buy magical scrolls, and acquire medicines and elixirs needed to face the dragon in its lair. With all of his skills, training, equipment and soldiers, the Dragonstomper descends into the dragon's lair for a final combat to bring peace to the Kingdom.</desc>
	<path>./Dragster (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Dragster is a drag racing simulation for one or two players. The object of the game is to be the first car to race across the screen in the two player game, or to race across the screen in the shortest possible time in a one player game. The joystick acts as both the gas peddle and clutch; you have the ability to shift from first through fourth, but be careful not to shift too soon because you can't downshift! You must also be careful not to rev your engine too much, or you'll blow your engine and be out of the race. There are two game variations included; in the simpler game, you just need to drive straight to reach the goal. In the advanced variation, you also have the ability to steer and need to keep your car driving straight between the bleachers and road divider.</desc>

	<desc>Dumbo's Flying Circus was scheduled to be part of Atari's children's series (which included characters from Peanuts, Sesame Street, Disney, Muppets, and Garfield), but for one reason or another it never saw the light of day.  Atari advertised Dumbo in European Atari catalogs and even had a prototype box made, so the decision to shelve it must have been made quite late.  Even though Dumbo was developed as a children's game, the gameplay is quite difficult which may be the reason why it was never released.</desc>

	<desc>E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is a licensed adventure game, based on the movie. The adventure takes place on several screens with pits scattered about. The object of the game is to find pieces of E.T.'s phone. Once all pieces are found, E.T. calls home and the spaceship arrives to pick him up. E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces scattered around in order to regain energy which is constantly depleted with time. 

The phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving. 

Evil scientists and agents wander around the area, trying to capture E.T. and steal the parts he's carrying.</desc>
	<path>./Earth Dies Screaming, The (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are a space destroyer defending Earth against the Trillians.

The Trillians are using attack bases to launch Kamikaze satellites and Trillian fighters at Earth.

When a satellite/fighter gets close, your weapon will automatically track their vertical motion. You must track them horizontally and fire at the right time.

You lose energy when a fighter shoots you or when a fighter or satellite explodes on Earth.

If you see a fighter with a white stripe (the back of the fighter), keep it on the screen for five seconds and you will come to an attack base. Destroy the attack base to regain energy.

If you lose all your energy, you will explode and the Trillians will celebrate as...The Earth Dies Screaming!</desc>

	<path>./Eli's Ladder (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>This game was designed to help teach children addition, subtraction and counting. Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.

The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.

The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.

There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.</desc>

When you take a step, it move, too.  Interesting. There is a button and stick. When you press the button, you see the walls of part of a maze. Moving the stick lets you look at more maze. All very well but you note that there is a timer counting down. You have a suspicion that when it ends, so will you.

You begin in a maze on the lower left corner. You can move anywhere but cannot pass through walls or the outer perimeter. If you press fire, you can see a spotlighted area of the maze and by holding down the button, you can move the joystick around to see more maze. You must find the exit before the timer, which begins counting down as soon as you move, reaches zero. In the maze, there is a box that will give you more time. If the timer reaches zero, game is over. Once you exit the maze, you get any remaining time as your score. If you never used the spotlight in that maze, your score is doubled.</desc>
	<path>./Encounter at L-5 (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Using an anti-matter launcher, you must defend the starbase L5 against a non-stop horde of blue Megalyte warrior ships and their death ships. As the warriors reach the bottom, they fire on your base. It does not hurt the base but would lose you one of your four lives. Sometimes the death ship takes a dive towards your base, firing as it goes. If it reaches your base, it will destroy your generator, losing you a life.

As hordes of Megalye ships descend, you can hold down the fire button. This will keep the anti-matter launcher in place and moving the paddle will shift the cursor and thus your aim. If you are in danger of being shot or need to destroy a death ship, just release the button and then you can move the launcher left or right.

There are 26 game variations. The odd numbered ones are one player, the even numbered are two player.

Scoring
You score ten points for each death ship you destroy
Your points vary for the warrior ships. The farther from you they are, the more the points.</desc>

	<desc>What started out as a nice little archaeological expedition has suddenly become a nightmarish fight for survival! A team of archaeologists is trapped in an underground maze of dark, winding tunnels. All around them, fearsome zombies are emerging from the crypts. The archaeologists' only hope of survival (apart from some very fast running) is an ancient device known as the 'make-break', which can be used to either create or destroy pieces of wall.

In this increasingly frantic one or two-player arcade game, you'll need wits as well as dexterity. You'll have to think on the fly, plan strategically and race through the maze as fast as you can. Fail to keep up the pace and you're zombie fodder. Good luck!</desc>
	<path>./Escape from the Mindmaster (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You've been abducted! Kidnapped! Shanghaied! You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes.

You begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.

There are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:
Maze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.
Maze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow
Maze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence
Maze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once
Maze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five attempts.

You start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.

After you destroy ten towers, a tunnel will open so you can get underground. You will have three chances to get underground. If you choose to remain above ground, the firing rate of the enemies doubles.

Underground, the tunnel narrows after a time. If, after you hit ten towers underground, the firing speed doubles.

Points:
Hitting a tall above ground tower=50 points
Hitting a short above ground tower=20 points
Hitting an underground tower=50 to 360 points
Getting through tunnel safely without hitting a tower=20 points

After a certain amount of towers are hit, the ground turns from green to blue. When this happens, if you hit ten towers, you get an extra man. You can only have a maximum of eight extra men.</desc>

	<desc>Fantastic Voyage is a vertically scrolling shooter for one player. The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.</desc>

	<path>./Final Approach (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are an air traffic controller at an international airport. You must guide planes in to landing safely.

Your first screen is the Approach Control Radar screen or ARC. You must guide the aircraft , using the cursor, until they are headed left to right along the yellow line headed towards the black stripe. Make sure the other planes are headed where they won't immediately head towards each other or off screen.

After the plane gets near the black stripe, move the cursor to the center red light and press the button. You will then be on the Ground Control Approach screen or GCA. Here you must center the plane's nose on the glide slope and localizer before it arrives at the end of the runway. If the landing is successful, the plane will disappear from the ARC screen and a new one will appear soon to take its place. If not, when you press your joystick button and return to the ARC screen, the plane will still be there. If a plane starts flashing on the ARC and you hear an emergency sound, this plane has an emergency and must be landed first.

Scoring
Successful landing=25 points
Successful emergency landing if landing before other planes=50 points
Aircraft wanders off radar=lose 5 points

You get a control error (lose a life) if you allow a near miss or do not immediately land an aircraft in distress. You are allowed an additional control error (extra life) every 500 points.

Your goal is to save the worker who is trapped in the warehouse; on the right side of the screen is a firetruck with an adjustable ladder. You can move the ladder to the appropriate floor of the building to climb up and rescue the trapped worker. Depending on which floors have caught fire, the worker will move to the lowest floor he can which isn't burning; you'll need to estimate which floor he'll be on when you position the ladder. Once the worker is safe, you move on to the next (more challenging) level. The fire in the building may spread quickly! If necessary, you can use a fire hose to put out the fire. Of course, you have a limited supply of water so make sure you don't run out! As the levels progress, the building becomes shorter and the fire spreads faster which means you don't have as much time in which to rescue the trapped victims.</desc>

	<path>./Flag Capture (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Flag Capture is an action/strategy game for one or two players. Your goal is to locate a flag hidden somewhere on a 9x7 grid. Using the joystick you can move your explorer around the grid; on any square you can press the button to see if the flag is located in that square, or if not to receive a clue as to the flags location. If the square doesn't contain the flag, one of several items may appear: an arrow indicating what direction the flag is, a number indicating how many squares away the flag is, or a bomb which will cause you to have to start again. In the one player game your goal is to locate as many flags as possible in the 75 second time limit. There are several varieties of two players games: in free-for-all, both players can move around the grid simultaneously and whomever finds the flag first scores a point. In the other two player games, players take turns moving around the grid. Several skill levels are available which control the players moving speed, allow the flag to be stationary or move, or add an invisible wall around the playfield.</desc>

	<desc>You are Flash Gordon. Many spacemen have entered Spider City but never returned. Your job, Flash, is two fold. Rescue any spacemen you find in the tunnels of Spider City and destroy all the hatching pods.

The lower part of the screen is a map. You are the horizontal line, the hatching pods are the vertical lines and the Disrupters are the crosses. The upper part of the screen is the close-up of the action.

You rescue spacemen by touching them with your ship. You destroy hatching pods, and the spider warriors that hatch, by flying to the pods then shooting the warriors.

You can also shoot generators, patrol ships and debris. Shooting the generator will keep the Disrupter from moving about the city for a little bit but the debris never stops while you are within, so don't hang out in the Disrupter.

If you destroy five warriors at one hatching pod or your ship is destroyed when it returns, you will have a shield for a short time. There will be two beeps to warn you of the shield leaving.

The scoring is as follows:
10 points = Debris
25 points = Patrol Ship
70 points = Rescued Spaceman
100 points = Disrupter Generator

You get 100 points for killing the first warrior at a pod, 200 for the second, 300 for the third and so on.

You lose 1,000 points if you shoot a spaceman, but Flash Gordon would never do that, right?

Every time you conquer a city, you get an extra man.</desc>

Using the joystick you can choose from one of five different offensive or defensive plays. In the first game variation, after selecting a play you then control the players on the field. In the second game, you have the option of controller your players after a play is selected or allowing the computer to control the players. The third game has the computer controlling the players at all times and you only need to select the plays you wish it to execute  and indicate when you wish to punt or pass the ball. In all of the game variations the timer begins at 5 minutes, and is active only during plays. Of course, the team with the most points when the timer runs out wins!</desc>

You must make your way two screens to the right to get to your tree. Animals will come at you from either side of the screen. You must either jump over the animal or press your button and push the joystick in the desired direction to chop them with your axe. Snakes cannot be chopped, only jumped over. 

Also to contend with is a bird in the air that is dropping stones. If you are hit by a stone, you will be unable to move for two seconds, which could prove fatal. Once you reach the tree, you must chop it down while still avoiding the animals. It takes four chops per side to fell the tree. If you need to, you can climb the tree to avoid animals. Once the tree is chopped, the game restarts at a faster level. You have only one life so if an animal touches you, it is game over.</desc>

Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.

You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles.

	<desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

	<desc>In Frogger II, you need to guide your frog to safety in three different locations. Starting out underwater, reach the top of the pond while avoiding dangerous alligators and fish (you can ride a turtle for safety!). Once on top of the pond, hop across logs, birds, and even a whale to the life preserver trailing behind a tugboat. In the third location you have to hop across a flock of birds to reach a cloud at the top of the screen. Each frog has a time limit to safely reach one of the homes on each of the three screens. You move on to the next level when a frog has safely reached each of the homes on all screens.

	<desc>S.B.I. (Spectravision Bureau of Investigation) file on Chicago Joe and his gang:
We apprehended Chicago Joe but in retaliation, his gang have holed up in an apartment building, taking hostage a dame and her kid. The following men have been positively identified:

Shifty
2. Scar Face
3. Mugsy
4. Lefty
5. Nitro Ed

Your orders are to snipe any gang member. DO NOT SHOOT AN INNOCENT! Watch out for Nitro Ed. He likes to play with hand grenades. One of those and you're pushing up daisies. Good luck.

You move the joystick to aim at a gangster and push the button to fire. Your ammo is limited so don't fire randomly. Occasionally, Nitro Ed, on the roof, will hold up a grenade. You must shoot him to disarm him. You get money for each gangster shot. The values for level one are:

1. Mugsy=$20
2. Scare Face=$30
3. Lefty=$40
4. Shifty=$50
5. Disarming Nitro Ed=$100

These amounts increase for each level by $10. You also get $10 for each bullet you have left after each level. There are six levels. The fourth level is a nighttime level. In this level, you must fire one bullet to light up the windows. If you do not fire for a couple seconds, they go dark again.
If you shoot an innocent, you will lose $1000 or you total amount if you have less than $1000.

If a gangster rises all the way out of a window, after a couple of seconds, he will shoot you and you will lose one bullet proof vest (life). After you lose all your vests, the game is over and Nitro Ed will laugh at you. If Nitro Ed gets off his hand grenade, no matter how many vests you have, the game is over. And Nitro Ed will laugh at you. You start with four vests and can earn another at $5000.</desc>

	<desc>You are in your vehicle which has terrible fuel efficiency. A real gas hog. You are trying to travel along but there is one or more ships above you that are trying to bomb you. To make things worse, there are holes in the road and other ships you need to shoot so as to not ram them.

As you go along, you can accelerate or decelerate to avoid being bombed but be careful because you might ram some ships near the ground. You can jump to avoid them or blast them for points. You will also see numbers along your way. Run into them to acquire their point value. Do not shoot them or their value will be deducted from you score.

As this is Gas Hog, you will soon run low on fuel. You must get below ground via the occasional holes, to grab a refuel marker. Do not stay below ground, however, as you travel in the wrong direction while there. You start with four lives and lose one if you are hit by a bomb or ship or run out of fuel.</desc>

	<desc>This game has nothing to do with the Atari arcade game or any of the home-ported versions.

You are the great explorer, Sir Robert Wittenbottom. You have discovered an ancient civilization deep within the forest of a mysterious island. Since you're a likable old fellow, they have decided to induct you into their council of warriors. But first you must prove your worthiness by running the gauntlet.

You are given three glasses of water. You must run through the gauntlet to the ceremonial fires and use your water to put them out. You current glass of water will then be refilled then it is off to the next fire.

Of course, it is not that easy. You must jump over rocks and logs, duck under stones, arrows and tomahawks, and avoid hitting trees or touching the sides of the gauntlet.You can ease the thirst of the old men you come across for points but it will cost you water. The game is over when you run out of your third glass of water. To jump, just press the fire button. To duck, pull back then press the fire button.

Scoring:
Jump over a rock or a log=50 points
Duck under an arrow, stone or tomahawk=100 points
Give an old man a drink of water=250 points
Duck under the Secret Talisman=500 points
Extinguish the ceremonial flame=500 points

	<desc>Your friend is trapped inside Ghost Manor! There are five different screens you need to get past before you can rescue your friend from the top floor of the manor. The game begins in the graveyard outside the manor; here you play tag with a friendly rainbow ghost or skeleton which will supply you with spears you can fire at enemies. In the second screen, you approach the guarded entrance of the manor. Using the spears you collected, you need to shoot all of the enemies blocking the entrance. The third and fourth screens take place inside the manor; each floor has a set of stairs as well as several treasures and crosses which can be collected. There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>
	<path>./Ghostbusters (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

	<path>./Glib - Video Word Game (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600.

The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.

Difficulty switches
Use the left switch to set the number of players; B for one player, A for two.

Game variations
There are five games, each with five skill levels.
The skill levels differ by the amount of time you have to make words.
Skill levels for one player games:
Skill level 1=unlimited time (no clock)
Skill level 2=132 seconds
Skill level 3=39 seconds
Skill level 4=26 seconds
Skill level 5=random times
For two player games, the times are half of what they are in one player.

The games are:
Game 1 (Billboard): After each round, all the letters are reshuffled, so you get a whole new set of seven letters. Any letters that were not used go back into the mix.
Game 2 (Skill Builder): Only the letters you used to make the word are replaced. Any unused letters stay on the top spaces.
Game 3 (Times Up): You are given seven letters only. You must use these seven to make as many words as you can.
Game 4 (Encore): The letters on the top row all shift to the right, with the last letter disappearing and a new letter plopping into the first spot. You must grab you letters and place them quickly. Any letters the you don't use will reappear randomly again.
Game 5 (Over the Edge): Same as game 4 but letters that disappear never return.</desc>

	<path>./Golf (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Golf features a nine hole, par 36 course which can be played by one or two players. The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.</desc>

	<desc>A pesky gopher is after your carrot patch! Your goal is to stop it before all of your carrots are gone. The gopher will be tunneling in the ground at the bottom of the screen; you are at the top and need to fill in the gophers tunnels with your shovel. The gopher is fast, however, and if you don't fill in the tunnels quick enough it will make it to the surface and run off with one of your carrots! If the gopher manages to take all of your carrots, the game will be over. From time to time there will be a duck that flies overhead. As the duck passes by, it will drop a seed; if you catch the seed and plant it, a new carrot will grow to replace one of the ones that was stolen. Several difficulty levels are included, which control the speed and intelligence of the gopher, and whether or not the duck will appear.</desc>
	<path>./Gorf (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Gorf is a game similar to Space Invaders, alien vessels approach closer and closer in their threatening row formation.

The game itself consists of four levels:

1. The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship &amp; shield on one side and the aliens on the other side;

The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;

The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading "towards" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;

The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.

Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.</desc>

You pilot your sub through a maze, avoiding touching the deadly walls. Your goal is to reach the treasure chest at the end of the maze. Don't let the octopus completely cover your sub or you will die. Be aware that the octopus will slow you down so be prepared for a burst of speed once you are past.

The two player game, dubbed GoSub 500 by the creators, is a counter-clockwise race around an oval track. First to cross the finish line wins.</desc>

	<desc>Grand Prix is an action racing game for one player. The game is played with an overhead view of the racetrack which scrolls horizontally. Your goal is to reach the finish line in the shortest possible time on one of the four different tracks included. Of course, there will be obstacles on the tracks which will slow you down if you're not careful. Numerous other cars will often get in your way, oil slicks will cause you to temporarily lose control, and on the more difficulty tracks narrow bridges will cause you to come to a complete stop if you miss the path.</desc>
	<path>./Gravitar (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.</desc>

You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</desc>

As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

	<desc>Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the  four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.

The mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!

You are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn, you will need to put down the scepter so be careful! You win the game when all three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the better the score!</desc>
	<path>./Holey Moley (USA) (Proto).bin</path>
	<desc>It's video Whack-A-Mole!

Each round consists of twenty-five moles. When a mole pops out of his hole, press the corresponding button on the Kid's Controller to whack it. The faster you hit him, the more points you'll get. If the King Mole pops up, whack him for even higher points. Beware of the acorn. If it pops up, don't whack it as it will cost you points. You must score at least three hundred points by the time the mole count reaches zero. If you reach or exceed three hundred points in one round, any points beyond three hundred will be added to your score as a bonus. If you fail to score three hundred points in one round, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Home Run (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base. 

The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</desc>
	<path>./Human Cannonball (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land in a bucket of water. To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.</desc>

The gameplay in question involves a progression through 14 levels 
of platforming to impress Esmeralda, climbing up and down ladders to gather bells while avoiding guards and a regular stream of missiles being fired in from the sides.

	<desc>Hunt &amp; Score is similar to the game Memory. The player is presented with a numbered grid; behind each grid section is a picture. On each turn, the player chooses two grid sections in an attempt to find two matching pictures. Points are earned for finding matching pictures, and the player with the most points at the end wins. Several game options include a 16 or 30 square game grid, the ability to handicap one of the players, and the ability to enable or disable wild cards.</desc>

At any given time one player is active and can be controlled while the other remains inactive; if the puck is near your goal then the defensive player becomes active, otherwise you control the offensive player. Each player has the ability to shoot the puck at a variety of angles, and can even body check their opponent! The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player more of an advantage.</desc>

In the two player game, the first player to complete 25 laps wins! Included are several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and additional game variations called ice race, tag, and crash 'n score. In ice race, the track is icy causing your car to slide often and making it difficulty to steer.  In tag, one player is "it" and needs to tag the other player. For each second you race without being tagged, a point is earned. Lastly, in crash 'n score the goal is to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the track.</desc>
	<path>./Infiltrate (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are a secret agent sent on an important mission to recover enemy documents. There are enemy assassins trying to stop you.

You move the joystick to move your character, left or right. Press the button to fire. You fire in the direction you are moving. When you are next to an elevator, you will automatically board it when it gets to your level unless your are pushing towards it, in which case you will walk across it. 

If you are on the same level with an assassin and there is no elevator between you, you can shoot him. If he shoots at you, you can pull down on the joystick to duck. You cannot shoot while ducked. If the assassin shoots or touches you, you lose a life.

Difficulty switch
A=Enemy shots travel the length of the screen
B=Enemy shots only travel half the screen's length

Scoring
Agent travels all floor levels, top to bottom or bottom to top=3,000 points
Shooting an assassin=250 points
Assassin is riding elevator when shot=75 bonus points added to assassin shooting points

You get an extra agent every 10,000 points.

You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</desc>
	<path>./Joust (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>

	<desc>Jr. Pac-Man features gameplay similar to the original Pac-Man, but with a few changes. As Jr., you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.</desc>

The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines without plummeting to your doom? The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river. Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with. Don't forget to go up for air! In the third part, you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics. Once you've cleared all these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked spear. Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?

Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile phase). The view is always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.</desc>

It was discovered in 2000 and improved upon a little before being released to the public in ROM format. Kabobbers are strange (but cute) little creatures who just love wreaking havoc. Your objective is to send in your Buvskies to krush the Kabobbers before they krush you. You can have up to nine Buvskies onscreen at one time, but you have reserves waiting offscreen should one get krushed. You move your Bruvskies across the grid, jumping on enemy Kabobbers in order to defeat them and earn additional reserve Bruvskies. The baby Bruvskies become big ones when they defeat an enemy. The enemies get tougher and tougher, meaning very good timing is required in the later stages. Above all, you must reach Princess Buvsky before she reaches the rainbow energy at the other end of the level and devours it. A very unique game, but also somewhat fun.</desc>

Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</desc>

You fly above your town's forcefield. Satellites will drop from the sky and show on the radar area at the screen top. You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the ability to penetrate the town's shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town's shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram into one.</desc>

You must make your way across the floors and up the ladders while jumping over bombs for points and holes in the floor. There is also a timer in the upper right. It starts at nine-hundred ninety and counts down ten points per second. If you are hit by a bomb or fall through a hole in the floor or the time reaches zero, you lose a life.

	<path>./Krull (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Krull is a multi part action game based on the movie of the same name. A beast and his army have traveled through space until finally landing on the distant planet of Krull and ravaging the entire planet. But there is a prophecy which tells of a king and queen who will someday take back the planet. These future rulers are Princess Lyssa and Prince Colwyn. But before their marrage, Princess Lyssa is captured by the beast! 

You play the part of Prince Colwyn on a mission to rescue Lyssa and destroy the beast. The game is divided up into several parts.

The first part takes place during the foiled wedding. A large number of slayers arrive at the castle, and you need to defeat as many as you can to earn points. But eventually Princess Lyssa is captured.

In the next section you need to ride your horse towards the Widow's web; on the way you can collect Glaives which may be used to fight the beast. Once you reach the web, you need to make your way to the cocoon at the top of the web in order to find the correct path to the Black Fortress. The crystal spider along with strands of the web make maneuvering your way around this screen a challenge. Once you know the correct path, you ride on to the Black Fortress. 

Here you need to use the Glaives you've collected to free the Princess from a prison, and then destroy the beast! After successfully completing all tasks, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.</desc>
	<path>./Lady Bug (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>An action game in the same style as Pac-Man but very very different. Players control a ladybug who must venture around different mazes collecting all of the food pellet "x"'s. In addition to there being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game.  In the center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned every time the border around the screen makes a complete "lap". Timers for the border vary upon the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.

In addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses. However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to that colour's word. The red word is "SPECIAL" and the yellow word is "EXTRA". Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus round.

Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the X's being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player dies, but letter powerups are not.</desc>

	<desc>Laser Gates is a side scrolling shooter. Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the force fields.</desc>

As you run through the maze, you have the ability to temporarily close a door in an attempt to block the police. You can only close two doors at a time, and any closed doors automatically open again after a short amount of time. When all of the gold in the maze has been collected, the exit to the vault will open and you can escape and move on to the next, more difficult vault.

On orange bombs, what slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb and on blue bombs, you can't control the switches. They just randomly change and you push right and hope you disarm in time.

The possible ranks are:
Lance Corporal
Corporal
Sargent
Staff Sargent
Warrant Officer
Second Lieutenant
First Lieutenant
Captain

At the start of the game, you can select which rank to start at, from Lance Corporal to Second Lieutenant on the C64 or from Lance Corporal to First Lieutenant on the Atari 2600.

Every time you disarm a bomb, you move up levels within your rank. Move up eight levels and you are promoted. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage, you are demoted a level in rank.

You lose the game is you are demoted below Lance Corporal or a bomb explodes while you are near it, a not-very-healthy thing to happen.

You win if you get promoted to Captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.</desc>

	<desc>You are at the airport attempting to collect your luggage from the carousel. However, the carousel has gone out of control and is tossing luggage everywhere! You need to catch all of the luggage that is tossed out, or all of your clothes will be scattered around the airport. As the levels progress, more and more luggage will need to be caught, and the games speed increases. There are two difficulty levels available; the easier mode gives you two men to catch luggage with, and the harder mode gives you only one man. Several other game variations are also available: if the terrorist suitcase option is enabled, explosive suitcases will occasionally appear. If you don't catch these, the game immediately ends regardless of how many lives you have left. If the suitcase control option is enabled during a two player game, you are able to control the direction your opponents suitcases travel.</desc>

	<desc>M.A.D. (which stands for Missile Attack and Defense) is an arcade action game somewhat similar to Missile Command. You control a photon cannon at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to protect six energy stations located to your left and right. Waves of rockets and other ships will fly by on the screen, and occasionally one will drop in an attempt to destroy one of the stations (as a warning on most levels, the enemy will turn white just before it drops). You need to make sure you shoot it before your energy station is destroyed! When all six energy stations are gone, the game is over. A two player variation is also included; one player will control the photon cannon, and the second player controls a cursor and can select when and where an enemy will drop. The players alternate between offense and defense in this version.</desc>
	<path>./M.A.S.H (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>M*A*S*H was one of the many attempts by various software companies to take a successful movie or television show and convert it into a playable game.

In this game, you play the role of "Hawkeye Pierce," a surgeon stationed at the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital #4077 during the Korean War (1950-1953). There are two main stages in the game, each of which you must pass to move to the next round. The first mission involves rescuing injured soldiers from the battlefield with your helicopter and returning them to home base without being shot down by enemy tanks. The second mission takes place in the operating room while you are required to carefully remove bullets and shrapnel from wounded soldiers... it is very similar to the classic "OPERATION" tweezers game by Milton Bradley.

Each set of missions are repeated four times. The first player to reach 999 points wins the game. There are four different variations of games, each selectable as either one player (against the computer) or two-player mode.</desc>

	<desc>You are Commander Harrington "Harry" Crag of the starship "Endless Search". You are put into a Malagai base for repairs but now the Malagai are holding you ransom. They want your advanced technology.

There are three airlock doors per starbase. You must get the correct key for each door. Each is held by one of three Malagai. The order of which Malagai is holding which key is shown by the pictures above the starbase.

If you are away from your assigned compartment for too long, as indicated by the line at the bottom of the screen, the Malagai will attack and you will need to return to your compartment to make them friendly again. When you touch a Malagai and, if it is the correct one, get the airlock door key, the Malagai will attack and the airlock will flash, on most game variations (see below). You must then make your way to the airlock. One door will disappear and the Malagai will become friendly again. After you open the third door, it is off to the next starbase.

After the third (blue) starbase, you get an extra man.

Game Variations:
Version 1: All the Malagai have different shapes and colors
Version 2: All the Malagai have the same shape but different colors
Version 3: All Malagai are the same shape and color and the airlocks do not blink to show you got the right key.

Scoring:
Touch a Malagai while they're friendly=100 points (50 point bonus if it has the correct key)
Open airlocks one or two=100 points
Open airlock three to exit starbase orange or teal=150 points
Open airlock three to exit blue starbase=250 points

Difficulty switches set to "B"=10 seconds from compartment before Malagai attack

	<desc>Mama Mia! That's a  lots a pasta!

Mama brings pasta to the table. You must either eat the pasta, toss it to Frankie the cat when he is at the window, or toss it to Sergio the dog when he is under the table.

You have four lives. If you eat more than 20 plates of pasta, you will burst (literally) and lose 1 life. If more than 9 plates of pasta are placed on the table, it will collapse and you will lose 1 life.

To eat pasta, you move the joystick to the right then the left. To toss pasta to a pet, you move the joystick to the right then up or down in one smooth motion. You must throw when Mama's back is turned and the cat is in the window or the dog is in the right spot under the table. If you throw food at the floor or window when the pet is not in position or if Mama sees you throw food to a pet, she will bring 3 plates the next time. Remember, over nine plates on the table and it is arrivederci una vita (goodbye one life).

To clear a level, you must eat or toss a certain number of plates of pasta.
1=31
2=32
3=35
4=37
5=40
6=42
7=45
8=47
9=49

The point value of each plate of pasta starts at 5 at level 1 and increases by 1 point per level, to a maximum of 13 at level 9.
You get an extra life at every 1,000 points. The highest points you can reach is 9,999.</desc>

You start on the right side of a room, randomly selected. You must make your way though various rooms, killing or avoiding the four robots as you go. You need to find the power center and shoot it to clear that level. You must do this before the timer at the bottom runs out. Once you shoot the power center, you will get the remaining time as bonus. You are then sent to a new room to start again but now there are five robots per room. Get the power center again and there will be six per room. Get the power center again and you return to four robots per room but faster. In some rooms, you will randomly find a magic armor that will make you invulnerable for a short time.</desc>

	<desc>Bounty Bob has tracked Yukon Yohan into Nuclear Ned's uranium mine. Bob must 'claim' each section of each part of the mine...but cannot take too long in each area, or the radiation will kill him.

Taking the role of Bob, players must traverse through different types of areas inside the nuclear mine. In the first level, "Lift", Bob must walk on each part of the screen to 'claim' it. Avoid the monsters by jumping over them or grab an old miner possession to become energized and grab a mutant for points. Use the lift to reach the higher parts of the screen.

The next area is the Crusher, with the same goal as Lift but more challenging as the player must also avoid getting crushed. The last part is the Radioactive Waste, where the goal is again the same, but the player must maneuver Bob around the radioactive waste. In each screen, there is a timer in the upper right. If this timer reached zero before you claim all sections, you lose a life.

After you have beaten all three screens, they repeat but without any of the bonuses for energizing, so you must jump over or avoid all mutants.</desc>

	<desc>You are the last mining robot on the Minos mine. Monsters have destroyed all your comrades.

As the last robot, you must traverse the mine's various levels, gathering spare parts to make more robots (extra lives). You must either avoid the monsters or blow them up with a bomb. After a few seconds, if the monster hasn't hit the bomb, it will explode harmlessly. You can only drop one bomb at a time. If a monster is killed, it will regenerate somewhere in the maze.

To deposit your spare parts, you must get to the center top or bottom of any level. To move to another level, hold your joystick button down while moving through the tunnels on either side. You can also use these tunnels, without holding down the button, to quickly get from left or right side of the maze to avoid monsters.

To win the game, get to level five and ram each of the three stationary monsters to kill them. You will need at least two spare robots as the ramming will destroy you and the monster.

In two player games, player one is the robot, player two is a monster. If the robot runs into the monster being controlled, the monster is destroyed instead of the robot. However, by pushing the joystick button, player two can switch to another monster, allowing the robot to run into an uncontrolled (and therefore deadly) monster.

As in a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the "cup."  Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated.

Rather than a full 18 holes, this Miniature Golf variation has a nine-hole half-course. Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the cup. The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes. While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it. So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole.

Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.</desc>

If anything gets through, one of your cities could be destroyed. When all of the cities are gone, the game is over. On each level you have a limited amount of ammo, so make sure most (if not all) of your shots are accurate or you could run out of ammo and leave your cities at risk! As the levels progress, there are more and more enemy weapons to destroy which come in at an increasingly faster rate.</desc>

The player controls a cursor on the screen which indicates the direction of fire for the defense missiles. Once launched, they travel in a straight line from the launcher through the point the player specified until they hit an object. Each level is won by destroying all alien spaceships. The player loses once all their cities are destroyed. Bonus cities can be obtained by destroying a sufficient number of alien spacecraft.

The game gets progressively harder, for example bombs will fall faster and energy barriers might protect the aliens from the player's attacks. To get around the barriers, players can deflect their shots from large defense missiles launched at the sides of the screen.</desc>

In the main view, the Thunderhawk is visible at the center of the screen which will scroll to follow your movement. To destroy the starbases and numerous attacking starfighters, the Thunderhawk is equipped with lasers which can be fired in eight different directions.

	<desc>Motocross is a motorcycle racing game viewed from a top-down perspective. The player rides a bike against an endless number of opponents on a straight road, trying to avoid running into them. In addition, the player has to watch the amount of gas left in the tank. The fuel gauge can be restored by driving over fuel cans. The goal of the game is to overtake a specified amount of bikes. Once this is accomplished, a new "scene" starts, and the difficulty is increased.</desc>
	<path>./Motocross Racer (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Motocross Racer is a bike racing game where you need to race through three different scenes in the shortest amount of time possible. Each scene takes place in a different location with a different perspective. First you will race through the desert with a 3-D behind the bike point of view. Rocks, cacti, scorpions, and other obstacles should be avoided or you'll crash and lose valuable time. Next you'll race a winding path uphill through the woods. This section has a top down view, and you'll lose time if you wander off the track or crash into obstacles. The final segment of the race takes place on the beach with a side scrolling point of view. Various obstacles and other racers will all get in your way here! If you crash too many times, or take too long the game will be over.</desc>
	<path>./MotoRodeo (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>This is a monster truck race that features true split screen action on an Atari 2600.

First, you move the joystick(s) up or down to select if this opponent will be a human player or computer, a blazer or a truck and whether it will have tires or trax. Tires allow you to go over obstacles easier, trax make you bounce higher. Then on the next screen, you select weather you are going to do a competition at hard, medium or easy or whether you are going to practice one of the obstacles in the game.

Press the joystick button to accelerate. Move the joystick down to do a wheelie when on the ground. Move the joystick left and right when in the air to control your spin. Move the joystick left and right quickly to escape mud bogs. Press the joystick button and push forward to use a nitro burst if you collected them.

Difficulty switches
Only the left switch is used.
Set it to A for a scoring game in which the player with the most points at the end of the race wins.
Set it to B for a timing race in which the first player across the finish line wins.

Scoring
If the difficulty switch is set to A, the scoring is as follows:
Landing upright and flat from a jump=5 points
Hit a wall=10 points
Crush a car=20 points
Bounce on truck tires on the platform=25 points
Jump to a collapsed ramp=25 points
Touching 50 on the screen=50 points
Finish the race first=100 points</desc>

	<desc>Deep within a multi platformed diamond mine is a valuable crown. Your goal is to locate and retrieve the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!</desc>

The mouse can move these doors to reconfigure the maze in an attempt to outsmart the cats.</desc>
	<path>./Mr. Do! (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You control Mr. Do has he tries to harvest all of the cherries on the screen. However, there are numerous bad guys out to get him! Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

The mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.</desc>
	<path>./Mr. Do!'s Castle (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Mr. Do!'s Castle is an action platform game which has you in a castle consisting of several floors, each of which contain a variety of blocks. You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles. 

There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. 

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.</desc>

	<desc/>
	<path>./Ms. Pac-Man (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

Each time an octopus tentacle touches the bottom of the screen, or the shark catches you some of your treasure will be lost. To deal with these creatures, your diver has a harpoon. You need to make sure that you shoot the shark before it can make it's way to the bottom of the screen and catch you (the shark will appear again at the top of the screen each time it is shot.) The octopus' tentacles will be reaching downward; each time a tentacle is shot it will retreat back to the top so you need to keep shooting the tentacles before one can reach the bottom. Of course, your diver has a limited air supply. Your companion is in a boat on the surface, and will occasionally drop an air line down. You need to catch this to replenish your air before it runs out (if you run out of air, some treasure will be lost). The game ends when you have lost all of your treasure.</desc>

The objective of the game is to help Asterix "stun" Roman soldiers (simply by running into them, and they turn white from blue) while you command good ol'Obelix to throws his oversized Menhirs down at stunned Romans with a splat.

If by any chance a stunned soldier is not whacked by a flying menhir, they turn "red" and hostile, which means Asterix is in trouble. In any case, he needs some good ol' magic potion from Getafix in order to defeat the "red" Romans, so be ready to catch some when Getafix comes knocking.

There are 2 types of Roman soldiers to thump: the fat legionnaires and the small centurions. Centurions are worth more points.</desc>

You control Kung Fu Lu, whose mission is to destroy a mysterious, evil wall by reflecting a bouncing ball into the bricks that make up the wall. When the bricks are hit by the ball, they are destroyed. On the top of the screen is a mystical dragon which guards the wall. Each level can be completed by either destroying all of the bricks in the wall, or hitting the dragon six times with the ball. Once the first level is completed, a blackbird will also appear on screen just below the wall. The blackbird will deflect the ball, and tries to get in the way to make your mission more difficult. From time to time, a magic token will fall downward which gives you special powers if caught. These can make the ball magnetic and follow your player, give you a larger paddle, or make the ball explosive and take out larger chunks of bricks. You start the game at a skill level of Peasant, and advance in rank every time four waves of bricks are cleared. You lose a life every time the ball falls off the bottoms of the screen, and the game ends when you lose all five of your lives.</desc>

The wolf is at the bottom of the screen and will blow a hole in the house one section at a time. Each time a hole is formed, the pig must patch it up quickly so the wolf can't get in. New materials are located at the top of the screen, and you need to grab them and place them in the holes as they are formed. The longer you last, the tougher the wolf will become! You start the game controlling the pig whose house is made of straw; when he is caught, you move on to the pig in the house made of sticks. Finally you will control the pig in the house made of bricks. When all three pigs have been caught by the wolf, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Okie Dokie (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>Okie Dokie is a puzzle game where you are to clear the screen of all the items. You do this by clicking the item to 'flip' it to off. But things are not as easy as that. When you flip an item, the spaces above, below, to the left and to the right of it are reversed. If the items in those spaces were on, they turn off but if the items in those spaces were off, they turn back on. Try to clear the screen in the fewest moves.</desc>
	<path>./Omega Race (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game.  You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you.  Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too.  The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</desc>
	<path>./Open Sesame (Europe).bin</path>
	<desc>Open, Sesame! is an action platform game. You control Ali Baba, and your goal is to reach the cave of treasures. The treasury entrance is at the top of the screen, and you begin each level at the bottom and need to climb your way up. To do so, you will need to find a good location where you can throw a rope up to the next platform and climb up (there will be a dot on the platform where you can safely throw a rope, two on each floor). Before the treasury can be entered, you need to attach ropes to each of the possible locations. To hinder your progress, there are guards wandering each of the floors. If you're caught, you'll lose a life! To help out, a magic ball will appear on screen from time to time; if caught, this can be used to temporarily freeze a guard. When you successfully enter the treasury, you then move on to the next level of gameplay.</desc>
	<path>./Oscar's Trash Race (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>It is the Grouch Day Picnic and three little grouches (Herman, Grungetta and Sloppy) want to win the Trash Race.

Game one is a practice race. The trash truck dumps one to five items. One of the trash cans at the top will then have a number on it. Press the button on the controller for that can the use the arrow keys to move it to the trash. Once you get the trash, move the grouch back to the top. You get one point per race. There are three races per game then Oscar appears to congratulate the winner (in his own grouchy way).

Game two is the same as game one except there will be a number on all three trash cans and you must select the one that corresponds to the number of items.

Both games one and two are one player only.

In games three and four, the truck dumps one to nine items. You again select the correct grouch but this time there are puddles, three in game three, several in game four. You get one point for each puddle you jump. If you step into a puddle, the grouch will play in it, delaying you. There are three races in game three, five in game four.

In game five, you run races one after another until Slimey the inchworm gets from one side of the screen to the other. Once Slimey get to the other side, the races ends. There are several puddles. You get one point per puddle jumped and one point per race completed.

Games six and seven are the same as five but it will rain sometimes. When it does, the puddles turn blue. If you jump a blue puddle, you get two points.

The trash items are:
bones
hangers
coffee mugs
toothbrush (presumably used)
old tin can
old televisions
old ten-gallon hats
old telephones
old tennis shoes
old dress shoes
junk mail
scissors
old toy boats
hammers

	<desc>Othello is a conversion of the board game. Each player tries to fill the game board with as many discs of his color as possible. On each turn the player places a disc on the board by selecting a location where the opponents discs will become trapped between two of his discs. The trapped discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when the board is filled or time runs out, and the player with the greatest number of his color discs on the board wins. Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.</desc>
	<path>./Out of Control (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>This is an obstacle race in a space ship. The ship controls in a rather Asteroids-like way, in that you push left or right to rotate and press fire to thrust. Once you stop thrusting, the ship does not immediately stop, although it will slow down on its own. To stop sooner, you have to face away from the direction you are traveling and thrust.

First, you must pass a set number of hurdles. If there is a single hurdle, you must pass on the side indicated by the arrow. If there are two hurdles, you must pass in between them. If there are three, you can pass through them or go around. If you hit a hurdle, you must go back to the last successfully passed hurdle and do it again to continue.

After the hurdles, you must pop ten space balloons by running in to them. They appear one at a time at random spots on the screen. After you pop all ten balloons, you must dock in the space dock to end the race.

The difficulty switches are not used. You select your game variation by moving the joystick up or down.

Game variations
There are 28 variations. The odd numbered ones have fast maneuvering, the even numbered ones, slow.

The number of hurdles also varies. The first two have 10 hurdles, the next two, 14, then 22 (twice), 27 (twice), 35 (twice), 39 (four times), 47 (twice), 51 (twice), 54 (twice), 63 (twice), 64 (twice), 72 (twice), and 82 (twice).</desc>

In the two player version, each player tries to be the first to shoot his opponent ten times. Several game variations are included in both the one and two player versions. In the middle of the screen is one of several possible obstacles to make the game more difficult. A giant cactus, a stagecoach, a moving stagecoach, or a breakable wall all can block the target or provide some shelter for you to hide from your opponents shots. You also have the choice of unlimited fire, or only a six shooter. If you choose the six shooter, then each player must use up all six shots before either player can reload. And lastly, there is the "getaway" option. With getaway, a player may move immediately after firing; without getaway, a player must remain stationary for as long as his bullet is on the screen.</desc>

	<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

	<path>./Phantom Tank (Europe).bin</path>
	<desc>In Phantom-Panzer, the player takes control of an assault vehicle in order to defend their "energy base" at the bottom of the screen from the attacking phantom tanks.

The game consists of three phases: the first phase takes place in a city and looks like a maze. It offers relative protection with the building walls. The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there's practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it's an all-out battle with the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player's base and no obstacles to stop them.

The player can only shoot one bullet at a time and has to destroy 20 tanks in each stage. Enemy bullets can be canceled by hitting them with one's own bullet. The player loses one life if they collide with one of the tanks or the enemy bullets. The game is over immediately, however, if an enemy tank or shell hits the player's energy base.</desc>

	<path>./Phaser Patrol (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Phaser Patrol you are the pilot of an interstellar spaceship on a mission to defend the Human Federation from the deadly Dracon armada. Gameplay is similar to Star Raiders. You begin with a view of the sector map, and need to warp to a sector where the Dracon are located. Once you've reached your destination, the game switches to a first person point of view where you need to destroy all enemy fighters located in the sector. Once the sector is cleared, you can return to the sector map and warp to a new location. The mission is successful when all sectors containing enemy fighters have been cleared. Your ship has a limited amount of energy; energy is depleted by warping to new sectors, or by taking damage from enemy fighters. If your energy runs out the game is over, however you can recharge your ship by visiting one of the friendly starbases that are located throughout the galaxy (visiting a starbase will also repair any equipment that has been damaged, such as the photon torpedoes or sector scanner).  The game is timed, and the faster you can complete your mission the better your ranking at the end will be!</desc>

You are the commander of the Phoenix, and your mission is to reach an alien spaceship which has been draining your planets resources. The ship is guarded by four levels of bird like creatures. After clearing all four stages, the fifth level will be against a large, heavily shielded mothership. If the mothership is destroyed, the game will then repeat, but with increased speed and difficulty. To defeat the numerous enemies, the Phoenix is equipped with a laser cannon and a force field.</desc>
	<path>./Pick 'n' Pile (Europe).bin</path>
	<desc>Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.

In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</desc>
	<path>./Pick Up (USA) (Proto).bin</path>
	<desc>OK, here's the deal. If you want that lover of your dreams to get off their pedestal and go out with you, you need to present them with the right gifts. Then you can head over to the Love Nest Hotel to really score!

You start with your lover of a pedestal on the left and various items floating above you. You must shoot each item once to acquire it. If an item starts flashing, shoot it next because after a short time, you'll lose a chance. If you shoot an item a second time, you will lose it and a chance. Lose all your chances and the game is over. If you collect all the items needed, head over to the pedestal then head off the screen to the right. Head to the door of the hotel and the hotel sign will say how many times you have scored. Now head left to start the next level.</desc>
	<path>./Picnic (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are out enjoying a picnic, when suddenly a swarm of flies arrive! You control a fly swatter at the bottom of the screen; your goal in this game is to protect your hamburgers (located on the left and right bottom of the screen) from the attacking flies. When a fly is close enough, it will stick out its tongue to eat the food. If you can swat the fly right when it has its tongue out, it will be knocked out and fall into your fly trap. When all of the flies have been knocked into the trap, you will then need to face a large super fly before the level is complete (be careful, it can eat your food fast!) After knocking out the super fly, you move on to the next round. The game ends when all of your hamburgers have been completely eaten.</desc>
	<path>./Piece o' Cake (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Piece o' Cake you are a chef, and your goal is to successfully build cakes! At the bottom of the screen is a conveyor belt, and a platter will appear at the left side moving towards the right. You are at the top of the screen, and need to take cake layers from the oven and drop them onto the platter. The cake layers are different sizes, and you must drop them such that each layer is the same size or smaller than the one beneath it. After you have created a cake, you need to top it off with a cherry. If you are unable to successfully create a cake with the layers in the proper order and a topped with a cherry before the platter reaches the right side of the screen, it will fall off the conveyor and you lose a life. The different size cake layers come out of the oven randomly, so if you get a size you don't want it can be dropped off at the right side of the screen until a layer you do want appears. Although you can build cakes of different sizes, bonus points are earned for building a perfect cake consisting of one large layer, one medium layer, one small layer, and a cherry. As the game progresses, the conveyor will pick up speed to make cake building tougher.</desc>

The direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life.

Scoring
You get one point for every mile you get through the mine.
Hitting a Gonzoid=100 points

Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint.</desc>

Your ship flies to the left, while you control you up and down motion. Initially, you must shoot the oncoming lager, red ships but avoid the smaller, blue missiles. Do not shoot the black ship. Dock with it so you can land and refuel later. When you come to the three enemy fuel depots, shoot each one to destroy it then make your way through a mine field to continue. If you come to the landing strip, just align your ship with it to land and a refueling truck will top off your tanks. As you move into night, the enemy ships become too dark to see. You can then create light, temporarily, by firing off shots.</desc>
	<path>./Plaque Attack (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Plaque Attack, your goal is to protect a mouthful of teeth from a variety of incoming foods! You control a tube of fluoride toothpaste, and you need to shoot the attacking foods before they can decay the teeth located at the top and bottom of the screen. Hamburgers, hot dogs, gum drops, strawberries, donuts, ice cream cones and more will all appear from the sides of the screen and make their way towards the teeth. If a food item reaches a tooth and is allowed to remain there for too long, the tooth will decay and disappear. The game ends when all of the teeth have decayed and disappeared.</desc>
	<path>./Pleiades (USA) (Proto).bin</path>
	<desc>This is a sequel to Phoenix. 

On the first screen, you must shoot swooping aliens while not getting shot by them.

	<desc>This is a game of polo, played on horseback. You move your horse with the joystick. The mallet swings automatically and will always send the ball in the direction of the opposing goal. The object is simply to to get the ball through the opposing player's goal more than they get the ball through yours. Some game variations have the ball wrap around the screen, some make the ball bounce off the sides, some give each player one horse to control, some two apiece.</desc>
	<path>./Pooyan (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home. Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground. If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig. But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig. But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too. If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit. Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair. Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall. Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present. Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</desc>

	<desc>Popeye is a conversion of the arcade action/platform game. As Popeye, you are trying to win Olive Oyl's love! She is at the top of the screen dropping tokens of her love, and you need to collect them before they hit the ground. After you have collected the required number of items, you can move on to the next, more difficult level. There are many obstacles trying to stop you from completing your task, though! Brutus wanders around the screen and is constantly trying to catch you. If you collect a can of spinach, you can temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus will knock you out. Other objects such as bottles or birds are also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of your lives if you are hit. Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!</desc>

Porky's Bar
-----------------
After you get all the way to the top, you enter Porky's Bar, where you have to travel the correct path up the scaffolding, planting charges as you go. If you get to the top, there will be a detonator and so long Porky's! If you fall and Porky catches you, it is off to the swamp.

Porky catches you=lose 200 points
What points you get for exiting the scaffolding depends on the difficulty you have set the game to. The points are from 100 to 3200.

The Swamp
-----------------
If you get caught on any other screen, you end up here. You must pole vault up and release when in mid-flight to get up to one of the platforms.

The first time you are there, you have to collect bricks then place then on the wall on the other side until you can climb out. 

If you are sent to the swamp a second time, you can climb out right away but look out for Porky.

Place a brick=100 points
Getting out of the swamp screen=100 points
Each pole vault jump=lose 25 points
Falling into swamp=lose 100 points
Caught by Porky=lose a random number of points

The Shower
-------------------
Push the random object that appears at center, top into the pit at the bottom without getting caught by Ms. Balbricker or falling in the pit the climb out the top back to the county line. Every time you get through the shower, you stop or slow a lane on the highway.

You get 100 points for pushing an object into the pit.
You lose 200 points if you fall in the pit or are caught by Ms. Balbricker.
Every ten seconds you are in the shower, you lose ten points so don't dawdle.

	<desc>You are Brian Mareck. Your father created a super computer to help mankind but when it was switched on, something went wrong. You must deactivate the computer, but beware of the robots that have been reprogrammed to protect the computer at all costs. You must run and climb ladders to get to the 'power pills' and deactivate them. Avoid the robots as they will kill you. Once you have deactivated all the 'power pills' in that part of the lab (level), it is off to the next.</desc>
	<path>./Pressure Cooker (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Pressure Cooker, you are a cook whose job is to fullfill hamburger orders at "The Grille". Along the bottom of the screen you will see the orders for various types of hamburgers come in. Tomotoes, onions, lettuce, and cheese may all be requested and you need to collect the proper ingredients, put them on a hamburger, and drop it in the wrapping machine. The hamburgers will be coming down the left side of the screen on a conveyer belt as all other ingredients come flying out of the dispensers on the right. Make sure you catch all the ingredients and don't let any hamburgers fall off the end of the conveyer belt, otherwise you'll lose performance points! If your performance score drops to zero, you will be fired and the game ends. Of course, the ingredients will rarely come out in the desired order, so you also have the ability to toss an ingredient back without losing performance points if necessary. As you successfully create the ordered hamburgers and drop them in the proper warpping machine, the game difficulty will increase by upping the speed of the conveyer belt and increasing the complexity of the orders.</desc>
	<path>./Pressure Gauge (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>Pressure Guage's gameplay is a simple as its graphics, albeit not that easy to describe. On the left of the screen is a small colored line. On the right is a line that starts at the top of the screen and slowly descends. This is your timer. Next to the left line is a line that starts at the bottom and rises to the top. When it reaches the top, it restarts at the bottom. The object is to press your button when the rising line on the left is within the small line on the left. This will cause a new line to rise. If you press the button when the rising line is not in the left small line or let the rising line reach the top, the new line will lower. To clear the level, get the new line all the way to the top. If you do not get the new line to the top before the descending line on the right reaches the bottom, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Private Eye (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are the great French private eye Pierre Touche. Your job is to capture the criminal Henri Le Fiend and send him to jail. To do this, you will first need to find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you: questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for! If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum, or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks so there will be a greater area to search! In addition to the various cases, several difficulty settings are included which control the speed of your car and how high you can jump.</desc>
	<path>./Qb (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>Explaining Qb is simple, even if achieving your goal proves not to be. You must slide blocks in the left playing field to match the pattern in the right field. You can jump from block to block, as long as they are adjacent. When you land on a block with fruit on it, you get extra points but beware of the monsters.</desc>
	<path>./Q-bert (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>
	<path>./Q-bert's Qubes (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Q*Bert's Qubes is the sequel to the game Q*Bert and features similar gameplay, but is now in three dimensions. Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.</desc>
	<path>./Quadrun (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Quadrun is an arcade style action game for one player. The planet of Quad has been invaded, and all of the "Runts" are imprisoned; your goal is to rescue them! The screen is broken up into four sectors (one on each edge of the screen), with the prison in the center. Your character is equipped with three phaser balls; on the screen you will see the captors running up and down vertically, and you need to hit them with a phaser ball. When hit, the captor will be destroyed and one of the Runts will be able to escape. The Runts will run back and forth horizontally, and you need to catch them before they run into the deadly wall at the edge of the screen. To make the game more challenging, you are only equipped with three phaser balls! This means after firing a phaser ball, you will need to quickly run around to the other side of the screen and catch it before it disappears. You will also lose a phaser ball if one of the captors collides with your character. Lose all three phaser balls, and the game is over. Also, there is a critter counter at the top of the screen; if you fail to destroy one of the captors or if one of the escaped Runts runs into a wall, the critter counter will decrease. If the critter counter runs out, the game ends.</desc>
	<path>./Quest for Quintana Roo (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are Yucatan Sam on a quest to explore the temple of Quintana Roo. Your goal is to find the vault which is hidden somewhere within and return with the treasure that is inside. You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!</desc>
	<path>./Quick Step! (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Quick Step a kangaroo and squirrel are competing against each other to earn points by jumping on trampolines. The screen is made up of an array of trampolines which scroll downward. As trampolines appear at the top of the screen, they will be grey in color; as soon as it turns pink, the trampoline is now in play. Each time a critter jumps on a trampoline, the color will change to that critters color (green for the kangaroo, or blue for the squirrel). If you jump on a pink trampoline, 3 points are earned; when a trampoline falls off the bottom of the screen that is your color, 6 points are earned (so although no points are earned by jumping on your opponents color, you want to try to get as many trampolines as possible your color in order to earn points when they reach the bottom).  If you fall off of the bottom of the screen, a life is lost; the game ends when one player has no more lives left and whomever has more points wins. A few bonuses can also be found; if you see a white trampoline, that is a magic hat; collect it and then jump onto the same space as your opponent to temporarily stun him. Each player also begins the game with 6 tricky traps; pressing the button lays a trap causing the trampoline to disappear so no one can land there.   Each level in the game gets progressively faster; at the end of a level, there will be a single column of fast moving trampolines to jump up, so be careful!</desc>

	<desc>You are a rabbit who is just trying to get to where you can get a mate and make like a mathematician by multiplying. First you must get through the meadow and across the ledges without losing life and limb.

You start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game start back at the beginning only harder.</desc>

	<desc>Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!</desc>
	<path>./Rainbow Invaders (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>It's the year 3006, and the evil Rainbow Invaders from the planet Pacco, are headed to Earth! They look like the ridiculous aliens depicted in 1980s arcade games, but are extremely dangerous and their goal is to exterminate all humans! You command a fleet of spaceships and you must defeat all of the Invaders to save Earth! Good luck!

This game is inspired by the game Space Invaders but with a twist. Yes, there are rows of invaders moving across the screen then moving down, firing as they go. Yes, your ship moves left and right at the bottom of the screen, firing up. Yes, an enemy ship will travel across the top of the screen. But there, the similarities end. For one thing, there are no shields to hide behind. Your ship does have a shield you activate by pulling back on the joystick but be warned, it drains all your energy so when you use it, after it is gone, you cannot move or fire for a second.

Also, the aliens are not dropping just electric shots. They also drop any of sixteen Special Shots. Some of these will help you, most will hinder you.

The Special Shots do the following:

1. Your ship's movements and shots become faster. Duration: ten seconds
2. Your ship's left/right movements are inverted. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
3. Your ship's movements and shots become slower. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
4. Enemies do not fire. Duration: ten seconds
5. Inavders' electric shots descend at maximum speed. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
6. Invaders' electric shots track your ship. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
7. Invaders stop moving. Duration: five seconds
8. Invaders move very fast. Duration: one second
9. All shots, your and the invaders, become invisible. Duration: ten seconds
10. If you shoot at an invader or the enemy ship and miss, a randomly generated invader could appear. And your Shoot Abort option, wherein when you shoot again the last shot disappears, is temporary disabled. Duration: thirty seconds
11. Your ship freezes. Duration: one second
12. Invaders electric shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
13. Your shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
14. Your shots dont stop when they hit an enemy but continue straight to the top of the screen, killing any enemies it hits. Duration: five seconds
15. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you dont blast it immediately, every few moments a new invader is randomly generated. Duration: thirty seconds
16. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you dont blast it before the bonus expires, your ship will explode. Duration: ten seconds. Meaning you have ten seconds to shoot that invader or lose a life</desc>

You, the Ramroid, are on a track in the center of the screen. You can aim left and right to fire. On both sides are colored bars that begin to randomly advance towards the center. You must shoot these bars to drive them back, preferably off the screen. If a bar starts flashing, it is a bonus bar and shooting it gets you larger points as well as clearing it from the screen completely. Be warned, though, that sometimes the bar will reappear on the opposite side of the screen.

A round ends when:
1. You have cleared all the colored bars from the screen or
2. The timer at the bottom, which starts at five thousand, reaches zero or
3. The colored bars have blocked off part of the screen and you clear the rods where you can

After three rounds, the game is over.</desc>

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human</desc>

	<desc>You are presented with a screen full of squares, thirty-two squares wide by twenty squares high. The object of the game is to find a particular set of squares that measure six by six squares. This sounds simple but you are timed. You can view the pattern you need by pressing fire but don't stay long as this makes the timer speed up to twice as fast while you are in that screen. In a two player game, the first player to find the correct pattern collects one point. The game ends when the timer runs out or, in two player, one player reaches nine points.

You start with ninety seconds. If you select the easy difficulty, the second puzzle with have five less seconds. Time decreases per screen until you reach twenty seconds, the lowest time. On the hard setting, you have to clear as many boards as you can in ninety seconds, total.</desc>
	<path>./Reactor (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</desc>

Space pirates are in the area and the robot interceptors are working against us. Your orders are to fly your F-117 Starwarrior to Terra I, destroying anything that tries to harm you.

You can move your ship up, down, left or right. You begin with a top-down view if the F-117, facing towards the bottom of the screen. Meteors and later space pirates come from the bottom moving up and you must shoot them. After you get through these, you switch to a side view of the ship and face left or right. Robot interceptors will come from the sides and must be destroyed then fish force fields (yes, fish force fields) will come from the top, moving down and you must shoot the fish-shaped devices to destroy them. They are Terra I's last defensive line so when you get through them, you win.

In the two player games, player one controls the F-117's left and right movement and player two controls the up and down movement therefore players must work together. Firing alternates between both players in two second intervals.</desc>

Through all this, you must shoot or avoid chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas. Chimpanzees are harmless but orangutans can capture you and place you in a cage in the village and gorillas can capture you and/or shoot you. If you are captured, you must press your button to escape then head south to the desert. After the desert, you enter the poison caves. There are no apes here but you will lose a life point every second you are within. These caves are a maze you must get through but be advised that not all exits lead to the human stronghold. Some exits come out in the forest or desert. Once you reach the human stronghold, you will get a splash screen then your total points then you restart in the forest at a harder level.</desc>

In River Raid II, the gameplay is similar to the original River Raid, but with a few additions. For each mission you start out on an aircraft carrier. After a successful takeoff, you need to get past enemy forces located over the ocean which guard the entrance to the river. Make sure to collect plenty of fuel from the refueling jets, since once you reach the river fuel will become scarce! Next you will have to make your way up the treacherous river channel until you finally reach, and hopefully destroy, the bridge. But the level isn't over yet, for now  you have to return to the aircraft carrier and land safely. After completing all of this, you move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to the expanded levels, another change in River Raid II is the ability to control the altitude of your plane. You can fly high above everything, or fly low into the channel to take out enemy tanks and barges.</desc>

Gameplay takes place on several different screens which have different objectives. First you will need to make your way through Sherwood Forest; numerous henchman are hiding here, so use your arrows to shoot them. Surviving the forest, the next section takes place outside of the castle; naturally, numerous henchman guard the castle gate. While dodging incoming arrows, you need to shoot enough of the henchman to cause the gate to open. Once it opens, you can enter the castle for the final scene. Inside the castle you will be able to find Maid Marian behind one of the many doors, and gold behind another. The rest of the doors have henchman hiding behind them, but if you can find the Maid Marian or the gold then you win this round and the game repeats at a tougher skill level.</desc>
	<path>./Robot Tank (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</desc>
	<path>./Roc 'n Rope (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides. Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points. 

Your player also cannot take a fall, except for extremely small ones unless he is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to "shake" the rope until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope. Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the player.

There are 4 distinct levels; the cliff-side, the windmill, the waterfall and the peak. Completing all of these levels will restart the game with faster enemies and power-ups located in different places.</desc>

You race along a five-lane freeway, in control of a car equipped with weapons, on a mission to destroy certain carrier cars which are causing traffic jams.  You must weave in and out of traffic at high speeds blasting slow-moving cars in your path to reach your destination.  Along the way, you must also avoid obstacles such as destroyed cars, barricades, nails, and  oil slicks on the road.  A radar tracks the enemy and warns of coming danger.

Collisions with other vehicles and objects will damage your car and cause malfunction. The car will repair itself slowly as time lapses, or you may pull over for a quick repair, but you may let your target escape if you take too long. You only have one car, and the game is over when this car is lost.</desc>

Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur.

On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly.

In Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt. Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you must destroy the warhead one-on-one.

In the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course, the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix that will try to hold you off. If you take to log to destroy the warhead, it will escape into space. Whether you destroy it or not, you will then return to the Rocket Construction Site at a harder level.</desc>

	<path>./Save the Whales (USA) (Proto).bin</path>
	<desc>Some whales are traveling from the Arctic Ocean to Baja to breed. The bad news is a whaling ship in the area is attacking them. You must use your submarine to shoot the nets or harpoons and radioactive debris to save the whales.

After you start the game, the whales will move from left to right along the bottom of the screen. The ship will start throwing down nets or harpoons, depending on the settings, to kill the whales. You must aim at the nets, in any direction and shoot them. After several nets/harpoons have been sent, radioactive debris will flow from the right side on the screen. This is up too high to hurt the whales but it can hurt you. You must shoot it as well. If your sub gets hit five times, the game is over. In a two-player game, one player is the sub and the other is the whaling ship.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you are a hard drive read head and must gather the bits in their correct color-coded order. There are ten tracks and bits of various colors will race along from left to right. You must move to the track with the correct color bit and press the button when it is at you to clear it then it is on to the next track. If the needed bit gets past you off the right side of the screen, it will enter the buffer on the bottom left of the screen. If the buffer overflows, the hard drive will crash and game over. You score is displayed in hexadecimal. The first two numbers are the level followed by your score.</desc>
	<path>./Sea Battle (USA) (Proto).bin</path>
	<desc>Sea Battle is a strategic game for two players only. Each player controls a fleet of ships including Submarines, Destroyers, and Battleships. The goal is to engage and sink enemy ships. The winner is the player who commands the troop transport ship into the opponent's harbor. There are two phases in Sea Battle; the strategy phase, and the combat phase. The strategy phase includes maneuvering your fleet into different strategic positions on the map, laying mines, and repair fleets. Opponents engage in ship-to-ship warfare in the combat phase, triggered by the ENGAGE button. Each of the different types of ships has there own strengths and weaknesses, such as weapon range and maneuverability.</desc>
	<path>./Sea Monster (Europe).bin</path>
	<desc>In Sea Monster you control a ship out in the open seas. Beneath the waves are numerous sea monsters, many of which are attacking your ship! Your ship is located at the top of the screen, and your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various sea monsters that swim by. The deeper in the ocean the monster is, the more points it is worth. The game ends when all of your ships have been destroyed. Gameplay is for one or two players, and several game variations are available which control the speed and difficulty.</desc>
	<path>./Seahawk (Europe).bin</path>
	<desc>A fast-paced shooting game that has you in control of a fighter jet named the Sea Hawk, blasting away at enemy helicopters and ships. Two weapons are at your command: Missiles and bombs. If an enemy missile hits your plane, your pilot will eject and use his parachute. Guide him to a friendly ship and a life won't be lost. There are no levels to complete or bosses to beat, and gameplay can continue for as long as you can last.</desc>
	<path>./Seaquest (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Your divers are out in the ocean collecting treasure; now that they have found what they're looking for, you need to pilot a submarine and return them safely to the surface! You can carry up to six divers at a time, and when you safely return the six divers to the surface, you move on to the next, faster level. Your sub has a limited supply of oxygen; if your oxygen meter gets too low, you will need to surface to replenish the oxygen supply. If you surface with less than six divers, you lose one of the divers. If you surface with no divers at all, then your sub will explode. To make your task more challenging, numerous giant sharks and enemy submarines travel throughout the waters and can destroy your sub on contact. To help out with these enemies, you have an unlimited supply of torpedoes which can be fired to destroy both the sharks and subs. As the levels progress, the game gets faster and more enemies appear at a time.</desc>
	<path>./Seawolf (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>This game is inspired by the Brøderbund game Seafox and the Midway coin-op games Sea Wolf and Sea Wolf II, although it is not a direct conversion of any of them.

You are a submarine along the bottom of the sea. You must sink ships with your torpedoes.

You move your sub left or right with the joystick and launch a torpedo with the button. Try to shoot past the mines as they waste torpedoes and give no points. Try to hit ships, destroyers, enemy subs and PT boats. Try to avoid hitting the white ships as these will cause your torpedoes to rebound back down. You have fifty torpedoes and ninety-nine fuel. You lose a life when you run out of fuel. After three lives, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Secret Agent (USA) (Proto).bin</path>
	<desc>They've given you a number and taken away your name - "Secret Agent Man" by Johnny Rivers

You, the Secret Agent, must catch the falling agent items, like U.S. documents, money cases and money bags, while avoiding the undesirables, like bugs, grenades and guns. After a time, a tone will sound. This is when the boats on the water below you will stop moving and you need to get above them and 'make the hand off'. Be careful, though, for although the boats stopped moving, the falling items have not. In two-player games, the players alternate.</desc>
	<path>./Secret Quest (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.

You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring.

Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.

Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen. Hence, the game won't go long if you run out of energy.

Weapon energy use and damage
Energy sword=1 energy and 2 strength
Sonic blaster=2 energy and 4 strength
Particle beam=4 energy and 8 strength.

Scoring
Bear trap=50 points
Potato Man=100 points
Chopper=150 points
Machine=200 points

	<path>./Sentinel (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Sentinel is a side scrolling action game. Several worlds have fallen victim of an alien attack, and you need to free them. To do this, a glowing orb called the Sentinel has been sent which can absorb the alien energy. As the Sentinel floats above the various, scrolling landscapes, you need to protect it from attacks by using the light gun to destroy enemies and enemy fire. If you don't destroy an enemy, it will deplete the Sentinels energy supply which will eventually destroy it. There are four levels of increasing difficulty, each with a large boss at the end. To help out on your mission, several bonuses may be encountered from time to time; increased firepower and energy can be acquired when you shoot the bonus capsules that appear. Three levels of difficulty are available.</desc>
	<path>./Shootin' Gallery (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Shootin' Gallery is a target shooting game similar to Sega's Carnival. You control a gun at the bottom of the screen while various types of targets move left and right above. Given a limited amount of ammo, you need to earn as many points as possible by shooting the targets (which include trains, snails, frogs, kangaroos, monkeys, and more). Naturally more points are awarded for targets that are further away or tougher to hit. At the top of the screen is a cuckoo clock which counts down; when time runs out, a cuckoo will eat some of your remaining ammo! To avoid this, the clock can be shot which resets the timer. Every 20,000 points bonus ammo is awarded. When all of your ammo is gone, the game is over and the score calculated.</desc>

	<path>./Shuttle Orbiter (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You must get ten parts from an orbiting factory to an incomplete space station. Unfortunately, a comet passed near Earth and left a space debris field that you will need to avoid.

After the launch, you will see the Earth being circled but four colored dots. At the bottom will be the elapsed time, remaining fuel and four indicator bars. These bars are your orbit altitudes and their colors correspond to the colors of the orbiting dots: white for the shuttle, gold for the station, red for the orbiting factory, and green for the fuel depot.

When you are lower in orbit than an item, you move faster. If you are higher than an item, you move slower. You must match orbit and location with something to dock. Once you are close to something, you switch to the maneuvering display. Now you can interact with an item or avoid it, as in the debris. If you hit something, whether debris or man-made orbiting item, you begin to leak fuel. This means you will use fuel even if you are not firing thrusters. You also have a 25% chance to damage the part in the cargo hold.

Game variations
The difficulty switches and select switch are not used. After you press fire on the joystick, move the stick up or down to select the difficulty level, from 0 to 3. Game 0 has no space debris.

There is no score, just the amount of time it takes you and whether or not you got all ten parts in place without running out of fuel.</desc>
	<path>./Sinistar (USA) (Proto).bin</path>
	<desc>An unreleased prototype of the classic arcade title.

The player pilots a lone spacecraft, and must create "Sinibombs" by shooting at drifting planetoids and catching the crystals that are thereby released. Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. At the same time, enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Meanwhile, enemy warrior ships can also directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.</desc>
	<path>./Sir Lancelot (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>A damsel in distress is being held in a castle by a fire breathing dragon! As Sir Lancelot, you need to ride your winged horse Pegasus to the rescue. Each level in this action game consists of two screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.</desc>
	<path>./Skate Boardin' (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In this game, you have five minutes to get from your front steps to the steps of the school. You have to get through this maze and conquer 30 tubes and ramps AND get to the school.

You start at your front steps. To get on the board, move left or right and while moving, press fire. When you are on your board, just push the direction you want to turn. Press fire to jump and press and hold fire to jump and land in a crouched position. You will also see rails, walls and hurdles but these you must avoid as they will make you crash.

To jump a ramp, just ride towards it and be aligned with it. To clear a tube, ride through it while crouched. If you ride through grass, it will slow you down. To get back up to speed, either crash into something or ride through grass until you stop then get the skateboard going again.

The scoreboard at the top of the screen is not an obstacle. When you get to it, you just keep going.</desc>
	<path>./Skeet Shoot (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Skeet Shoot, your goal is to earn as many points as you can by shooting clay pigeons. When you press the joystick button, your player will appear on the screen in one of several locations, and a clay pigeon will fire from the center. You need to shoot the clay pigeon before it disappears off the screen to earn a point. The game can be played by one or two players, and numerous game variations are included which control the level of difficulty, speed, and whether a player appears in a fixed or random location on the screen.</desc>
	<path>./Skeleton (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>You hear faint footsteps, so you follow the sound through the 
maze. To your horror, you discover the source of the footsteps 
is a Skeleton; and it doesn't look friendly. Acting quickly, 
you blast it with your Undead Disintegrator and the Skeleton 
vanishes in a flash of colour. But as you reload your UD, you 
hear footsteps again; and you wonder; are you the hunter or the 
hunted in this nightmare?

This game was inspired by the TRS-80 CoCo game The Phantom Slayer. In this title, you move through a maze, searching for skeletons. Find them before they find you. Once you encounter a skeleton, press a button to disintegrate it. There are ten skeletons per maze and eight mazes in total.</desc>

There are two different modes of gameplay. In slalom mode, there are a series of gates you need to ski through; missing any will result in a penalty to your time. In downhill mode you just need to ski to the bottom as fast as possible. Each mode includes five different skill levels which affect the length of the course (and the number of gates in slalom mode.)</desc>

	<desc>Sky Diver is an action game for two players. The goal is to score the most points by jumping from a plane, opening your parachute,  and guiding your sky diver safely to a landing pad. The longer you wait to open your parachute, the more points you earn for a successful landing, but don't wait too long or your chute won't open at all! For each jump, there will be varying wind conditions which blow your sky diver off course. A wind sock at the bottom of the screen will help you determine the wind speed and direction so you can compensate. There are nine jumps total, and the player with the most points at the end wins.</desc>
	<path>./Sky Jinks (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Fly slalom around pylons (right of the red ones, left of the blue ones). Avoid skipping a pylon, hitting the pylons, trees or hot-air balloons. Try to get the best time you can. If you fly to the wrong side of a pylon, you will get a three second penalty for each missed pylon. The total number of pylons remaining is at the top of the screen above the time. If you hit a tree, pylon or balloon your plane will crash to the ground. You will not die but this will hurt your time as your plane has to take off again. Hitting a pylon will not hurt your pylon count. You will still get credit for the pylon but will lose time as your plane was slowed. You can press the fire button to throttle up or release to throttle down. Move the joystick left or right to turn. You bank into turns so you need to time turns as it is not instant. Up and down on the joystick do nothing.</desc>
	<path>./Sky Skipper (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You pilot a plane and must rescue animals from cages where they were placed by gorillas. To do this, you fly over a gorilla and drop a bomb, knocking the gorilla off its feet. Once this is done, the animals will be out of their cages and you just touch each one to rescue it. The animal cages will only be open for a limited time, then the gorilla will get back on its feet. You must then knock it down again.

You mustn't take too long rescuing the animals or you will run out of fuel. If you run out of fuel, run into a gorilla or the course walls or, strangely, a cloud, you lose a plane. You begin the game with four planes.

Difficulty switches
Set to A for faster plane, set to B for slower plane.

Game variations
Game 1...Tricky flying course
Game 2...Tricky flying course and clouds
Game 3...Tricky flying course, clouds and faster plane.

Scoring
Knock a gorilla of its feet=10 points
Rescue any one animal=100 points
Rescue one of each of the four types of animals, consecutively (1 cat, 1 turtle, 1 rabbit, 1 duck)=500 points

You get an extra plane every 10,000 points.</desc>

	<path>./Smurfs Save the Day (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In this children's learning game, you learn music, sorting and color mixing.

With Harmony Smurf, the computer will play four, five or six notes and you must repeat them. After the notes play, they fall to the ground and you must put them in their correct spots. The highest level has invisible notes, you must match by sound only.

There are two modes, changed by the select switch.
In Game Mode, the computer plays and you must duplicate it. In Toy Mode, there are six notes on the ground and you can make any tune you like, the computer doesn't create a tune.

With Handy Smurf, items will move along a conveyor belt and you must sort them into one of three bins. You press the button to close or open gaps to guide the object but don't press too soon or the gap returns to the way it was before after a short time.

In Game Mode, the first five items are sorted by shape, the next five by size and the next five by color then the sequence repeats only faster. In Toy Mode, after each item is sorted, the sorting criteria (shape, size or color) changes randomly.

With Greedy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf has a colored liquid in a glass. Using blue, red, yellow and white spigots, Greedy must put the same color liquid or mix liquids to get the same color in his glass. If he gets it right, he and Clumsy drink up. If he gets it wrong, the glass drains out.

In Game Mode, the colors start easy and get progressively harder. In Toy Mode, the color selection in Clumsy's glass is random.

There is no time limit or penalty if you get something wrong.</desc>

When all of the cells in a matrix have been collected, you move on to the next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer; if you collect all solar cells before this timer runs out, you will earn bonus points and skip ahead a level.

Gameplay is the same - shoot the rows of invaders and avoid their bullets, using your bases as shields and taking out the enemy mothership when it appears.</desc>
	<path>./Space Invaders (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>
	<path>./Space Jockey (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Space Jockey is a side scrolling shooter for one player. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by having your attack saucer shoot down the varied enemies which fly by. Tanks, jet planes, prop planes, helicopters, weather balloons, and even some trees and houses will all pass by on the screen and try to destroy your saucer. You need to make sure you avoid colliding with the various enemies and their fire or one of your three saucers will be lost. Extra saucers are awarded for each 1000 points earned. Several game variations are included which control the game difficulty, the movement abilities of the enemies, and the movement abilities of your saucer.</desc>
	<path>./Space Shuttle - A Journey Into Space (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>

	<desc>Your planet has done well but your neighbors have not so they have attacked and stolen your food. It is in a space cage. You must make your way past them to return the food to your planet.

You start at the bottom of the screen, on your base. You must push up to launch from your base, at which point you will begin consuming fuel. You must then make your way through drones that are moving left or right to the space cage at the top of the screen. When you are at the opening of the cage, where the food is, push up to retrieve it. Once you have the food, you must make your way back through the drones to your base before you run out of fuel. If you die, for whatever reason, before you return to your base with the food, you must restart the level at the bottom.

If your fuel gets too low (the indicator will turn red) your ship will actually slow down. Starting with level three, you must first grab a passkey from among the drones to open the cage and then go get the food and return.</desc>

	<path>./Spacechase (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are on a moon-based scouting mission in a Mark 16 Starcruiser. Suddenly, enemy alien ships teleport in and start firing neutron missiles, which can destroy you upon impact. You must destroy enemy ships until reinforcements arrive from Earth. The enemy also have laser-directed heat-seeking proton missiles which are fired sparingly. Be aware that as the battle progresses, the aliens will become more desperate and will use the laser-directed heat-seeking proton missiles more often.

You can move in any of the eight directions in the bottom third of the screen. Press the button to fire.

	<path>./SpaceMaster X-7 (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are an assault ship that was designed to destroy Hyperion military bases.

You must shoot the bases enough so that the energy meter at the bottom goes from the "+" to the "-". Once the meter gets to "-" the base will explode.

Obviously, the base is not a sitting duck. There is a force field that expands and contracts, base defenders and , in higher rounds, shields. The force field has a gap in it that you can shoot through or you can maneuver inside the field and shoot the base up close. Be careful, though, because you can get caught within the field.

If you touch a shield, the force field, the base or are touched by a defender, you lose a life.

The defenders are fireballs, heat seekers, bouncers, wanderers, and homers.

The scoring is as follows:
Destroy a fireball = 25 Points
Destroy a heat seeker = 100 Points
Destroy a bouncer = 50 Points
Destroy a wanderer = 200 Points
Destroy a homer = 400 Points

You also get 25 points for each hit you get on the base.

When you destroy the first four bases, you get 1,000 points per base; the next four, 2,000 points per base and so on.

You get a bonus ship after every second base you destroy and after every 10,000 points.</desc>

	<desc>Spider Fighter is an arcade style action game somewhat similar to Space Invaders. You control a bug blaster at the bottom of the screen, and need to defend the three pieces of fruit at the top right of the screen. Various types of attacking spiders scurry around rapidly, trying to destroy your blaster and steal the fruit. If all of your fruit is stolen or you lose all of your bug blasters, the game is over. When all the spiders on a round are destroyed, you move on to the next, faster round. If you still have all three pieces of fruit when a round is completed, you receive an extra bug blaster.</desc>
	<path>./Spider-Man (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>The Green Goblin has set a super bomb at the top of a high voltage tower located on the top of a skyscaper! As Spider-Man, you need to scale the building and defuse the bomb. Use your web to climb the building, but be careful of Green Goblin's villians which appear in the windows trying to stop you. If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points. When you reach the top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.</desc>
	<path>./Spike's Peak (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Spike's Peak is an action game where you need to climb to the top of a mountain! Gameplay takes place on five different screens. The first screen shows you approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four different difficulty levels available.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you are an American fighter pilot. Your mission is to shoot down enemy planes, shoot enemy ammo dumps (they look like little black houses) and enemy anti-aircraft guns (they kinda look like sundials). If you fly down too long, you will get a low altitude warning. If you don't correct, you will crash. You can also be shot down by anti-aircraft guns and enemy planes. Push left and right to go those directions but push up to go down and down to go up. Push the fire button to fire machine guns.</desc>
	<path>./Springer (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are Springer the rabbit. You must jump from cloud to cloud, collecting everything you can, to reach the sun.

You must jump from cloud to cloud and touch any items or eggs to collect them. If an egg hatches into a dragon, you can kick the dragon to collect him. There is a bonus timer that counts down on the screen so don't delay. Once you reach the sun at the top, then it is off to a more challenging screen.</desc>
	<path>./Sprint Master (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Sprintmaster is an action racing game similar to Super Sprint. The game is played with an overhead view of the racetrack, and the first of two players to race around the track for the required number of laps wins! Occasionally a bonus will appear in the roadway; collect these to increase the traction capabilities of your car or gain a temporary speed boost. Other obstacles, such as oil slicks, may also appear in the roadway which will cause you to lose control and speed. There is a total of nine different tracks with varying levels of difficulty to race on, and you can choose either blacktop, dirt, or ice for terrain.</desc>
	<path>./Spy Hunter (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>
	<path>./Squeeze Box (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Squeeze Box your goal is to escape from prison! To escape, you will need to blast your way through the wall on either the left or right side of the screen. Once a hole large enough to walk through is formed, you can use it to escape to the next screen. To make the game more difficult, the walls are constantly growing, and if you touch a wall you will lose a life! A second game variation is included where one wall is stationary, and the second wall grows. Your goal is to shoot all of the moving multi-colored wall blocks to turn them white. A row of blocks turns white when they all of have been destroyed; the row will then begin growing again, but you will now longer be able to shoot the blocks! When all of the rows have been changed to white, you will move on to the next level. The third (and final) game variation included is similar to the second one, except that the wall behind you will also move inwards; Your goal is still to shoot your way through the left wall before the right wall catches up to you. Each variation has two difficulty levels, the tougher difficulty has twice as many blocks as the easier.</desc>

	<desc>Climb up the side of a series of 48-story buildings to collect suitcases full of money, while avoiding creepy monsters and falling objects that try to knock you off. Fortunately, you can strike back against the monsters by smashing them flat, by smashing them on the head. Don't linger too long, though, since they are soon resurrected, white and unsquishable. 

Squish 'Em is similar to Crazy Climber, with much faster gameplay.</desc>
	<path>./Sssnake (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You were hunting in the Amazon when you become the hunted of prehistoric creatures. You found a fortress with a large gun. Now you must avoid the snakes that enter and exit and shoot the creatures through the holes in the fortress bricks.

The snakes will slither from one side on the screen to the other then come the opposite way one level lower. You cannot kill the snake but you can shorten it when you shoot it. Your gun runs on a gun track inside the fortress walls and always shoots away from the fortress. You cannot shoot through the bricks themselves, only in between them.

Game variations
In game one, the snakes enter the screen from one side but move fast. In game two, they enter from any side but move slower. Either way, you only have one life. Player two begins after player one by just pressing the button on the right joystick. If there is no player two or after player two dies, then you must press reset to play again.

Scoring
You score one point for shooting a prehistoric creature.
You gain no points for shooting at the bricks or shooting the snake.</desc>
	<path>./Stampede (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>It's a stampede!! Your job is to round up as many of the calves as you can. The screen scrolls to the right as you chase the calves; if more than three calves get past you, the game is over. The calves all run at different speeds, and when you rope one you earn points based on how fast it was running. As the game progresses, more and more calves will be on the screen at one time, and other obstacles will begin appearing to trip your horse and slow you down.</desc>
	<path>./Star Fire (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>This is a conversion of a 1980 Exidy coin-op game.

It is a time of crisis for the Earth forces. Years of constant assault
from the EXIDY coalition have left Earth almost totally defenseless.

Intergalactic intelligence has discovered a new threat, several Exidy
freighters, protected by an armada of smaller vessels, have entered a
friendly sector of space and are advancing on Earth itself, loaded with
enough weaponry to completely annihilate the planet.

You are Earth's only hope.

Aim your cross hair onto an enemy ship and press the button to fire. Try to shoot as many enemies as you can. Once you destroy all the enemies in a sector, a warp gate appears. Shoot it to warp to the next sector. Whenever your ship gets a direct hit from enemy fire, your shield loses energy. To restore shield energy look out for, and shoot, energy diamonds.</desc>
	<path>./Star Fox (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Star Fox is a horizontally scrolling action game. You control a starship on a foreign planet with the mission of collecting valuable crystals. The crystals will be located on the planets surface or somewhere in the atmosphere. When you locate a crystal, you need to fly down into the planets atmosphere to retrieve it (be careful, your ship has limited maneuverability while in the atmosphere). Of course, your mission won't be easy; guarding the planet are numerous enemy fighters. To protect yourself from enemy attacks your ship is equipped with lasers. The game ends when all of your ships have been destroyed. Good luck!</desc>
	<path>./Star Raiders (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all of the Krylon fighters which are closing in on your starbases! There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starships energy; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shield, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the Krylon that are visible on your galactic map have been destroyed, you win this round and can advance in rank (or even be demoted if you performed poorly on a mission).  The games difficulty will gradually increase as you rise in rank from ships cook up to captain.</desc>
	<path>./Star Ship (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Star Ship contains three different arcade action games which can be played by one or two players.

Star Ship
These game variations are played from a first person point of view in your star ship. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various enemies and space debris. You have a time limit of 2 minutes 16 seconds in the one player versions. In the two player version the time limit is 4 minutes 32 seconds; for half of this time one player will be the star ship commander, and the other will control a space module and needs to dodge the star ships fire. The roles will be reversed for the second half of the time limit.

Warp Drive
These game variations are also played from a first person point of view. Your goal here is to travel as much distance as possible while avoiding the oncoming asteroids.

Lunar Lander
These game variations are played from a third person point of view. You need to pilot your star ship and successfully land on the constantly moving moon. One point is earned for each successful landing, and asteroids and other debris may get in your way and will deduct points if you crash. In the two player versions, one player controls the star ship and the other player controls the moon.

Each of these games feature several variations which control the game speed and level of difficulty.</desc>
	<path>./Star Strike (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Star Strike was clearly inspired by the Death Star battle sequence in the movie Star Wars. You fly a space craft into the enemy launch trench. Your mission: to destroy the alien station before Earth passes directly over the launch trench. You must evade the alien ships that are defending the launch trench while being sure to bomb the red "Hot Targets". The very first red target that is missed when the Earth is directly in the middle of the launch trench becomes a missile. The missile is launched and destroys Earth.</desc>
	<path>./Star Trek - Strategic Operations Simulator (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view</desc>
	<path>./Star Voyager (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Star Voyager is an action game similar to Star Raiders. You control the space ship Star Voyager from a first person perspective; your objective is to make your way through seven star portals to save the Capital Starport, destroying enemy ships along the way. On each level there will be multiple enemies to destroy; typically they appear first in the distance, then close in slowly while firing torpedoes at you. Using the Star Voyagers weapons (either lasers or photon torpedoes) you need to destroy the enemies before they destroy you. Once a star portal appears, you need to navigate your way through to reach the next level (don't crash into the portal walls, you'll be destroyed!). In addition to the main viewport, the bottom of the screen also contains a status bar which shows the number of enemies destroyed, your energy level, and a scanner to help locate enemies.

Two player game variations are also included; in these one player controls Star Voyager, and the other player can choose to either control Star Voyagers weapons or the enemy ships.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - Jedi Arena (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Jedi Arena, you have to face an opponent in the arena to see who is the true Jedi master. Wandering throughout the arena is a seeker which is capable of firing laser bolts. To be victorious you need to destroy your opponents shield by having the seeker fire laser bolts at it. You are armed only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well as block incoming fire from your opponent. The first player to break through the other players shield wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match! Several game options are included which control the speed of the seeker, or even make the seeker invisible.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - Return of the Jedi - Death Star Battle (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>"Death Star Battle" is loosely based on the events of "Star Wars, Part 6: Return of the Jedi". Your task is to destroy the Death Star before its construction is finished. You start the task outside the shield perimeter of the Death Star. There you'll have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the energy shield. After reaching the Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the point where you can hit the core. In the following blow up of the station you must avoid collision with Death Star debris.

After successful destruction the game will restart with increased difficulty (faster enemies, faster Death Star build up, etc).

Overall difficulty can also be adjusted before starting the game.</desc>

Lock your sights on attacking TIE FIGHTERS and blast them with your proton torpedoes. Race along the DEATH STAR's surface, firing on giant towers. Finally, dive full throttle into the DEATH STAR's equatorial trench. You'll need split-second timing to avoid all the obstacles as you streak through the trench in search of the main reactor. Hit it and you've blown the DEATH STAR out of existence! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back recreates a scene from the movie of the same name. You are on the icy planet of Hoth, and Imperial Walkers are closing in on the rebel power generator. As the pilot of a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!</desc>
	<path>./Stargate (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Save the humanoids from the impending aliens in the sequel to Defender. The task is still rescuing humanoids before Landers can turn them into Mutants, while avoiding and shooting other foes, however you must now carry humanoids to safety through the Stargate of the title. 

Entering this Stargate not only warps you to the nearest humanoid in jeopardy, but can also warp you ahead (while on the first 15 levels) if you enter it with 4 or more humanoids, and give you extra lives if you warp with 10 humanoids, so there is a trade-off between guaranteeing the safety of existing humanoids, and trying to advance your position

There are more enemies on screen than ever before. The Inviso button makes you invisible to enemies, but also to yourself, so you will have to follow your bullets to work out where on the screen you are.</desc>
	<path>./Stargunner (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Players take the role of a stargunner for the Yarthae Empire. The Empire is being invaded by the Sphyzygi. The stargunner must destroy their invading ships but beware of the bombs dropped by the Sphyzygi droid, Bobo.

This game is similar to Defender without the humanoids to rescue. Players must fly around the screen, shooting any incoming ships that appear. Watch out for the satellite-like object, at the top of the screen, as it drops bombs. Play simply continues from wave after wave of ships, until the player loses their last ship.</desc>
	<path>./StarMaster (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases.   In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.</desc>

The horse's names, from bottom to top, are: Lucky Devil, Absent Mind, Just Missed and Little Dictator. You play as one of the jockeys and must reach the right side of the screen first. The horse runs and hurdles come at you from the right. To jump these hurdles, you turn the paddle to set the height of the jump, as indicated by the marker on the right. You press the button to jump. The better you jump, the faster your horse goes. After 3 minutes, if no one has gotten all the way to the right, the race ends and whoever was in the lead wins.

There are 6 game variations. In games 1, 2 and 3, the distance between the hurdles is uniform with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.
In games 4, 5 and 6, the the distance between the hurdles is random with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.

	<path>./Stellar Track (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>This is an Atari 2600 version of a Star Trek game found on many college mainframes.

Like those mainframe programs, it has no graphics, only text. You use the joystick, moving left or right, to select the command you want then press the red button. You then move the joystick left or right to select set the parameters of that command, if there are any. You start by pressing Reset or Select to choose how many enemies you must kill in how many stardates. 

The commands and any settings are as follows:

Galaxy Map=a 6x6 grid that starts out empty until you do a long range scan. Afterwards, the quadrants will show a 2 digit number. The left digit is the number of aliens in the area. The right digit will either be a 1 or a zero, depending on whether there is or is not a starbase in that area. Galaxy map costs you no energy or stardates.

LR Scan=Long range scan. This will tell you what is in your quadrant and all the quadrants next to yours. If there are any enemies in your quadrant when you do an LR scan, they will attack you. LR scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.

SR Scan=Short range scan. This shows you the stars, aliens and starbases in your quadrant. You need to do this to destroy aliens and dock with starbases. Like LR Scan, if there are aliens in your quadrant, they will attack after you use SR Scan. Also, like LR Scan, SR Scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.

Warp=Warp is how you move, either from quadrant to quadrant or from sector to sector within a quadrant. You move by setting 2 settings. The first is your direction. You select a direction based on the numbers below:
8 1 2

/
7--*--3
/ 

6 5 4
Next, you select how many quadrants and sectors to move. If you want to move within a quadrant, set the left number to zero so you don't warp out of that quadrant. Warp uses stardates, energy and a turn. If you warp into a quadrant that has only you and stars, the screen will be green. If you warp into a quadrant with aliens or aliens and a starbase, the screen will be red. If you warp into a quadrant with just the starbase, the screen will be gray. You cannot warp through stars. If you try, you lose the stardate and energy but don't go anywhere.

Photon Torpedo=If you hit an enemy with one of these, just one shot kills them. You select the direction with the same numbers as warp. there must be a clear line of sight between you and the enemy; no stars. You carry up to 9 torpedoes and they can be replenished. Photon torpedoes do not cost energy or time, just a turn.

Phasers=Unlike photon torpedoes, you do not need to be directly in line of the enemy or tell the game where to fire. You just set how strong you want the blast to be, via a three digit number, and the computer fires. The closer you are to the enemy, the harder you hit. Phasers use the amount of energy from you as you fired. You also use a turn.

Status=A status report. This will tell you how many stardates, aliens, energy units and photon torpedoes are left and whether you have taken damage and to what. If you have taken damage, you will see a negative number next to the damaged item. This is how many stardates it will take to repair the item on your own. You cannot leave the quadrant if your engines are damaged. Instead, you must try to warp the number of quadrants that would take that much time. You won't go anywhere but you will repair.

If you dock at a starbase, you are instantly repaired of all damage, refueled and torpedoes are restocked. Starbases are placed randomly in the galaxy and never move or get destroyed. There are always two per galaxy. To dock, warp to the quadrant and sector where the base is, so you over the top of it.

Skill (Difficulty) switches
The right switch controls how easily you take damage. In the Expert (A) position, your chance of taking damage is twice as likely as in the Novice (B) position.
The left switch controls phaser strength. In the Novice (B) position, your phasers are twice as strong as the aliens'. In the Expert (A) position, your phasers are the same strength as the aliens'.</desc>

You are a tank that must get past obstacles and avoid enemy fire to reach a base at the far end on the course. You must not delay, however, as you will run out of fuel. There are fuel depots along the course that can refill you but be warned that sometimes the enemy guns will destroy these before you can grab it.

You start with three tanks. If you run out of fuel, are shot or run into a wall or enemy gun, you lose a tank. In two player game, you alternate tanks each time you die.</desc>
	<path>./Strat-O-Gems Deluxe (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>Strat O Gems Deluxe is a falling jewels game similar to Columns, Acid Drop, Jewel Master, Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest, among others.

Three colored gems fall from the top of the screen in a vertical pattern. You must place the gems on the growing pile so that there are three or more of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When you get three or more of the same color in a row, they will disappear from the screen. If you get a combo of three or more levels, you get a high bonus. A combo is when gems disappear and cause more gems to line up and disappear. Occasionally, three gems that change colors and have colored horizontal bars across them will appear. These will create a row with whatever gems you place them on. At the end of the level, a flashing white gem with a horizontal white bar will drop down. This will remove whatever color gem it is placed on, regardless of where they are on the screen. If the gems pile up to the line at the top of the screen, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Strawberry Shortcake - Musical Match-Ups (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Strawberry Shortcake Musical Match-Ups is a puzzle game where you try to straighten out mixed up Strawberryland characters within a given time limit. When the game begins, a mixed up character will appear on the screen and you need to change the head, body, and legs until they are all from a single character. If a complete character is correctly formed, the character will perform a dance and you will hear their musical theme; if an incomplete character is formed, the musical theme heard will be partially from each of the characters you did create. Several levels of difficulty are included which dictate the time limit and which character needs to be created. In the easier levels, the character you must create will be indicated by text at the bottom of the screen. In the more difficult levels, you must create a character based on the theme song that plays.</desc>
	<path>./Street Racer (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Street Racer is an action racing game for one to four players played from an overhead view. The screen is split into two lanes; in one or two player games, each player has a lane. In three and four player games, players must share the lanes. Each game has a two minute and sixteen second time limit, and your goal is to earn as many points as possible by the end of this time. In addition to the basic racing version, several other game variations are included as well. The games available are:

Street Racer: This is the basic race car game. Points are earned by passing other cars.

Slalom: Each player controls a skier and needs to slalom through the course to earn points.

Dodgem: Each player controls a race car and needs to avoid the oncoming obstacles. One point is earned for successfully completing the race course.

Jet Shooter: Each player controls a jet in this game. Points are earned for shooting down the various oncoming planes.

Number Cruncher: Each player controls a motorcycle in this game variation. Various numbers will appear in the race track, and points are earned by running over the numbers.

Scoop Ball: Each player controls a race car with a scoop on the front. The goal is to scoop up the balls that appear in the raceway and then place them in a computer controlled car.</desc>
	<path>./Stronghold (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are sent to check out an abandoned asteroid base called Stronghold. As you approach, drones are launched from the surface. It may be abandoned but apparently the automatic defense system still works.

You must shoot or avoid the drones. If the drones are cloned, and traveling in sets, shooting any drone in the set destroys all the ones in the set, if they are destroyable (see Game variations). You can move in any direction but cannot shoot straight left or right. You can shoot in any other direction, however. After you get past the drones, three shields form near the bottom of the screen. Also, interceptor and patrol ships appear. The interceptors track you and the patrol ships just move back and forth over the shields.

You must shoot through the shields while dodging these ships so you can shoot the command crawler on the asteroid's surface. Be warned, though, that once there is a hole in the shield, the command crawler will shoot through it to destroy you. The crawler tries to stay below you but it is slow. In some game variations, the Mega-Field starts to form at the top of the screen, reducing your maneuvering room(see Game variations).

With 8 difficulty settings there is a lot of the game to master as you must start to keep an eye on your fuel, torpedoes, radar, and enemy while avoiding depth charges as the difficulty rises.  You can fire up to two torpedoes at a time. While enemy shows go by your periscope sink as many as you can.  The periscope can turn 360 degrees and look off into the horizon or close to your sub.  Some ships move slower than others, and one of the ships moves so fast that the only way to hit it is by tracking it by radar instead of visually.</desc>

	<desc>Subterranea is a side scrolling shooter. Your goal is to locate treasure crystals within the Hexuplex Caves. Controlling your cave ranger, you need to blast the various types of aerobots which are guarding the cave. When all of the bots on a cave level have been destroyed, a passageway opens allowing you to travel deeper into the caverns. When you reach the last level of the cavern, you can collect the treasure crystal and be transported to the next (more challenging) set of caves and try for another crystal. In addition to the deadly aerobots, be sure not to crash into cave walls; these will drain your energy rapidly, especially if you hit one of the skulls. When all of your reserve cave rangers have crashed, the game is over. As you progress through the caves, they become narrower and the enemies move faster. Standard and advanced skill levels are available.</desc>

	<path>./Super Breakout (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Super Breakout features similar gameplay to the original, but with several new game variations. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. To do this, you need to use the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the playfield. There are four different game variations included. The first is 'Breakout', and plays the same as the original game. 

This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there's room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top. 

The other two games add a second paddle. In 'Double Breakout' you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.</desc>

Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

This game is in three sections. They are called Shipwrecked, The Wilderness Island and The Secret Temple.

Shipwrecked: You begin on a raft in the water. You must make your way to the island at the top while avoiding sharks and other sea creatures. Along the way, you must collect food and water so you can survive the island. If a shark or other sea creature hits you, you will lose the raft and all supplies. If you are hit when not on a raft, you will lose your life. You can press fire to swim faster but this will cost you life points, which can get you killed.

The Wilderness Island: You make your way on the island while avoiding snakes, traps and other dangers. You must look for the temple, the key to the temple door and any other items you will need to get through the temple. Watch your food meter that it doesn't run out. Use the menu to eat food/drink water as needed. You can also switch to search mode, which allows you to place your walking stick on an item to learn what it is without getting hurt.

The Secret Temple: You make your way through the temple in first person perspective, trying to learn its secret. Sometimes you will need to find certain items to pass through magical barriers. Watch out for one-way walls and invisible transporters.</desc>

	<desc>You have entered a wizard's dungeons in search of the fabled Sword of Saros. You must avoid the wizard, his hunter bat and other nasties while gathering treasure. Then you must escape from the dungeons.

You begin in the maze. The narrow areas are corridors and the wider areas are rooms. You must move from room to room, avoiding the wizard and his bat, gathering treasure, items and keys. Once in a room, do not stand around as each room has a monster in it that will harm you. Some rooms have doors that have either gold or a part of the sword behind them. When you find the sword piece, it will transport you to the next level of the dungeon.

In the first two levels, you will be able to see the entire maze. On the next two levels, you will reveal parts of the mazes as you explore them. On all later levels, you will only see directly around you. If a monster touches you, you will lose life points. If you encounter the wizard, you will lose life points and will need to get through his skeletons. You will start at the bottom of the screen and need to make your way to the top. In the final dungeon, all the rooms have only unlocked doors but you will need gold to bribe the monsters so you can search the doors for the exit.

The items in the maze, and their uses, are:

1. Gold: Not a selectable item. Needed to bribe monsters in the last level
2. Gems: If you collect nine gems, you can use them to get one or more type of each other item
3. Lamp: Makes it possible to see the entire maze. Not needed for mazes one or two.
4. Potion: Restores four to seven life points. You can never have more than twenty-five total life points.
5. Cross: Makes the wizard and bat move as far from you as the can
6. Scroll: Allows you to see the wizard and bat, even if they are not in a visible portion of the maze. Not needed for mazes one and two.
7. Ring: Makes you invisible to the wizard, bat and room monsters
8. Keys: Not a selectable item. Needed to open locked doors except on last dungeon. Keys do not leave the dungeon level where they are found. When you get the sword piece, any extra keys you are carrying are lost and you must find new keys.</desc>

	<path>./Tapeworm (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You are Slinky the tapeworm. You must move about the bean patch, eating beans. Each time you eat a bean, you grow longer and the bean count goes down by one.

Beans appear randomly in the patch and you must eat them before the beetle at the bottom get from left to right to get the count down to zero. If the beetle gets to the right before you get the bean, two more beans will appear in the patch and two more beans are added to the count.

At times, Beeky the bird or Spanky the spider will pass through the bean patch. In later levels, an obstacle will appear in the middle of the patch.

You lose a life if you touch your head (yellow square) to the obstacle or the sides of the patch, touch your head to your body, or Spanky or Beeky touch your head (eat you).

The third patch is night. When you get a bean, you can see the patch for two seconds. If you need more looks, you can press the fire button for another two seconds of light but it costs you a bean.

The levels and their point values are:
Apple (5 points per bean, 50 points for the apple)
Orange (10 points per bean, 100 points for the orange)
Grape (15 points per bean, 150 points for the grapes)
Strawberry (20 points per bean, 200 points for the strawberry)
Banana (25 points per bean, 250 points for the banana)

You get a bonus worm every 1,000 points. You can have up to 4 worms in reserve.</desc>

In this game, you start out on the income screen where you try to collect the money (dollar signs) while avoiding the governmental red tape (look like red snakes). You have only one year to get your money and invest it. Each second, a day goes by. My, how time flies.

Once a season, you are sent to the investment/tax shelter screen, where you must collect an icon representing an investment and then grab your portfolio (briefcase). Investments have a 50/50 chance of making or losing money. Also on this screen is a character whose color changes.

What color he is determines who he is:
Black=Eggie, the IRS agent. If he catches you, he will audit you. In these audits, you always lose. You are then taxed at 50% of your income and sent back to the income screen.There are no appeals to tax court.
Pink=Waggie, the CPA. If he catches you (or you go to him), he will charge you $1,000.00 but whatever tax sheltered investment you have, he will put you in a better one.
Green=Toodles, the registered investment adviser. If you two meet, he will put you in the best tax sheltered investment available, thus making you the most profit.

After each season, you are taxed to an amount determined by your tax shelter. The object is to have $1,000,000.00 at the end of the year after taxes.</desc>

	<desc>In this game, you are Leatherface. Some tourists have trespassed onto your land. They have been mostly eliminated but a few remain.

The object is to chase down the remaining tourists and kill them.
You chase the tourists with your chainsaw. When you get next to them, you press the fire button to rev up your saw and make cold-cuts out of them.

Try to avoid obstacles like hedges, fences, cow skulls and wheelchairs.
Try not to rev the chainsaw unnecessarily as you only have 3 tanks of fuel and when you're out of fuel, the game is over.

If you run into fences, cow skulls or wheelchairs, you will be delayed a moment. If you run into hedge, you will need to use the chainsaw to remove them. The chainsaw idles all the time so you don't want to be delayed.

You get 1000 points for each tourist killed. You get a new fuel tank every 5000 points. When you run out of fuel, a tourists comes up behind you and kicks you in the pants.</desc>

You must guide your lander around asteroids to land on one of three platforms at the bottom. Be sure to press the button so you fire the retrorockets so you do not come in at too high a speed and destroy the lander. Also, take care not to hit the survivor you are going to try to rescue. Once you have your survivor, some of the asteroids change into flying saucers. You must then fly back up through these obstacles to dock with the mothership's docking area. Do not hit the left or right of it or you lose a life and the survivor you were carrying. Once all survivors are rescued, it is off to level two.</desc>

	<desc>There are six Core nuclear bases on the planet's surface. You must burrow underground to each of these bases and destroy them. But be warned, they are guarded by patrolling Core Ranger tanks that if they get you in their line of fire, will destroy you.

There are two types of tanks. The white Sentry tanks only move through existing tunnels and will only fire on you if there is clear space between you and them. The blue Digger tanks will create their own tunnels to pursue you. There is also a Sentry tank at the bottom of the screen that slowly moves towards your reserve tanks. If this tank reaches you reserves before you destroy all six bases, you lose a life. The game is over if you lose all lives.

There are enemy supplies buried in random areas that if you get them will get you bonus points. Later levels have the bases only appear one at a time or have no dirt between you and the enemy tanks, leaving them to pursue you from the start.</desc>

	<path>./Tomcat - The F-14 Fighter Simulator (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>To be born with wings...

Become a F-14 Naval Aviator undergoing seek and destroy missions while dodging and gunning enemy bogeys in deadly dogfights with your 20mm cannon and air-to-air missiles.

You cockpit comes with state of the art technology, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force: Display and main computer, Bogey Alert Indicator, G-Force Indicator, Electronic Counter Measures, and a Cannon Overheat Indicator (yes, it can overheat!)...and if your feeling up to it, give the ol'bird a boost to Mach 1.0!

The gameplay like other simulation games consists of taking off, flying, combat and landing. Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision.

Taking off and landing however, also required additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise (No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try no to run over him...yet).

Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!).

After each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.</desc>
	<path>./Tooth Protectors (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In this game, you are T. P., the Tooth Protector, and are trying to protect some teeth from tooth decay by the Snack Attacks. 

Snack Attack moves across the top of the screen dropping snack food crumbs towards the teeth. You move at the bottom of the screen, just above the teeth. You must deflect the crumbs back up, hopefully hitting Snack Attack or a falling crumb for points. 

Each round is time-limited. You play until the time runs out then you get bonus points depending on weather you lost any teeth and how many. 

Occasionally, Snack Attack will try to swoop down and grab you. If you are caught, you lose a man. 

If one or more of your teeth are in danger of being lost, indicated by it flashing, you can press your fire button to Reach toothbrush, Johnson &amp; Johnson dental floss and Act fluoride dental rinse to save that/those tooth/teeth. You get three of these cleanings to start but earn bonus cleanings every 50,000 points. 

The game is over after you lose all three of your men or lose three of your teeth.</desc>

Your goal is to rescue as many survivors as possible from the many floors of the building. On each floor, your fire fighter begins at the bottom of the screen and needs to reach the top where the survivors have taken cover. Blocking your path are numerous (and dangerous) fires. Your fire fighter is equipped with a hose and an unlimited water supply to help you put out the fires. You need to be quick, however, for if you take too long the survivors will die! When you rescue as many survivors as you can and make it back out of the room, the floor is complete and a helicopter will transport you to the next floor. Although it isn't necessary to put out all of the fires on a floor, you will earn bonus points if you do. The higher you get in the building, the tougher the game becomes. Gameplay is for one or two players, and several game variations and difficulty levels are available.</desc>

A great reward for having gotten all of Santa's toys painted in record time. Unfortunately for you, Patrick's idea of "painting" toys was dumping them all in a bucket of gray paint. While this technically fulfilled his associates' obligations (thus their trip to the Bahamas), the toys--alas--still have to be painted properly.

It's now your job to clean up their mess, which means properly painting the toys in time for Santa's departure Christmas Eve. You must paint the toys as they move along five conveyor belts. Ahh, but only if it were as easy as it sounds! Toys must be painted the proper color, and some toys require two coats of paint (with different colors), and if that wasn't bad enough, some must have their coats applied in the proper order! And not that you needed the additional pressure, but you also have a daily quota to meet. You must properly paint all the toys that appear on the conveyor belts each day before the whistle at the end of your shift sounds!

Santa's counting on you to ensure that all the toys are painted correctly! Can you get the job done before Santa's sleigh is loaded up on Christmas Eve? You don't want to be responsible for children waking up Christmas morning without toys under their trees, do you? Time to juggle those cans of paint and get moving!</desc>

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The NES version adds skeet shooting, triple jump, javelin throw, high jump, and archery as events but loses the hammer throw event. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If you want to go to the next event or round then you will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

	<desc>Tunnel Runner" is an advanced 3D Maze Game, essentially what a 1st person version of Pac-Man game would be like.  Because Tunnel Runner was designed with a built-in expanded memory chip (RAM Plus!), it's 12KB of memory gives it the ability to present the maze in three dimensions.  Therefore, the playfield is a colorful, three-dimensional maze, so you never see yourself... just the walls on either side of you that form the corridors you travel along.  As you move along the passage-ways, additional tunnels appear on either side, which you can turn into by pressing left and right.

Your primary goal is to locate and collect the hidden key, located in a different spot within each maze. Through the assistance of a MAP, you can maneuver within the maze. While attempting to locate the key to exit the level, you must also avoid the hungry Zots. You will discover these enemy creatures throughout the maze. Successfully recovering the key without being intercepted by the Zot's opens the portal to the next level. As you pass each level, you will discover that the complexity and difficulty increases, while your MAP gradually reveals less and less information ultimately, your map will be of little use, requiring you to survive solely by instincts and quick thinking!</desc>
	<path>./Turmoil (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of Turmoil is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.

The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds. The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them. Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel. This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway. In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it. If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points. If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.

When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships. If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship. In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time. You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens. There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level. This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.</desc>

The tunnel is broken up into several different zones, called the mountain zone, rainbow zone, stick zone, stripe zone, bleak zone, and City of Mystery. Each zone features different types of enemy spaceships to deal with, and can scroll either horizontally or vertically. In the mountain zone or stripe zone, you may also come across an energy pod marked with an 'E'. If you fly through this, your ship temporarily becomes invincible to the deadly cave walls and numerous enemies which are trying to stop you. When not invincible, your space ship is equipped with lasers to help destroy enemies. You can fire in four different directions, however your speed is decreased when firing. You also need to keep an eye on your fuel gauge; your fuel will deplete at a rapid rate, and your ship will crash if it runs out. Fuel is gained each time you destroy an enemy, so make sure you destroy as many as you can! When you finally make it through all the various zones of the tunnel and defeat Gond, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>

	<path>./Video Chess (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.

To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.

Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square. To carry out the en passant, you must advance your
pawn to the fifth rank. Your opponent then has the option of moving
his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two
squares. If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.

Skill levels
These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.
Level 1=15 seconds
Level 2=30 seconds
Level 3=45 seconds
Level 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds

	<desc>Video Olympics is an action game containing numerous variations of the game Pong. Two players (or one player against the computer) control paddles on the screen and attempt to prevent a bouncing ball from getting past them. In the most basic game variations, each player has a single paddle and there are no obstacles on the screen. The other game variations add paddles and obstacles, and some are loosely inspired by various sports and change the playfield around, but the goal remains the same: hit the ball past your opponents paddle into the goal to earn points. A few of these variations are:

1. Foozpong: Each player controls multiple paddles which are arranged somewhat like a foozball table.

2. Soccer pong: Each player controls two paddles (representing one goalie and one player) and the goal is much narrower.

3. Hockey pong: The playfield is set up to resemble hockey; the goal isn't at the very edge of the screen, so the ball may bounce behind and around the goal.

4. Quadrapong: The goals are located along the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the screen. This game is played by four players, two per team with one person defending each of the four goals.

5. Handball pong: There is no goal, and two players take turns hitting the ball against a solid wall to earn points. One point is earned each time your opponent is unable to return the ball.

6. Volleyball pong: The screen is set up like a volleyball court with a &amp;quot;net&amp;quot; in the middle. Both players are along the bottom of the screen and need to bounce the ball past their opponent.

	<desc>In Wabbit you control farmer Billie Sue who needs to protect her carrot crops! The field is being overrun by rabbits, and you need to chase them away. On each side of the screen are five rabbit holes; the rabbits will come running out of the holes and try to steal the carrots. You need to throw rotten eggs at the rabbits to scare them away. Every time the rabbits get away with a carrot, a point is added to their score. Every time you hit a rabbit with an egg, you will receive points.  For every 100 points you earn, the rabbits will lose 25 points. The game ends when the rabbits have reached 100 points. Several game variations are included which allow one, two, or three rabbits to appear at a time.</desc>

	<path>./Warlords (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Warlords, you need to defend yourself from three human and/or computer players. Each of the four players are in one of the corners of the screen guarded by a castle. You control a small shield which can be moved around the edge of the castle. To survive you need to use the shield to block a ball which bounces around the screen. If the ball hits your castle, it will take out some of the bricks. If a hole forms in the castle wall and the ball makes it though and hits your warlord, then you are out of the game. The last player left alive wins the battle, and the first player to win five battles wins the game! Several game options are included which allow you to either catch or ricochet the ball when the shield touches it, and control the speed of the game.</desc>
	<path>./Warplock (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>You're warping along fine when suddenly you are caught and unable to maneuver. Suddenly, space pirates approach attempting to disable you so they can board. The only thing you have left is your tachyon launcher that moves back and forth and fires a tachyon beam. Hold off the space pirates for as long as you can.

Using your paddle controllers, move the tachyon launcher left or right and press the button to fire a tachyon beam. The beam only travels up. Destroy the pirates and avoid them colliding with you. Sometimes the pirates travel on groups. Destroy any pirate in a group to kill the whole group. You only have one life. Once you die, player two can begin by pressing the button on their paddles or you can press the Reset switch to start a new game.

Game variations
The only variation is one or two player. The difficulty switches are not used.

Scoring
You score one point for each enemy killed. After sixteen points, the enemy start shooting photon shots at you to kill you from more of a distance.</desc>
	<path>./Warring Worms - The Worm (Re)Turns (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>This is the game Warring Worms with several improvements. 

These include:

1. Tank Mode: in this mode, you do not leave a trail behind you when you move.

2. Solid Arena Mode: the obstacles in the arena cannot be destroyed by your cannon, only worm trails or heads.

3. Unbreakable Mode: your cannon only hurts the opponent's head. Nothing else is affected by it.

4. First To: this allows you to set the ending score so game length will be manageable.

5. Sudden Death Mode: in this mode, if any player gets two points ahead of the other, they win.

6. Select Game/Random Game: selecting Random game changes most game options randomly before each round.
</desc>
	<path>./Warring Worms (USA) (Unl).bin</path>
	<desc>Warring Worms is described by its author as "an advanced version of the classic Atari game Surround." Two worms in an arena move forward at all times. You can change direction but never stop. Each worm leaves a wall behind him. You must get your opponent to crash into a wall or barrier but not do so your self. You can also, depending on how your Atari 2600 is set up, shoot the opposing worm's head. The first player to reach ninety-nine points wins.</desc>
	<path>./Wing War (Europe).bin</path>
	<desc>Wing War is an action game where you control a dragon. Beginning in your underground cave, your goal is to capture a sparkling diamond. To do this, you will first need to unlock the secret passage by bringing a fire, water and air crystal back to your cave. Crystals can be found by exploring the various locations available, usually you will need to destroy one of the many enemies so they turn into a crystal. Fire and water crystals can not be in the cave alone at the same time, an air crystal must be placed between them; so you will need to bring back the crystals in the order fire, air, water or water, air, fire. Once you've done this a super crystal is formed unlocking the secret passage so you can try to get the diamond! Your dragon has a limited amount of energy; being hit by enemies will cause the energy to deplete, and the game ends when all of your dragons have lost all their energy.</desc>

	<desc/>
	<path>./Wizard of Wor (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Wizard of Wor is an arcade shooter played from a top-down point of view.

The player controls a warrior who is trapped in a dungeon. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the numerous enemy creatures which wander about the maze like corridors. The creatures wander about at various speeds, may shoot darts at the player, and some even have the ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible.

When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and will only be on the screen momentarily. If the player destroys the creature before it escapes, the next dungeon will become a double score dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points. Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the maze. If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points.

The game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>
	<path>./Word Zapper (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Word Zapper your goal is to zap three words in 99 seconds. First, the current word will appear at the bottom of the screen. You then have to recreate this word by controlling your spaceship and zapping letters in the correct order which will be scrolling by at the top of the screen. To make this task more challenging, various asteroids will fly by horizontally; some asteroids will cause you to lose time, others destroy your ship ending the game. To help protect yourself, your spaceship is also equipped with lasers which can be used to destroy the asteroids. If you shoot five asteroids in a row, you earn a &amp;quot;freebie&amp;quot; which can be used in place of any letter. You will also need to use the &amp;quot;freebie&amp;quot; to move on to the next word after all the necessary letters have been zapped. The game ends when you successfully zap three words, the time limit runs out, or your spaceship is destroyed by asteroids. Numerous game variations are available. These control the speed and density of the asteroids, the speed of the scrolling alphabet, and allow you to choose between zapping words or random letters.</desc>

	<desc>NEWS FLASH: GIANT WORMS ATTACK THE CITY OF TERIYAKI!

You command a tank at the bottom of the screen. You can move left or right but you are always moving forward. You can control the forward speed by pushing up or down on the joystick.

As worms move back and forth you must shoot them so they don't touch your tank. Also shoot any blocks in you path. Try not to shoot fuel pagodas. Touch them to refuel. You can go to the far left or right of the screen and not get touched by a worm but you can't shoot them when you are there either.

In the two player games, you have selections on co-operative or competitive. In co-op, you have the same points and fuel tank. When one tank refuels, it refuels both. In competitive, you each have a score and fuel tank. You compete to get enemies and fuel.</desc>
	<path>./Xenophobe (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>Xenos.  The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart.  A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos.

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld. Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it. You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987. Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</desc>
	<path>./X-Man (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>This game has nothing to do with any character from Marvel.

You are the super stud, the X-Man. The object is to make your way through a random maze, avoiding either crabs, scissors or teeth, to get to the hottie behind the door in the middle of the maze. You have 90 seconds to get there.

Once you reach the babe, you enter the Sexy Surprise where you must then give her sex to make her reach orgasm. You have 30 seconds to satisfy her then it is off to the next maze.

Your points are the amount of time remaining after you reach the maze center and climax her times ten and 20 points for each increment of the sexual excitement meter.. You must have the left difficulty switch in the A position to play. Set it to B to pause. Reset restarts the game. Select and the right difficulty switch are not used.</desc>

	<path>./Yars' Revenge (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>In Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</desc>
	<path>./Zaxxon (USA).bin</path>
	<desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

	<desc>This cartridge contains six of the 1 kilobyte entries and one 4 kilobyte entry from the 2005 Minigame Competition with an onscreen menu for selecting the games. The games are:

1. Hunchy: inspired by the Century Electronics game Hunchback, the player takes the role of Quasimodo and must rescue Esmeralda from the cathedral of Notre Dame. Quasimoto can jump across the roof, avoiding guards and assorted missiles.

2. Jetman: inspired by the 8-bit computer game Jetpac, the player must fuel a rocket but avoid getting shot from an unseen attacker.

3. Nightrider: the player is running from a hostile government. They are pursuing you with a helicopter. Just keep running and watch out for the terrain. The farther and longer along the Nightrider goes, the more freedom is worth.

4. Zirconium: an alien race, not carbon-based but zirconium-based, have invaded the galaxy. They have set space mines to protect their mothership. The player takes the role of Captain Joe Diamond, and must fight his way through these mines and destroy the mothership. Careful about hitting mines, as the ship can only take so many blows. Grab any power packs you can.

5. Rocket Command: magma beings are invading from the inside of a volcano. As the rocket commander, the player must destroy these beings' ships before they launch into the sky.

6. M-4: a port of a 1977 Midway arcade game of the same name. The player has unlimited lives and 90 seconds to destroy all that is seen for points. Points are awarded for hitting the wall, the opponent tank, a car and an airplane. If the player or the opponent are hit, the wall is rebuilt and both are returned to thier starting points, but the clock never pauses.

7. Marble Jumper: this is a puzzle game where the object is to clear the board of all but 1 marble, with the last one being in the middle. There are 33 squares and 16 marbles. The player clears marbles by jumping them vertically or horizontally, like in checkers. Diagonal jumps are not allowed.</desc>

	<path>./3-D Tic-Tac-Toe (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>3-D Tic-Tac-Toe is, as the name implies, a 3D version of Tic-Tac-Toe. The object of the game is to place four X's or four O's in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row on the 4x4 board.

There are nine games of which the first eight games are for
one human player against the computer. The numbers 1-8 represent the skill level. Game 9 is a two player game. In the DOS version there are only two difficulty settings and no two player game.</desc>
	<path>./Acid Drop (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>A falling block game similar to Columns. The object of the game is to create a horizontal or vertical line of three or more blocks of the same color, which will then disappear. The remaining blocks will fall down, but won't disappear if they form another line. Every 10,000 points a special block will appear (the Acid Drop) which removes three columns of blocks and marks the beginning of the next level.</desc>
	<path>./Actionauts (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc>The object of Actionauts is to program your robot to perform a series of commands. Use the joystick to set the commands to make the robot walk through a path. On the Commodore 64, you can alter the grid to change the path, the programming is mainly done on the same page and you can select from four robot designs. On the Atari 2600, you select from preset mazes, the programming is on a second screen and you are trying to reach the 'cheese' goal.</desc>
	<path>./Activision Decathlon, The (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. 

The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.

For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.</desc>
	<path>./Adventure (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>A graphic dungeon quest inspired by the old mainframe game of the same name, Adventure is a graphic adventure where you use your joystick to wander around, collecting keys to explore castles, labyrinths and everything in between, whilst slaying anything that moves (i.e. Dragons &amp; Co.) to get treasures. 

The game has 3 difficulty settings:

1. Level 1 (Easiest)
2. Level 2: The Kingdom is larger than Level 1, containing secret rooms and hidden items to add difficulty.
3. Level 3 (Hardest): Similar to Level 2 but all objects/items are placed randomly throughout the Kingdom.

Gameplay revolves around picking up (and dropping) items, hacking your way though dragons, finding keys to open the castle gates and using magic (i.e. reincarnation) in case you get swallowed by failing-to-follow-their-diet-plan-dragons.</desc>
	<path>./Adventures of TRON (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Adventures of Tron is based on the motion picture TRON from Walt Disney Productions.

The game environment consists of 4 floors, each with flying "bits" as well as enemy MCP attackers. The objective of the game is to control TRON (you) in a maze of platforms and elevators while trying to intercept the flying bits (intercepting bits on higher floors are awarded higher points).

Dodge enemy MCP attackers by jumping, using elevators and hitching a ride on the Silver Sailor. Capturing all 7 "bits" will take you to the next level, with added speed and difficulty.

You have a total of 4 lives in play. Make each one count!</desc>
	<path>./Air Raid (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen.

There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends.

The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much damage that they collapse.

There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of these.</desc>
	<path>./Air Raiders (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Goal of the game is to shoot as many enemies as possible (only visible from the side) while avoiding being shot down by flak cannons (which can cause a drop by up to 15 altitude) and to land safely again before the fuel runs out. If more than ten enemies have been shot it is possible to take off again with an ammo equal to the number of enemies being hit.</desc>
	<path>./Airlock (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The player is trapped in a crashed nuclear submarine which has begun taking on water. They need to escape by making their way up the levels of the submarine one at a time. Each floor has two hatch keys that need to be collected in order to unlock the elevator to the next level. There is a time limit, though; if you take too long the floor will flood and you'll be unable to escape. Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes. The player will need to jump over any torpedoes that cross their path, or they will be stunned momentarily and lose precious time.</desc>
	<path>./Air-Sea Battle (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game.  On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen.  The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.

In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft. You are stationary. Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile. 

In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above. On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen. Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above. Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired.

In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again. This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits). The controls are as in games 1-6. 

In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above. Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed. When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired. 

In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below. The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18. The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below. 

In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.

Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds. (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets. I have yet to see this happen.) In each of the single player games, the single player tries to outscore a computer opponent that simply constantly fires.</desc>
	<path>./Alfred Challenge (France) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>As Alfred, you must run, jump and climb ladders to reach keys to open the doors to get to the next level. Watch out for Tazniak and the Bukoï as they are out to kill you. Do not dally, as you have a limited time to complete a screen. There are three screens and a hidden screen.</desc>
	<path>./Alien (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In this game based, loosely, on the movie of the same name, you have to move through a maze (the halls of your ship in the manual), ala Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs). 

If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot (pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.

After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.</desc>

	<desc>As waves of aliens attack, you must kill them all before you are killed yourself. There are eight different aliens, each with different moves and attacks. Your ship is at the bottom middle of the screen. You do not move. Instead, when you push left or right, the enemies shift to that side.</desc>
	<path>./Alligator People, The (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc>This game is based on a 1959 20th Century Fox horror/sci-fi movie of the same name. You are Jane Marvin. Your finance and five of your friends are turning into alligators due to a failed medical experiment. You must get the alligator antidote to cure them.

You, as a syringe, must move about the screen, gathering antidotes and serums. Serums supposedly increase the strength of the antidote so you need less to cure someone. You must then aim at the infected person at the top or bottom of the screen and press your button to inject them. The longer you take to get the antidote to them, the more they will mutate and the more antidote it will require to cure them. Everything is not so simple, however, as there are normal alligators in the swamp and you will lose you a life if they touch you. You can shoot to kill them and it will not cost you an antidote.

Some variations have walls that move. These make it harder to see the alligators, antidotes and serums. Serums only appear in variations with walls. Some variations allow you to pass through the walls, others will make the walls solid and they can crush you if you get between two closing ones. Once you cure all six friends, it is off to the next level.</desc>

	<desc>Ernie's ship has run out of fuel and it is up to you to help him.

Use the buttons of the controller to move your ship left or right and beam letters to the correct slots on Ernie's ship. Once all the letters are in place, Ernie can fly away.

This game helps kids learn to recognize letters and match capital letters to lower case and recognize easy-to-confuse letters.

The game manual also contained a read-aloud story.

	<path>./Artillery Duel (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In this two player game each player controls an artillery gun set in a mountain landscape with the goal of destroying the other player. Players take turns firing at each other; on each turn you have a limited amount of time in which the barrel angle and powder level can be set in order to control the direction and distance of the shot. When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of time you have to make a shot.</desc>

	<desc>Inspired by a calculator game called DStar, collect all the items on the screen in the fewest moves. Your character can only move in one direction until he hits something then he can change directions. If you collect all items on each screen without exceeding the minimum moves required, you win the game. If you exceed the minimum moves for your screen, a tone will sound and the score area will change color. You will not be stopped but you will not have been counted as won.</desc>

Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon. When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.

The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.

Game Difficulty and Variations
There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 

The game also offers three different game variations:

1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.

2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.

3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.

Scoring
The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.

1. Small saucer - 1,000 points
2. Other player's ship - 500 points
3. Large saucer - 200 points
4. Small asteroid - 100 points
5. Medium asteroid - 50 points
6. Large asteroid - 20 points</desc>

	<path>./Atari Video Cube (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In this game, you control Marvin the Cube Master. You move him around a six-sided cube with nine squares to a side.
The object is to get all nine sides to be one color each in the least amount of time or fewest moves, depending on the game variation you select.

Marvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire button. Marvin will then exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot move onto a space of the same color as he is.

To rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the direction to rotate.

The game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest moves.
Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it rotates, so you don't know what color your on.
Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict you rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces.

Eight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.</desc>
	<path>./A-Team, The (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc>If The A-Team looks familiar it's because it is little more than a graphic hack of another unreleased Atari game called Saboteur.  At one point it was thought these games were the same except for the graphics, but after analyzing them I've found some slight gameplay differences.  On this page I'll concentrate on the differences between Saboteur and The A-Team, for more information on the gameplay itself look at the Saboteur page.  

It's unknown why Atari decided to change Saboteur into The A-Team, but we assume it's because they wanted a game based on the then popular A-Team TV show and didn't want to wait for a new game to be developed. At that point Saboteur was ready for release and Atari decided that they would attempt to integrate A-Team characters into a game that was already finished. The results are interesting at best, confusing to say the least.</desc>

	<desc>The lost city of Atlantis is under attack! Wave after wave of Gorgon vessels are approaching, each armed with weapons capable of destroying a part of the city. You are in charge of the command posts at the edges of the city and need to defend it from the invaders. The various gorgon craft will keep flying by on the screen in varying numbers and in different flight patterns. At first they fly high in the sky but then progressively lower. If an enemy makes it low enough before you destroy it, it will use it's weapons and destroy one of the buildings in Atlantis. As you progress in the game, the enemy craft will keep increasing in speed. The game ends when all remaining buildings in the city have been destroyed.</desc>

	<desc>This game is based on the first two screens of the Commodore 64 version of Aztec Challenge.

On the first screen, you are running the Gauntlet. Your character runs towards the horizon, from which a pyramid arises as you go, while spears shoot from left or right. You must jump or duck the spears by pushing up or down on the joystick.

After you clear the Gauntlet, you must run up the Stairs of the pyramid while the priests throw stones down at you. You must push left or right to avoid these stones hitting you.

Using the left difficulty switch, you can select to play one level after another of the Gauntlet or play level one of Gauntlet followed by level one of Stairs then level two and so on. The right difficulty switch selects music or sounds.</desc>

	<path>./Backfire (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>The year is 2947. Earth is being invaded by the evil Kcaj clan from the Yenrut galaxy. You are Galactic Commander Frank Drexor. The United States Space Guard has commissioned you with the task of defending the most important sector of the galaxy from the invaders. Kcaj technology is much more advanced than the technology of Earth. Some of the ships have tractor beams. Others are equipped with subspace energy disruptors. These disruptors create energy barriers that will actually cause the shots from your cannons to reflect back at you! If your mission is a failure, the Kcaj will gain control of this vital sector of space, allowing them to maneuver their troops and equipment much more efficiently and gain a larger foothold in the battle for the planet. This would certainly spell disaster for the citizens of Earth. Their fate is in your hands! 

You have a gun on the top of the screen and one on the bottom, each of which travel left or right. To switch between weapons, just press the joystick up or down. You must be careful when you fire because if you shoot your own gun, you will lose a life. There is a yellow spaceship that starts on the row next to the middle row and moves across the screen. Each time it reaches the screen, it moves one row closer to one side. If it gets to your gun, you lose as life. Later in the game, barriers appear in the playing field. You must be careful when these are there as they will reflect your gun's shots back, losing you a life if they hit. In the center, at times, there is a UFO colored either red, blue or green. The red is worth one-hundred points, the blue grants and extra life and the green resets the difficulty to level one without removing the points. Play simply continues until you lose all your lives.</desc>
	<path>./Backgammon (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in this manual.

Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:
All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.
No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.
A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.
After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.
If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.

Difficulty switches
Right:
A=computer rolls dice for you
B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers
Left:
A=computer sets up the board for you
B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

Game variations
Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player
Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player

Games one through four are backgammon
Games five through eight are acey deucey

Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 have a doubling cube.</desc>
	<path>./Bank Heist (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are a bank robber, driving around a maze of streets (representing the city) in a 1930's style car.  Your purpose is clear: perform "bank heists" by driving across white-pillared symbols that represent banks.  As you "rob" each of the banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its place, beginning hot pursuit after a few moments.  You must avoid the cops to stay alive.  Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite, which you can strategically drop to destroy the cop cars.

Besides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to another (as in Pac-Man), there is an additional tunnel that represents the road out of town. By taking it, you will find yourself in the next city. Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and smarter.

There are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one. Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to town, navigating the mazes of streets, and robbing as many of the banks in each town as you are able to. This keeps your gas supply high, and the money rolling in! If you run out of gas, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Barnstorming (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Barnstorming, you are the pilot of a biplane. Your point of view is from the side as the screen scrolls by horizontally. Your goal is to fly through a set number of barns in the shortest amount of time possible. Several obstacles will appear in your way, including flocks of geese, windmills, and weather vanes. Crashing into any of these will cause you to lose speed which will increase your overall time. There are several difficulty levels included which will require that you fly through anywhere from 10 to 25 barns.</desc>

	<desc>A very simple math game for kids.

Each game of Basic Math gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a function, and inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is available to ramp up the difficulty. The game has eight primary game settings - basically two settings for each mathematical function. Games 1 - 4 allow you to select one of the numbers you will be working with, while 5 - 8 give random questions. 

Hint: For division problems that have a remainder make sure to put a space between the whole number and the remainder, which goes to the right.</desc>

	<desc>Atari Games' 3D tank game was ground-breaking when released to the arcades, and as such was converted officially to many systems. Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.</desc>
	<path>./Beamrider (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Beamrider is a 3-D arcade action game. You control a beam riding spaceship on a mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occassionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</desc>
	<path>./Beany Bopper (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In this game, you are Bopper.

The object is to stun then capture Beannies. You can also capture Bouncing Orange Eyeballs and various Falling Objects.

If an unstunned Beanny touches you, you lose a life. You don't need to stun the other items to capture them but doing so makes them slow down.

You get a bonus Bopper by shooting four Beannies in a row without losing a Bopper.

There are two game options, one where the Beannies bounce off the walls on screen, the other where they pass through.</desc>

	<desc>In this children's learning game, you play as the Berenstain bear called Brother. On your unicycle, first you must avoid hitting stones in the road. Then you will be in the forest, where, depending on the cassette you have selected, you will have to catch the correct numbers, letters or the letters to spell a certain word.

After you catch the required items, you then move on and either have to dodge stones again or cross one or two bridges that open and close.

If you hit a stone, catch the wrong falling item or don't get across the bridge(s) in time, you get a warning sound but do not lose a life. You can play non-stop until you choose to stop.</desc>

	<desc>This release of Berzerk is an alteration of the official Atari 2600 version. Some minor tweaks were done like altering the color and graphics to more closely resemble the arcade version but most notable was that the arcade game voices were added in, saying things like "Intruder alert! Intruder alert!" and "Chicken, fight like a robot!".

The game play is the same. Eliminate robots on the screen. Do not touch them or the walls or you die. Do not let them shoot you. Do not linger in a maze or Evil Otto will come after you and he cannot be stopped so you would have to run.</desc>

	<desc>Big Bird wants to win the county fair egg contest and you can help him.

A chicken at the top will lay and egg and it will go down a chute. You must get Big Bird under the correct chute to catch the egg.

Game one is one player only. Games two through ten are one or two player. All games have two rounds.

Game one is a practice round. There are two chickens, straight chutes and when you move Big Bird left or right, he pops right under the chute.

Games two and three have three then four chutes and the game gets faster in the second round. Game two's chutes are straight, game three's zig-zag. Big Bird still pops under a chute.

Games four, five and six have three rounds. There will be eleven white eggs dropped and one golden egg. Games four starts with two zig-zagging chutes in the first round and four in the second. Game five has two crisscrossing chutes in the first round, four in the second. Game six has four crisscrossing chutes in both rounds. Big Bird no longer pops under the chute but must be positioned correctly.

Games seven has eleven white eggs and one golden egg dropping per round with unlimited rounds. There are five broken eggs on the bottom left and you do rounds until you miss so many eggs you are out of broken eggs. when you catch the golden egg, in addition to points, you get an extra broken egg.

Game eight is the same as game seven except you can't see an egg in the chute, only when it pops out the bottom.

Games nine and ten are the same as game seven but the chutes shrink up in the direction of the hens. This means you must memorize when the chute comes out for which chicken. In game nine, the chutes are all the same for each round. In game ten, the patterns change per round.

Each white egg caught is worth one point, each golden egg, five.

For ages three to seven.</desc>

	<desc>Your girlfriend Daisy is in trouble! Ollie Org is chasing her across the top of the screen, and you need to come to the rescue. To stop Ollie before time runs out, you need to construct a machine. The blue print for the machine is at the bottom of the screen, so all you need to do is locate the parts which are hidden in the numerous houses in a maze like town. When you locate a part, drag it back and place it on the blue print. When all parts have been located, press the start button and the machine is ready to go! To make your task more difficult, there are several obstacles that get in the way. If you enter a house which doesn't contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a bomb. You will need to hurry and diffuse any bombs in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to time, a flower pot will fall from above and then hop off the screen. Get hit by a flower pot, and you lose a life. You also need to be careful of Fuzzy Wuzzy, who wanders around the neighborhood randomly. An encounter with Fuzzy Wuzzy will also be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete; while he isn't deadly, he will occasionally appear and press the start button before your machine is complete. If this happens, you will need to drag Pete back to the bomb pit and reassemble all of the machine parts.</desc>

	<desc/>
	<path>./Boing! (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>This is a game rather reminiscent of Q*bert.

In this game, you are a bubble named, with great originality, Bubble.
The object here is to bounce on each of the thirty-six squares and turn them all on. You start at the bottom left. On the bottom right starts the Bubble Eater. He will chase you around the play field and if he catches you, you lose one of your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost.

The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is popped, it turns into a glowing puddle for a short time. While it is a puddle, you can bounce on it without getting hurt.

Game variations
The game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three.

Levels
There are 5 waves per level.
Level 1: The Bubble can bounce on any square and it will turn on and stay on.
Level 2: The same as level 1 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.
Level 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce on it again it turns off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on again.
Level 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.

Scoring
You get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave.
You score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points even if you are turning on a step a repeatedly.
You get points for completing a level and/or wave. The amount varies by what level or wave you completed.</desc>

Touch Me: The computer will play a sequence of tones. Each button on the controller represents a different tone, and by pressing the correct button you need to recreate the same sequence.

Count Me: The computer will display a sequence of numbers. Using the controller, you need to press the numbered buttons in the same order the computer displayed them.

Picture Me: The computer will display a series of symbols. It will then scramble the order they are displayed in, and you need to reorder the symbols back into their original configuration.

Find Me: The computer will display a series of objects on the screen, and you need to select the object which is dissimilar from the others. Your score is based on how fast you can successfully do this.

Add Me: The computer will display a list of numbers. You need to enter in the sum of the numbers before the timer runs out.

Play Me: This game allows you to play your own songs in free form mode; each button on the controller represents a musical note. Both controllers can be used for a duet, and several example songs are included in the instruction manual.</desc>

To do this, you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen which is used to reflect a bouncing ball into the bricks. When the ball hits a brick, it will destroy it. You start with five balls, and the game ends when all five fall off the bottom of the screen. Also included are several game variations, including breakthru (the ball will go straight through bricks instead of bouncing back), timed breakout (you have a time limit to gain as many points as you can), and invisible breakout (the bricks are only visible for a short while after one of them is hit).  Other variations allow you to catch the ball or control the direction of the ball.</desc>

For each game, you can choose to play to either 13, 21, 25, or 29 points. After a hand is finished, you have the option of replaying the same hand if you want to practice, or you can have the computer deal a new hand. If you don't like the way a hand is going, you have the option of restarting the hand to try again. Included with the game instructions is a complete guide to how your computer partner will bid in different situations in order to help you form your strategy. Bridge was designed for people who already know how to play the game, it won't teach you how to play.</desc>

As the bugs come out of the ground, you must place your crosshair below them and fire. When the Phylanx appears, it will be green then will go dark green then red. When it turns red, it will move back and forth across the screen. If a bug gets all the way out of its nest or your crosshair is touched by a red Phylanx, you lose a life. Then, if in a two player game, it is player two's turn.

Once the carrot is stolen, Elmer's hound will dig where the carrot was, forcing you to come above ground. You must then make your way to the hole the hound dug and dive in to safety before Elmer blasts you. Once you have cleared all three levels, it is on to the next screen. If Elmer shoots you three times, the game is over. In a two player game, one player is Bugs, the other is Elmer.</desc>

You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.</desc>

	<path>./BurgerTime (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.

The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.</desc>

	<desc/>
	<path>./Centipede (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. 

The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:

1. One Player
Two Player Alternating
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.
Dual Player Competition
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.
Team Play
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.

Scoring

	<desc>Checkers is a computerized version of the popular board game and follows the same rules; the object of the game is to remove all of your opponents pieces from the 8x8 game board. This is accomplished by moving your pieces diagonally forward on the board; an opponents piece is removed from play if one of your pieces jumps over it (if any of your pieces are able to jump an opponents piece, you must make that move). When beginning the game pieces can only move in a diagonal forward direction until they reach the other side of the board; that piece then becomes &amp;quot;kinged&amp;quot; allowing movement both forwards and backwards. The game can be played by one player against the computer (with three skill levels available) or two players against each other.</desc>

	<desc>The Spectra Island reactor provides power for millions of residents. Ordinarily, there is no problem but there has been an earthquake. This has damaged the reactor, causing it to release radioactive particles. You must use the robot arm to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too much and we have a meltdown.

There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red, blue and yellow. You start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm.

If you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.</desc>

Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.</desc>

After each guess, the computer analyzes your input and displays results which indicate if you have a correct digit in the correct position, a correct digit in the wrong position, or no correct digits at all. Points are scored based on how many turns it takes to correctly identify the code. A second game variation called Nim is also included. In this game, two players take turns removing items from a stack. On each turn, a player must take at least one item from a stack, and the player who removes the last item from the screen wins.

If the enemies get to be too much, press fire to activate the Mega Blaster and destroy all the enemies on the screen.. Be advised that you only have three shots for the Mega Blaster. If the colony or cannons are destroyed, the game is over.

The Jarvian ships are:

1. The Fighter: This is the most common and several attack at once, firing at the shield and colony and, sometimes, your cannon.

2. The Advisor: This will cause the Fighters to target faster so remove it as soon as you can.

3. The Bomber: This one will not target the shield but will try to bomb your cannon. Shoot it and/or it's bombs before they reach their target.

4. The Scout: This one will call in replacement ships so see to it that he doesn't stay long.</desc>

	<desc>The year is 2037. Nations no longer fight monster wars, killing millions. Instead, two combatants enter an arena and fight for their countries honor.

This is a sequel to the 1977 game Combat however, there are no planes, just tanks and missiles. Each player starts in a base in a corner, one in the upper left, the other in the lower right. You must seek out your opponent and shoot them three times to destroy their tank. If they are under trees or, in another game variation, behind walls, you must shoot the trees/walls out of the way first to reach them. Each player has three tanks. The winner is the last one standing.

If you are still in your base, you can press the button to fire a homing missile that will seek out you opponent. When the homing missile hits, it counts as two shots. Missiles must reload between shots and the reloading time is several seconds. If a tank is not hit for several seconds, the 'crew' will affect repairs.

The eggs will slowly hatch into various creatures which fly down and try to bomb or crash into your canon. If you destroy the Mother Creature as well as all of the mutants on the screen, you will move on to the next, more difficult level. Several game options are included which allow you to enable or disable a shield, guided fire, a time warp to temporarily slow down the game, and penetrating fire allowing you to take out several mutants with one shot.</desc>

	<path>./Cookie Monster Munch (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Cookie Monster hungry! Want cookie!

You are moving around a maze, collecting cookies and bringing them back to a cookie jar.

Games one through three are one player, games four through ten are one or two player.

In games one, two and three, you move Cookie Monster around the maze, get the cookies and return them to the cookie jar, one at a time. Between mazes, Cookie Monster eats each cookie, one at a time. There are three mazes per game. In game one, there are one, two then three cookies. In game two, four, five then six and in game three, seven, eight the nine.

Games four through six are timed. You can carry multiple cookies and keep playing mazes until time runs out. In games four, five and six, you have five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Games seven through nine are also timed but now you play as the Cookie Kid. You are trying to collect cookies for a surprise party for Cookie Monster. Since he hasn't been told this, he is pacing back and forth on the other side on the fence. Each time you pick up a cookie, Cookie Monster jumps over the fence and chases you. He will each and cookies of the path he is coming down and if he catches you, he will eat all the cookies you are carrying. The times for games seven, eight and nine are five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Game ten in the same as game nine (three minute time limit, you are Cookie Kid and chased by Cookie Monster) except the maze is invisible. When you pick up a cookie, the maze flashes for a second so you can figure out the fastest route to take.

You get one point per cookie in the jar.

For ages three to seven.</desc>
	<path>./Cosmic Ark (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The Alpha Ro solar system is in crisis! Their sun is about to go supernova, meaning the death of all the many planets and the exotic lifeforms who call them home. Luckily, though, the noble Atlanteans have heard of Alpha Ro's plight and have sent a vast Cosmic Ark thousands of light-years across the galaxy to try and save as many species as possible. As the captain of the Ark, the player will have to contend with deadly meteor storms and planetary defense systems to succeed the mission.

Cosmic Ark features two play screens: On the first, the player will have to blast meteors with four-way cannons. Blast enough and the player can go on to the second screen. The Ark descends low over one of Alpha Ro's planets. The player will then have to guide a shuttle craft down and beam aboard two creatures, while avoiding any laser defense system that may be in operation. The player will have to get the creatures back on board quickly, because another meteor shower could happen at any moment. Then it's off to the next planet!</desc>
	<path>./Cosmic Commuter (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Cosmic Commuter takes place in the year 2075. You work for the Galactic Travel Agency, and need to help the citizens commute to and from work! Each level consists of several parts. First, you must successfully land the rocket module on the planet surface (this contains your astrobus). This part of the game is similar to the game Lunar Lander; you must control the speed of the lander to make sure you don't crash! In the second, horizontally scrolling segment you control the astrobus and attempt to pick up the commuters at the bus stops. Once all of the commuters are picked up, return to the rocket module and take off to transport the commuters to the grand central space station. Of course, there are many obstacles which can prevent a successful mission. Meteors, fireballs and space mines all get in the way and can destroy your astrobus. Your astrobus is equipped with a laser that can be used to destroy these obstacles. The astrobus also has a limited amount of fuel; if you start running out you better find more fuel before you crash!</desc>
	<path>./Cosmic Creeps (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Civilization is doomed! You are our last hope! You must protect the Cosmic Kids from the Cosmic Creeps as they escape the orbit-decaying planet!

The first part of the game is The Voyage. You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay a little more

The second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.

If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety. You need to score 5000 points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you will start the Voyage again, only faster.</desc>

	<path>./Cosmic Swarm (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are at the Waypoint Interstellar Trade Depot, a quiet outpost in space, when suddenly a dormant group of alien, mineral-eating termites awakens. They then begin haphazardly making their nest.

Using your probe ship, you must destroy the termites and their nest blocks. You simply fire at the termites to destroy them but their nest blocks must be energized before you can destroy them. To energize a nest block, you must hit a block while a termite is still carrying it. This will energize all the blocks on the screen.

If you shoot a termite that is not carrying a block or if one is carrying a block but you only hit the termite, all the blocks will not be energized and not be damageable. If you run into a block, energized or not, or are touched by a termite, you lose a life.

Every so often, a refuel ship travels down and then back up the left or right side of the screen. You must dock with it (touch it) before it gets back to the top or the game ends, no matter how many lives you have left.

To fire, press the fire button. To move, move the joystick while the button is not pressed. If you hold down the button, you can rotate left or right then you will stay at that angle until you rotate again.

The points are:
Shooting a termite that is NOT carrying a block=1 point
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block but only hitting the termite=2 points
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block and hitting the block=3 points
Shooting an energized block=1 point</desc>
	<path>./Crack'ed (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc>As a professional ornithologist, you're thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills have nested in your "old yolk tree." But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.

You get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site.</desc>
	<path>./Crackpots (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>A barrage of bugs are attacking your home, and you need to defend it with potted plants! You control your character at the top of the screen where there are six potted plants. These can be dropped on the bugs to destroy them as they make their way up from the sewer at the bottom. Just beneath the potted plants are six windows; you need to make sure you destroy the bugs before they can reach these windows. If six of the bugs make it into the windows, a layer of your house will be eaten. This will drop you one step closer to the bottom of the screen, making it more difficult to destroy the incoming bugs! The game ends when six layers of the building have been eaten. There are four different color bugs in the game, each of which have a different pattern of movement. As the levels progress, bugs will keep coming faster and faster!</desc>
	<path>./Crash Dive (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The object of this game is to use your flying sub, the Sea Hunter,  to destroy enemies and get treasures.

You move fastest when in the air, half speed when in the water and cannot move forward when on the sea bottom.

Your enemies and their point values are:
Plane = 300
Helicopter = 100
Bird = 0
Boat = 50
Sting Ray = 20
Shark = 100
Angler Fish = 200
Squid = 100
Lobster = 25

You get 1 point for stunning the sea monster but cannot kill him. You cannot do anything with mines but avoid them.

The possible treasures and their point values are:
Sword = 200
Wine Bottle = 400
Sunken Boat = 500
Crown = 1000
Chalice = 2000
Pot of Gold = 3000
Key = 5000

You just play until you crash your sub or run out of fuel. You refuel by docking with the sub at the top of the sea (looks like a boat without a gun) called Sea View.</desc>
	<path>./Crazy Balloon (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>In this game, you try to get your balloon from one point to the end of a spike-walled maze, without popping it. Your balloon constantly sways back and forth so you must be cautious. You cannot take all day because you are timed, as well. To make matters worse, in the later levels, you face moving spikes, Hurricane Man, who will try to blow you into a wall, and magnets that try to drag you into the wall. There are sixteen levels total.</desc>
	<path>./Crazy Climber (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.

The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects, another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 

Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.</desc>

	<desc>When attending a football game, you had a valet park your vehicle. Unfortunately, the valet was a little disgruntled as he wanted to see the game himself. To take out his frustration, he has parked the cars so yours cannot be driven out until the mess is fixed.

This is a shifting-pieces puzzle game where you move the white cars out of the way so the horizontal white car, in line with the exit, has a clear path. Place the circle cursor onto the end of a white car and press the button to turn it from red to green. Then move the joystick to move the car forwards or backwards. You cannot move them sideways or turn them. Once you have cleared a path, put the cursor on the car you need to leave with and drive it to the exit. Free the car in the fewest moves in twenty-six levels.</desc>

	<desc>It seems as if forever that the evil Morplus from the planet Tzoris have terrorized the galaxy, leaving death and destruction in their wake. But now, our scientists have developed our newest weapon, the Spectron! You will be deployed with this weapon and must destroy as many Morplus as you can.

You have two lasers, one at the top that fires down and one at the bottom that fires up. You control both lasers. Depending on what you select, you can have both lasers stay parallel to each other or move opposite of each other. Your goal is to fire the laser, which fires from one laser to the other, and destroy any enemies caught in your crossfire. The mothership that drops the enemies is indestructible.

Be aware, however, that if you fire you weapon non-stop, it will overheat and then will not fire until it cools a little. Also be aware of the amount of fuel you have because if you run out of fuel, you lose one life. You need to shoot any red fuel pods when they appear on screen.</desc>
	<path>./Crossbow (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Crossbow, you and several friends are trying to cross many treacherous landscapes in order to retrieve stolen treasures from the castle of the Evil Master. All of the members of your party are unarmed, however you carry a crossbow. Using this, you need to shoot any obstacles or hostile enemies that may get in the way of your friends as they cross the screen. You see the landscape from a first person point of view, and one by one each member of the party will walk from the left to right on the screen. There are many different landscapes that need to be crossed, each with its own variety of dangers. There are deserts with scorpions, ice caverns, jungles with hostile monkeys, a lava spewing volcano, and even the heavily guarded castle. The game starts with two friends in your party, with additional friends joining after clearing certain parts of the game. The game ends when everyone in your party has been killed.</desc>
	<path>./Crypts of Chaos (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>This is a role playing game, sort of.

The object is to kill monsters in the crypts and get any treasure you can find and get out on the crypts.

How deep in the crypt you start depends on the game selection. Games one, two, three, or four place you at levels five, nine, thirteen, or one, respectively.

Your weapons are a sword (unlimited attacks but useless against wizards), wand (limited attacks, depending on game selection, useless on dragons), ring of power (limited attacks, depending on game selection), and peace symbol (unlimited uses but you get no points and only useful on trolls, eyes, wizards and dragons).

Your enemies are trolls, frogs, snakes, skulls, blobs, eyes, wizards and dragons. Level one has only trolls, level two has trolls and frogs, level three has trolls, frogs and snakes, etc. up to level eight and below which has everything.</desc>
	<path>./Crystal Castles (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Bentley Bear is trapped in the Crystal Castles! To get out, he will need to collect all of the gems located throughout the castle. The game is played with an isometric view of the multi platformed castle. When Bentley collects all of the gems on the current castle, he will move on to the next, more difficult castle. Wandering throughout the castles are a wide variety of dangerous creatures, which Bentley should avoid. From time to time, a magic hat will appear. If Bentley collects the hat, he will temporarily be invincible to the castles inhabitants.</desc>

	<desc>It's a battle for survival in an underground cavern!  You have five men. They enter the cavern one at a time through the center trap door.  Once inside, blobs, spiders and robots begin to enter the left and right doors. (Neither the creatures nor the man can exit through these doors.)

Direct your man down the tunnels. Pick up ammunition as you go. Keep clear of the creatures... avoid robot fire. Shoot to destroy! Get hit by a robot's bullet... action stops.

Now bring out your next man... get them before they get you!!!</desc>
	<path>./Dark Chambers (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Dark Chambers is an arcade action game similar to Gauntlet. You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can. Hidden somewhere in each of the levels is an exit which will take you on to the next level. Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

	<desc>Who knew? You thought you could play cards better than that when drunk. But now you've done it. You lost King Roland the Insane's black rose in a card game with the Dark Mage so you've been banished. The only way you can go home again is to find and return that black rose.

Use a joystick to take items, talk to characters and go places to find the king's rose.
Inspired by text-based games like those released by Infocom, you do not type here. Instead, you move the joystick to change the selection at the bottom of the screen then press the button to select.</desc>
	<path>./Deadly Duck (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are Deadly Duck and the object is to shoot your bill bullets at crabs, the bricks they drop and dragonflies.

Each level starts with eight crabs. The crabs grab bricks from the sides and try to drop them on you. You can shoot the bricks as they fall and the crabs but if a brick lands on you, you're a dead duck.
When a brick lands, it will stay on the pond for a moment, blocking you from moving horizontally.

On levels two to four, you have two, four and six dragonflies, respectively, moving together just under the crabs. You get ten points for shooting the dragonflies but this makes them angry. They then drop one, two or three bombs (depending on the level). If you are next to a bomb when it explodes, your goose is cooked.

The game continues until you lose all you ducks.

It's all enough to make you quack up.</desc>
	<path>./Death Trap (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You have been sent to deliver a message. Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.

IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)

You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.

As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).

After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.

You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.

Game variations
After you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.

The difficulty settings are:
Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.
Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.
Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.

The difficulty switches are not used.
After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.

Scoring
Readiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.
Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.
Destroy the left or right generator=2000 points
Destroy the center generator=5000 points
Shield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than zero.</desc>

	<desc>Defender put players in charge of a ship sent to protect mankind from wave after wave of attacking alien forces.

Armed with "smart bombs", and the ability to use hyperspace to move quickly around the planet, the player ship must fight against Bombers, Pods, Swarmers, Baiters, and Landers - that can capture the humanoids and transform them into deadly and relentless Mutants. Fail to save the humanoids from freefall or Mutant transformation, and the planet is destroyed.

	<path>./Demolition Herby (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Wham! Bam! Watch out, ma'am!

You are Demolition Herby and you're out to own the roads. You must drive around a square section to black it out; the object being to black out all sections. There are only three things in your way: the chase cars. When they drive over a line you have turned red, it turns white again. To make matters worse, they will try to ram you off the track. The good news is if you ram them from behind, you run them off the track for a few seconds. If you need a burst of speed, shift into overdrive by pressing your button however, there is a drawback, as I will explain. Something else to keep an eye on is your fuel. You burn fuel as your drive and burn faster when you use overdrive. Each time you black out an section, you gain points and fuel. If you black out two sections at once, you gain more fuel. You will lose a life if you run out of fuel or are knocked off the track. If you lose three lives, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Demon Attack (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</desc>
	<path>./Demons to Diamonds (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Demons to Diamonds, you control a laser zapper which moves horizontally at either the top or the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting objects in the center of the screen. Wandering back and forth in the middle are demons which can be one of two colors. If you shoot a demon that is the same color as your zapper, it will turn into a diamond. Shooting the diamond before it disappears will earn you bonus points. If you shoot a demon of the opposite color, it will instead turn into a skull which will rapidly fire at your zapper. You begin the game with five zappers, and the game ends when all five have been destroyed by skulls. The game can be played by one or two players, and several game variations are included to set the level of difficulty.</desc>
	<path>./Desert Falcon (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Desert Falcon is an arcade style shooter. Many of the Pharaoh's great treasures are lost throughout the desert, and your goal is to steal as many as you can to earn points. The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</desc>
	<path>./Dice Puzzle (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>If you enjoy games like Rubik's Cube, then you'll like this one. The object of Dice Puzzle is to get all 16 dice to show the same number. You accomplish this by clicking on a column or row, which advances all of the numbers in that column or row by one (of course six advances to one). See how quickly (or in how many moves) you can do it.</desc>
	<path>./Dig Dug (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>
	<path>./Dodge 'Em (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You control a race car on a four lane track, and your goal is to collect all of the dots in order to earn points and advance to the next level! The race track is broken up into four quadrants; your racecar must remain in the lane it is in except where there is a break in the lanes between quadrants. Trying to stop you is a second car which travels in the opposite direction. This car will always be trying to get into the same lane as you, causing a crash, so you need to make sure you switch to any lane it isn't in! To help out, your racecar has the ability to travel at a fast or slow speed. You begin the game with three racecars, and the game ends when all three cars have crashed. A two player game variation is also available where one player controls a car trying to collect the dots, and the second player controls the crash car trying to stop the first player.</desc>
	<path>./Dolphin (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Dolphin is a side scrolling action game. You control a dolphin that is being chased by a giant sea squid. Your goal is to earn points by staying alive as long as possible. As you swim away from the squid, you will encounter schools of sea horses which form a vertical row on the screen with only a small opening to swim through. As you approach each school, the dolphins sonar will help you locate the opening; a low pitched sound will indicate the opening is near the bottom of the screen, and a higher pitched sound indicates the opening is near the top. If you miss the opening, the dolphin will lose speed allowing the squid to catch up to you! From time to time, a seagull may fly overhead; if you jump out of the water and touch the seagull, your dolphin will temporarily be able to chase the squid. Throughout the ocean are waves which are indicated by arrows; an arrow pointing the same direction you are travelling will boost the dolphins speed, whereas an arrow pointing the opposite direction slows you down. The longer you stay alive, the faster and trickier the squid will become! The game ends when all of your dolphins have been caught by the squid.</desc>

	<path>./Donkey Kong (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong Junior (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa!

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong. In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage. As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.

Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior. Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes. The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.

Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.

In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot. Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.

Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</desc>

	<desc>The king's treasures have been stolen! As the daring young prince, your goal is to recover them all. The treasures are being kept in various castles, each one guarded by a fire breathing dragon. Each level in the game has two parts; first you will need to cross the castle's drawbridge. You will have to jump and duck the dragons fireballs as well as avoid flying arrows to reach the other side! In the second part you need to collect all of the treasures on the screen and make it to the exit while avoiding the dragon who runs across the bottom of the screen. The dragons on each level have different patterns of movement and firing, and as the levels progress will become faster and trickier.</desc>
	<path>./Dragonstomper (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Long ago, a Druid magician created an amulet of great power that could subdue a dragon. Heading to the dragon's lair, the Druid accidentally dropped the amulet and it fell deep into its lair. Over time, the amulet imbued the dragon with cunning and power so that it began to spread treachery and evil about the peaceful Kingdom. The player's quest begins with the king summoning the player to defeat the dragon once and for all. Taking up the call to arms, the player begins by gathering their strength and fighting creatures in the enchanted countryside to build up enough power to become a Dragonstomper. When finally ready, the player moves on to an oppressed village near the dragon's lair in order to recruit soldiers, buy magical scrolls, and acquire medicines and elixirs needed to face the dragon in its lair. With all of his skills, training, equipment and soldiers, the Dragonstomper descends into the dragon's lair for a final combat to bring peace to the Kingdom.</desc>
	<path>./Dragster (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Dragster is a drag racing simulation for one or two players. The object of the game is to be the first car to race across the screen in the two player game, or to race across the screen in the shortest possible time in a one player game. The joystick acts as both the gas peddle and clutch; you have the ability to shift from first through fourth, but be careful not to shift too soon because you can't downshift! You must also be careful not to rev your engine too much, or you'll blow your engine and be out of the race. There are two game variations included; in the simpler game, you just need to drive straight to reach the goal. In the advanced variation, you also have the ability to steer and need to keep your car driving straight between the bleachers and road divider.</desc>

	<desc>Dumbo's Flying Circus was scheduled to be part of Atari's children's series (which included characters from Peanuts, Sesame Street, Disney, Muppets, and Garfield), but for one reason or another it never saw the light of day.  Atari advertised Dumbo in European Atari catalogs and even had a prototype box made, so the decision to shelve it must have been made quite late.  Even though Dumbo was developed as a children's game, the gameplay is quite difficult which may be the reason why it was never released.</desc>

	<desc>E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is a licensed adventure game, based on the movie. The adventure takes place on several screens with pits scattered about. The object of the game is to find pieces of E.T.'s phone. Once all pieces are found, E.T. calls home and the spaceship arrives to pick him up. E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces scattered around in order to regain energy which is constantly depleted with time. 

The phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving. 

Evil scientists and agents wander around the area, trying to capture E.T. and steal the parts he's carrying.</desc>

The Trillians are using attack bases to launch Kamikaze satellites and Trillian fighters at Earth.

When a satellite/fighter gets close, your weapon will automatically track their vertical motion. You must track them horizontally and fire at the right time.

You lose energy when a fighter shoots you or when a fighter or satellite explodes on Earth.

If you see a fighter with a white stripe (the back of the fighter), keep it on the screen for five seconds and you will come to an attack base. Destroy the attack base to regain energy.

If you lose all your energy, you will explode and the Trillians will celebrate as...The Earth Dies Screaming!</desc>

	<path>./Eli's Ladder (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>This game was designed to help teach children addition, subtraction and counting. Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.

The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.

The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.

There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.</desc>

	<desc>Ow! Your head hurts. Where are you? What happened? It is dark but you here a beeping and find a PDA at your feet. You note there is a dot on the PDA screen. When you take a step, it move, too.  Interesting. There is a button and stick. When you press the button, you see the walls of part of a maze. Moving the stick lets you look at more maze. All very well but you note that there is a timer counting down. You have a suspicion that when it ends, so will you.

You begin in a maze on the lower left corner. You can move anywhere but cannot pass through walls or the outer perimeter. If you press fire, you can see a spotlighted area of the maze and by holding down the button, you can move the joystick around to see more maze. You must find the exit before the timer, which begins counting down as soon as you move, reaches zero. In the maze, there is a box that will give you more time. If the timer reaches zero, game is over. Once you exit the maze, you get any remaining time as your score. If you never used the spotlight in that maze, your score is doubled.</desc>
	<path>./Encounter at L-5 (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Using an anti-matter launcher, you must defend the starbase L5 against a non-stop horde of blue Megalyte warrior ships and their death ships. As the warriors reach the bottom, they fire on your base. It does not hurt the base but would lose you one of your four lives. Sometimes the death ship takes a dive towards your base, firing as it goes. If it reaches your base, it will destroy your generator, losing you a life.

As hordes of Megalye ships descend, you can hold down the fire button. This will keep the anti-matter launcher in place and moving the paddle will shift the cursor and thus your aim. If you are in danger of being shot or need to destroy a death ship, just release the button and then you can move the launcher left or right.

There are 26 game variations. The odd numbered ones are one player, the even numbered are two player.

Scoring
You score ten points for each death ship you destroy
Your points vary for the warrior ships. The farther from you they are, the more the points.</desc>

	<desc>Enduro is an action racing game similar to Pole Position. Your goal is to last as long as you can in an enduro race; each day of the race you are required to pass a certain number of cars. If you succeed, you get to continue on, fail and you are out of the race. The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by; not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts of light, but the seasons can change as well. Snow, ice, and fog will occasionally appear to make driving more treacherous. With each day that passes, the other cars will become faster and more aggressive. At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.</desc>

	<path>./Entombed (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>What started out as a nice little archaeological expedition has suddenly become a nightmarish fight for survival! A team of archaeologists is trapped in an underground maze of dark, winding tunnels. All around them, fearsome zombies are emerging from the crypts. The archaeologists' only hope of survival (apart from some very fast running) is an ancient device known as the 'make-break', which can be used to either create or destroy pieces of wall.

In this increasingly frantic one or two-player arcade game, you'll need wits as well as dexterity. You'll have to think on the fly, plan strategically and race through the maze as fast as you can. Fail to keep up the pace and you're zombie fodder. Good luck!</desc>
	<path>./Escape from the Mindmaster (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You've been abducted! Kidnapped! Shanghaied! You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes.

You begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.

There are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:
Maze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.
Maze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow
Maze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence
Maze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once
Maze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five attempts.

You start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.

After you destroy ten towers, a tunnel will open so you can get underground. You will have three chances to get underground. If you choose to remain above ground, the firing rate of the enemies doubles.

Underground, the tunnel narrows after a time. If, after you hit ten towers underground, the firing speed doubles.

Points:
Hitting a tall above ground tower=50 points
Hitting a short above ground tower=20 points
Hitting an underground tower=50 to 360 points
Getting through tunnel safely without hitting a tower=20 points

After a certain amount of towers are hit, the ground turns from green to blue. When this happens, if you hit ten towers, you get an extra man. You can only have a maximum of eight extra men.</desc>

	<path>./Fantastic Voyage (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Fantastic Voyage is a vertically scrolling shooter for one player. The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.</desc>

	<path>./Final Approach (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are an air traffic controller at an international airport. You must guide planes in to landing safely.

Your first screen is the Approach Control Radar screen or ARC. You must guide the aircraft , using the cursor, until they are headed left to right along the yellow line headed towards the black stripe. Make sure the other planes are headed where they won't immediately head towards each other or off screen.

After the plane gets near the black stripe, move the cursor to the center red light and press the button. You will then be on the Ground Control Approach screen or GCA. Here you must center the plane's nose on the glide slope and localizer before it arrives at the end of the runway. If the landing is successful, the plane will disappear from the ARC screen and a new one will appear soon to take its place. If not, when you press your joystick button and return to the ARC screen, the plane will still be there. If a plane starts flashing on the ARC and you hear an emergency sound, this plane has an emergency and must be landed first.

Scoring
Successful landing=25 points
Successful emergency landing if landing before other planes=50 points
Aircraft wanders off radar=lose 5 points

You get a control error (lose a life) if you allow a near miss or do not immediately land an aircraft in distress. You are allowed an additional control error (extra life) every 500 points.

Your goal is to save the worker who is trapped in the warehouse; on the right side of the screen is a firetruck with an adjustable ladder. You can move the ladder to the appropriate floor of the building to climb up and rescue the trapped worker. Depending on which floors have caught fire, the worker will move to the lowest floor he can which isn't burning; you'll need to estimate which floor he'll be on when you position the ladder. Once the worker is safe, you move on to the next (more challenging) level. The fire in the building may spread quickly! If necessary, you can use a fire hose to put out the fire. Of course, you have a limited supply of water so make sure you don't run out!

	<desc>After your interplanetary craft accidentally enters a black hole, you find yourself in a different universe. This world is inhabited by strange, mechanical bug-like creatures. You find that this world contains both bad and good bugs; the good bugs have asked for your help, and you agree to defend them. Your first challenge is to rescue the Pixy; this is the last living creature on the planet and is guarded by a killer bee. Should you succeed, you next will need to fight off a variety of enemy creatures including a flaming pumpkin, demons, and coiled serpents. Each time you defeat the creatures on the screen, you can move to the right where a new challenge (and bonus) awaits! After you complete all of the screens of bad bugs, then the game repeats at a tougher difficulty level.</desc>
	<path>./Fireball (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Fireball is an arcade action game similar to Breakout. You are a juggler, and you need to keep multiple fireballs within the play field. You can hold on to two fireballs at a time, so be careful because if you try to catch a third it wall fall off the screen. Your goal is to destroy the bricks at the top of the screen by hitting them with the fireballs. When all the bricks are destroyed, you move on to the next round and are given one additional fireball to keep in play. Five different game variations are included:

Firetrap: Two additional fireballs are trapped within brick walls. Once a hole forms in the walls, you will also need to keep these additional fireballs in play.

Marching Blocks: In this game, each time you catch a fireball the rows of blocks will drop down one level. From time to time, a mystery fireball may also appear.

Knock-A-Block: This is the most basic game variation. There is a solid wall of blocks at the top of the screen that you need to destroy.

Migrating Blocks: In this game, the rows of blocks move! Every few seconds each row of blocks will rotate either to the left or to the right.

Cascade: There are five additional fireballs trapped within the block formation! When you destroy enough blocks to release an extra fireball, it too will need to be kept in play.</desc>

	<desc>In Fishing Derby, your goal is to be the first of two players to catch 99 pounds of fish. Each player is on a dock at the top of the screen, and you control the fishing line in the water. By moving the fishing line up or down, you can catch the fish that are swimming by. The deeper down you go, the bigger the fish are. When you catch a fish, you need to real it in! To make the game more difficult, a shark is constantly swimming back and forth. If you have a fish on your line and it touches the shark, the shark will eat it and you then will have to catch another fish. Two difficulty levels are available, and the game can be played by one person against the computer or two players against each other.</desc>
	<path>./Flag Capture (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Flag Capture is an action/strategy game for one or two players. Your goal is to locate a flag hidden somewhere on a 9x7 grid. Using the joystick you can move your explorer around the grid; on any square you can press the button to see if the flag is located in that square, or if not to receive a clue as to the flags location. If the square doesn't contain the flag, one of several items may appear: an arrow indicating what direction the flag is, a number indicating how many squares away the flag is, or a bomb which will cause you to have to start again. In the one player game your goal is to locate as many flags as possible in the 75 second time limit. There are several varieties of two players games: in free-for-all, both players can move around the grid simultaneously and whomever finds the flag first scores a point. In the other two player games, players take turns moving around the grid. Several skill levels are available which control the players moving speed, allow the flag to be stationary or move, or add an invisible wall around the playfield.</desc>

	<path>./Flash Gordon (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are Flash Gordon. Many spacemen have entered Spider City but never returned. Your job, Flash, is two fold. Rescue any spacemen you find in the tunnels of Spider City and destroy all the hatching pods.

The lower part of the screen is a map. You are the horizontal line, the hatching pods are the vertical lines and the Disrupters are the crosses. The upper part of the screen is the close-up of the action.

You rescue spacemen by touching them with your ship. You destroy hatching pods, and the spider warriors that hatch, by flying to the pods then shooting the warriors.

You can also shoot generators, patrol ships and debris. Shooting the generator will keep the Disrupter from moving about the city for a little bit but the debris never stops while you are within, so don't hang out in the Disrupter.

If you destroy five warriors at one hatching pod or your ship is destroyed when it returns, you will have a shield for a short time. There will be two beeps to warn you of the shield leaving.

The scoring is as follows:
10 points = Debris
25 points = Patrol Ship
70 points = Rescued Spaceman
100 points = Disrupter Generator

You get 100 points for killing the first warrior at a pod, 200 for the second, 300 for the third and so on.

You lose 1,000 points if you shoot a spaceman, but Flash Gordon would never do that, right?

Every time you conquer a city, you get an extra man.</desc>
	<path>./Football (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Football is a football game for two players. The game is played from a top down point of view of the field and features two skill levels and three game variations. Using the joystick you can choose from one of five different offensive or defensive plays. In the first game variation, after selecting a play you then control the players on the field. In the second game, you have the option of controller your players after a play is selected or allowing the computer to control the players. The third game has the computer controlling the players at all times and you only need to select the plays you wish it to execute  and indicate when you wish to punt or pass the ball. In all of the game variations the timer begins at 5 minutes, and is active only during plays. Of course, the team with the most points when the timer runs out wins!</desc>
	<path>./Forest (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>Ah, you poor woodcutter. You just want to cut some wood to sell so your family can eat but an evil witch has put a spell on the animals so they are attacking you. Well, no matter, one way or another you'll get your tree!

You must make your way two screens to the right to get to your tree. Animals will come at you from either side of the screen. You must either jump over the animal or press your button and push the joystick in the desired direction to chop them with your axe. Snakes cannot be chopped, only jumped over. 

Also to contend with is a bird in the air that is dropping stones. If you are hit by a stone, you will be unable to move for two seconds, which could prove fatal. Once you reach the tree, you must chop it down while still avoiding the animals. It takes four chops per side to fell the tree. If you need to, you can climb the tree to avoid animals. Once the tree is chopped, the game restarts at a faster level. You have only one life so if an animal touches you, it is game over.</desc>

	<path>./Frankenstein's Monster (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In the cold dark night you make your way through the ghoulish castle of Dr. Frankenstein. There you must prevent him from completing his creation.

Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.

You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.

You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points.

Game variations

	<desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

We apprehended Chicago Joe but in retaliation, his gang have holed up in an apartment building, taking hostage a dame and her kid. The following men have been positively identified:

Shifty
2. Scar Face
3. Mugsy
4. Lefty
5. Nitro Ed

Your orders are to snipe any gang member. DO NOT SHOOT AN INNOCENT! Watch out for Nitro Ed. He likes to play with hand grenades. One of those and you're pushing up daisies. Good luck.

You move the joystick to aim at a gangster and push the button to fire. Your ammo is limited so don't fire randomly. Occasionally, Nitro Ed, on the roof, will hold up a grenade. You must shoot him to disarm him. You get money for each gangster shot. The values for level one are:

1. Mugsy=$20
2. Scare Face=$30
3. Lefty=$40
4. Shifty=$50
5. Disarming Nitro Ed=$100

These amounts increase for each level by $10. You also get $10 for each bullet you have left after each level. There are six levels. The fourth level is a nighttime level. In this level, you must fire one bullet to light up the windows. If you do not fire for a couple seconds, they go dark again.
If you shoot an innocent, you will lose $1000 or you total amount if you have less than $1000.

If a gangster rises all the way out of a window, after a couple of seconds, he will shoot you and you will lose one bullet proof vest (life). After you lose all your vests, the game is over and Nitro Ed will laugh at you. If Nitro Ed gets off his hand grenade, no matter how many vests you have, the game is over. And Nitro Ed will laugh at you. You start with four vests and can earn another at $5000.</desc>

As you go along, you can accelerate or decelerate to avoid being bombed but be careful because you might ram some ships near the ground. You can jump to avoid them or blast them for points. You will also see numbers along your way. Run into them to acquire their point value. Do not shoot them or their value will be deducted from you score.

As this is Gas Hog, you will soon run low on fuel. You must get below ground via the occasional holes, to grab a refuel marker. Do not stay below ground, however, as you travel in the wrong direction while there. You start with four lives and lose one if you are hit by a bomb or ship or run out of fuel.</desc>

Since you're a likable old fellow, they have decided to induct you into their council of warriors. But first you must prove your worthiness by running the gauntlet.

You are given three glasses of water. You must run through the gauntlet to the ceremonial fires and use your water to put them out. You current glass of water will then be refilled then it is off to the next fire.

Of course, it is not that easy. You must jump over rocks and logs, duck under stones, arrows and tomahawks, and avoid hitting trees or touching the sides of the gauntlet.You can ease the thirst of the old men you come across for points but it will cost you water.

Scoring:
Jump over a rock or a log=50 points
Duck under an arrow, stone or tomahawk=100 points

The game begins in the graveyard outside the manor; here you play tag with a friendly rainbow ghost or skeleton which will supply you with spears you can fire at enemies. In the second screen, you approach the guarded entrance of the manor. Using the spears you collected, you need to shoot all of the enemies blocking the entrance. The third and fourth screens take place inside the manor; each floor has a set of stairs as well as several treasures and crosses which can be collected. There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>
	<path>./Ghostbusters (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

	<path>./Glib - Video Word Game (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600.

The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.

Difficulty switches
Use the left switch to set the number of players; B for one player, A for two.

Game variations
There are five games, each with five skill levels.
The skill levels differ by the amount of time you have to make words.
Skill levels for one player games:
Skill level 1=unlimited time (no clock)
Skill level 2=132 seconds
Skill level 3=39 seconds
Skill level 4=26 seconds
Skill level 5=random times
For two player games, the times are half of what they are in one player.

The games are:
Game 1 (Billboard): After each round, all the letters are reshuffled, so you get a whole new set of seven letters. Any letters that were not used go back into the mix.
Game 2 (Skill Builder): Only the letters you used to make the word are replaced. Any unused letters stay on the top spaces.
Game 3 (Times Up): You are given seven letters only. You must use these seven to make as many words as you can.
Game 4 (Encore): The letters on the top row all shift to the right, with the last letter disappearing and a new letter plopping into the first spot. You must grab you letters and place them quickly. Any letters the you don't use will reappear randomly again.
Game 5 (Over the Edge): Same as game 4 but letters that disappear never return.</desc>

The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.</desc>

	<path>./Gorf (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Gorf is a game similar to Space Invaders, alien vessels approach closer and closer in their threatening row formation.

The game itself consists of four levels:

1. The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship &amp; shield on one side and the aliens on the other side;

The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;

The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading "towards" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;

The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.

Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.</desc>

Of course, there will be obstacles on the tracks which will slow you down if you're not careful. Numerous other cars will often get in your way, oil slicks will cause you to temporarily lose control, and on the more difficulty tracks narrow bridges will cause you to come to a complete stop if you miss the path.</desc>
	<path>./Gravitar (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.</desc>
	<path>./Gremlins (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>This game is based on the Steven Spielberg movie of the same name but is different than the other versions.

In this version, on the first screen, Mogwai are jumping from the roof to get at hamburgers on the ground. You, as Billy, must catch them before the hit the ground. If you get them all, it is off to the next, faster, level. If you miss eight, then you go to a shooting screen.

On the shooting screen, gremlins are approaching from the distance. You must shoot them before they reach you. If one reaches you, you lose a life. After they are all dead, it is back to the first screen at a faster level. In later levels, puddles of water will divide the gremlins in two.</desc>

	<path>./Guardian (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Guardian is an arcade action game for one or two players. In an intergalactic war, an enemy ship called Dromeda is attacking your home planets and you need to defend them! The planets are located at either the top or the bottom of the screen, and are defended by a shield. Dromeda is in the middle of the screen, and will be launching explosive devices at the planets. You control a spaceship which is the last hope to save the planets. Unfortunately, your ships lasers are unable to reach Dromeda, so you you must shoot the explosives as they come in. If you miss any explosives, they will destroy part of the shield. If a large enough hole forms, an explosive could get through and destroy an entire planet. The game ends when all of your planets have been destroyed.</desc>
	<path>./Gunfight (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>This game is inspired by the 1975 Midway coin-op game, Gun Fight.

There are four game versions:
In Standard Duel, the first player to score seven hits on their opponent, wins.
In Six-shooter Duel, the first player to score seven hits on their opponent, wins however, after six shots, you must grab the flashing spot on your side of the screen to reload.
In Escape Scenario, the player on the right is trying to escape and must last ninety-nine time units. The player on the left just needs to shoot the player on the right one time to win. The player on the right CAN shoot the player on the left and this will buy him a little time.
In Target Scenario, there will be a target in the middle of the screen. Each hit of the target is one point. Each hit of the opposing player is five points. The first player to seventy-seven points, wins.</desc>
	<path>./Gyruss (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The entire solar system is being attacked by the vicious Gyrusians, and it's up to you to save the day! You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</desc>
	<path>./H.E.R.O. (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>
	<path>./Halloween (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Protect the children and fight for your life "the night HE came home!"

Babysitting a group of children in a large two-story house, players assume the role of Laurie Strode as psychopath Michael Myers has escaped from the mental institution and has come back for revenge. Players must guide the children to safe rooms while avoiding Michael Myers and his knife.

The house is large and full of dangerous blackouts and dead-ends within its sixteen rooms. However, Laurie is not completely defenseless. There is a knife that can be found to protect herself once the familiar theme music begins to play and killer remains in pursuit. 

Players will advance to the next level by either stabbing Michael Myers twice, or rescuing five of the children.</desc>
	<path>./Halo 2600 (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Hangman (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Hangman is an electronic version of the game hangman! Your goal is to figure out a word that the computer has generated by guessing one letter at a time. Guess a correct letter, and it will appear on the screen in the proper location, but if you guess a letter that isn't in the word then you are one step closer to being hung. Guess eleven incorrect letters, and the game is over. A point is earned each time a word is completed. Several difficulty settings are included which affect the number of letters in the words. The game can be played by one or two players, and in the two player version the words can optionally be created by one of the players instead of the computer.</desc>
	<path>./Harem (USA).a26</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Haunted House (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the  four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.

The mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!

You are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn, you will need to put down the scepter so be careful! You win the game when all three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the better the score!</desc>
	<path>./Holey Moley (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc>It's video Whack-A-Mole!

Each round consists of twenty-five moles. When a mole pops out of his hole, press the corresponding button on the Kid's Controller to whack it. The faster you hit him, the more points you'll get. If the King Mole pops up, whack him for even higher points. Beware of the acorn. If it pops up, don't whack it as it will cost you points. You must score at least three hundred points by the time the mole count reaches zero. If you reach or exceed three hundred points in one round, any points beyond three hundred will be added to your score as a bonus. If you fail to score three hundred points in one round, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Home Run (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base. 

The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</desc>
	<path>./Human Cannonball (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land in a bucket of water. To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.</desc>
	<path>./Hunchy II (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>A 4k game (three more than its predecessor!), Hunchy 2 boasts more bells and whistles (admittedly more bells than whistles) than the game it is nominally a successor to, the Atari 2600's Hunchy, and though superficially drawing thematic inspiration from Hunchback II: Quasimodo's Revenge, its basic gameplay has been more directly derived from Chuckie Egg and Miner 2049er.

The gameplay in question involves a progression through 14 levels 
of platforming to impress Esmeralda, climbing up and down ladders to gather bells while avoiding guards and a regular stream of missiles being fired in from the sides.
</desc>
	<path>./Hunt &amp; Score (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Hunt &amp; Score is similar to the game Memory. The player is presented with a numbered grid; behind each grid section is a picture. On each turn, the player chooses two grid sections in an attempt to find two matching pictures. Points are earned for finding matching pictures, and the player with the most points at the end wins. Several game options include a 16 or 30 square game grid, the ability to handicap one of the players, and the ability to enable or disable wild cards.</desc>
	<path>./I Project (Europe) (Unl).a26</path>

	<path>./Ice Hockey (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Ice Hockey is an ice hockey game for one player against the computer or two players. Each team consists of two players, one offensive and one defensive. At any given time one player is active and can be controlled while the other remains inactive; if the puck is near your goal then the defensive player becomes active, otherwise you control the offensive player. Each player has the ability to shoot the puck at a variety of angles, and can even body check their opponent! The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player more of an advantage.</desc>
	<path>./Ikari Warriors (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Ikari Warriors is a vertically scrolling action game. One or two players fight their way through a variety of terrain, such as jungles, rivers, and ruins.

	<desc>Indy 500 is a racing game played from a top down point of view. In the one player game, your goal is to complete as many laps as you can in 60 seconds. In the two player game, the first player to complete 25 laps wins! Included are several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and additional game variations called ice race, tag, and crash 'n score. In ice race, the track is icy causing your car to slide often and making it difficulty to steer.  In tag, one player is "it" and needs to tag the other player. For each second you race without being tagged, a point is earned. Lastly, in crash 'n score the goal is to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the track.</desc>
	<path>./Infiltrate (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are a secret agent sent on an important mission to recover enemy documents. There are enemy assassins trying to stop you.

You move the joystick to move your character, left or right. Press the button to fire. You fire in the direction you are moving. When you are next to an elevator, you will automatically board it when it gets to your level unless your are pushing towards it, in which case you will walk across it. 

If you are on the same level with an assassin and there is no elevator between you, you can shoot him. If he shoots at you, you can pull down on the joystick to duck. You cannot shoot while ducked. If the assassin shoots or touches you, you lose a life.

Difficulty switch
A=Enemy shots travel the length of the screen
B=Enemy shots only travel half the screen's length

Scoring
Agent travels all floor levels, top to bottom or bottom to top=3,000 points
Shooting an assassin=250 points
Assassin is riding elevator when shot=75 bonus points added to assassin shooting points

You get an extra agent every 10,000 points.

	<desc>In James Bond 007 you control James Bond in his multi purpose craft. This craft can travel on both land and sea, can jump over danger, or fire at enemies on the many different levels. Each horizontally scrolling level in the game is loosely based on a different James Bond movie. The levels included are Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only. Each level has a variety of enemies trying to destroy you, and a unique goal that must be accomplished to continue on (for example, you may have to land on a hidden oil rig to stop Seraffino, or find Stromberg's undersea laboratory and destroy it). If you can complete all the missions, you win the game! Good luck, Mr. Bond.</desc>
	<path>./Jammed (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>You want to steal your dream car. But first you must get those other clunkers out of the way.

This is a shifting-pieces puzzle where you are trying to move the white rectangles out of the way so the yellow car has a clear path to the exit. Place the circle cursor onto the end of a white or yellow car and if it changes from a pink circle with a minus sign to a blue circle with an arrow, you can press the button to move the car. Try to free the yellow car in the fewest moves.</desc>
	<path>./Jawbreaker (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>A clone of Pac-Man, where you as jaws must collect all points and escape lethal heads. There are also magical points to break heads by your jaws during some time. You have to collect the points, magical items, and progress from level to level.</desc>
	<path>./Journey Escape (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You're on the road with the rock band Journey! After each concert, your goal is to guide the five band members to the escape vehicle so they can get to the next concert on time. You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</desc>
	<path>./Joust (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>
	<path>./JoustPong (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>This is a variation on the classic game Pong that adds flapping wings to your paddles. You must press your flap button repeatedly to go up and stop pressing to come down.

In the Atari 2600 version, there is also a pterodactyl on the screen the interferes with the ball or your paddle. The Atari 2600 version also includes a variation referred to as 'Poorlords' that adds a wall of bricks behind the players that must be busted through to score points.</desc>
	<path>./Jr. Pac-Man (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Jr. Pac-Man features gameplay similar to the original Pac-Man, but with a few changes. As Jr., you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.</desc>
	<path>./Jungle Fever (USA).a26</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Jungle Hunt (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty once all four have been survived.  If you don't survive these adventures, you will not only lose your own life but that of the lovely Penelope, who has been captured by cannibals!

The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines without plummeting to your doom? The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river. Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with. Don't forget to go up for air! In the third part, you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics. Once you've cleared all these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked spear. Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?

Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile phase). The view is always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.</desc>

	<desc>Kabobber was originally a prototype game that was programmed by Rex Bradford, known for his work on Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Jedi Arena. It was discovered in 2000 and improved upon a little before being released to the public in ROM format. Kabobbers are strange (but cute) little creatures who just love wreaking havoc. Your objective is to send in your Buvskies to krush the Kabobbers before they krush you. You can have up to nine Buvskies onscreen at one time, but you have reserves waiting offscreen should one get krushed. You move your Bruvskies across the grid, jumping on enemy Kabobbers in order to defeat them and earn additional reserve Bruvskies. The baby Bruvskies become big ones when they defeat an enemy. The enemies get tougher and tougher, meaning very good timing is required in the later stages. Above all, you must reach Princess Buvsky before she reaches the rainbow energy at the other end of the level and devours it. A very unique game, but also somewhat fun.</desc>
	<path>./Kaboom! (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The mad bomber is on the loose! As he races back and forth at the top  of the screen, you need to catch the bombs he drops in buckets of water. One point is earned for each bomb caught, but miss one of the bombs, and Kaboom! As the levels progress, the mad bomber will move faster and faster and drop more and more bombs. You start the game with three buckets, and lose one each time a bomb is missed. The game ends when all of your water buckets are gone.</desc>

	<desc>Baby Roo has been kidnapped by monkeys, and it's up to Mama Roo to come to the rescue! Your kangaroo starts out at the bottom of the screen. You need to guide the kangaroo up the various ladders and platforms to the top where Baby Roo is being held captive. The monkeys will be trying to stop you by throwing or dropping apples and knocking you off the platforms. Your kangaroo has boxing gloves, however, and can knock out the monkeys with a single punch! Along the way various types of fruit can be collected to earn bonus points.</desc>
	<path>./Karate (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Karate is a fighting game for two players or one player against the computer. Your goal is to earn a black belt by winning a series of fights. By moving the joystick in various directions and pushing the button, you can use a variety of kicks and punches which are each worth varying amounts of points if successful. Each fight lasts for two minutes, and at the end of that time the points earned will be added up to determine who the winner is. There are two difficulty levels available.</desc>
	<path>./Keystone Kapers (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</desc>
	<path>./Killer Satellites (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>For decades, the weapons satellites have orbited Earth harmlessly. Now, for unknown reasons, they have dropped from the sky to obliterate mankind. You are a test pilot with an experimental craft that can stop the satellites. It is up to you to protect your home town.

You fly above your town's forcefield. Satellites will drop from the sky and show on the radar area at the screen top. You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the ability to penetrate the town's shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town's shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram into one.</desc>
	<path>./King Kong (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>King Kong has taken a lady to the top of the Empire State Building. It is up to you to rescue her but it won't be easy. Kong is throwing bombs at you.

This game is a clone of Donkey Kong, except instead of barrels, you must avoid bombs. You must make your way across the floors and up the ladders while jumping over bombs for points and holes in the floor. There is also a timer in the upper right. It starts at nine-hundred ninety and counts down ten points per second. If you are hit by a bomb or fall through a hole in the floor or the time reaches zero, you lose a life. Occasionally, Kong will release a magic bomb that gives more points when you jump it as well as moves you to the next floor up. Once you reach the top floor, the game starts again but faster.</desc>

Kool-Aid man must gather up Kool-Aid soft drink mix in order to catch and put a stop to the Thirsties' scheme. The three ingredients are Water (W), Sugar (S), and Kool-Aid (K). If the Thirsties touch Kool-Aid Man, he gets bounced around the yard, losing time, and the pool gets drained further. 

If the Thirsties succeed in draining the pool, it's "Game Over" for Kool-Aid Man. If Kool-Aid Man succeeds, then he wins and goes on to the next level of difficulty. Oh Yeah!</desc>
	<path>./Krull (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Krull is a multi part action game based on the movie of the same name. A beast and his army have traveled through space until finally landing on the distant planet of Krull and ravaging the entire planet. But there is a prophecy which tells of a king and queen who will someday take back the planet. These future rulers are Princess Lyssa and Prince Colwyn. But before their marrage, Princess Lyssa is captured by the beast! 

You play the part of Prince Colwyn on a mission to rescue Lyssa and destroy the beast. The game is divided up into several parts.

The first part takes place during the foiled wedding. A large number of slayers arrive at the castle, and you need to defeat as many as you can to earn points. But eventually Princess Lyssa is captured.

In the next section you need to ride your horse towards the Widow's web; on the way you can collect Glaives which may be used to fight the beast. Once you reach the web, you need to make your way to the cocoon at the top of the web in order to find the correct path to the Black Fortress. The crystal spider along with strands of the web make maneuvering your way around this screen a challenge. Once you know the correct path, you ride on to the Black Fortress. 

Here you need to use the Glaives you've collected to free the Princess from a prison, and then destroy the beast! After successfully completing all tasks, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>
	<path>./Kung-Fu Master (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>A conversion of the arcade game of the same name, which itself is loosely based on a movie, Kung-Fu Master is a side scrolling action game for one or two players, who alternate turns.

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.</desc>
	<path>./Lady Bug (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>An action game in the same style as Pac-Man but very very different. Players control a ladybug who must venture around different mazes collecting all of the food pellet "x"'s. In addition to there being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game.  In the center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned every time the border around the screen makes a complete "lap". Timers for the border vary upon the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.

In addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses. However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to that colour's word. The red word is "SPECIAL" and the yellow word is "EXTRA". Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus round.

Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the X's being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player dies, but letter powerups are not.</desc>

	<desc>In Laser Blast, you control an intergalactic spacecraft, and you need to destroy enemy ground forces. Using your laser blasts, try to destroy the enemy vehicles which appear three at a time. But be careful, they are fully armed with their own lasers and have no intention of letting you take them out easily! The more enemy vehicles you destroy, the more points you earn. If you do get hit by a laser blast, your spacecraft will fall to the ground and crash. When hit you still have one last chance to take out an enemy by maneuvering the spacecraft to crash land on top of it.</desc>
	<path>./Laser Gates (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Laser Gates is a side scrolling shooter. Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the force fields.</desc>

As you collect diamonds you need to bring them back to the shark cage in order to earn points. Swimming back and forth constantly is a deadly shark. If the shark encounters any of the diamonds, it will eat them; likewise you can also be eaten by the shark, causing you to lose a life. You have no defense against the shark, however you are immune if you are in the shark cage and the doors are closed. Somewhere in the maze the Loch Ness monster remains hidden. If you disturb the monster, it will continuously chase you unless you can lead it back into one of the caves located in the corners of the screen.</desc>

	<desc>Lock 'n' Chase is an arcade action game similar to Pac-Man. You play a thief who is trapped in a maze like vault. To get out, you need to collect all of the gold dots located in the maze. Your task won't be easy, since there are four police officers in the vault who are constantly trying to catch you! Located throughout the maze are numerous doors. As you run through the maze, you have the ability to temporarily close a door in an attempt to block the police. You can only close two doors at a time, and any closed doors automatically open again after a short amount of time. When all of the gold in the maze has been collected, the exit to the vault will open and you can escape and move on to the next, more difficult vault. Occasionally a bonus item will appear in the maze, such as a cash bag, crown, or briefcase, which can be collected to earn even more points.</desc>
	<path>./London Blitz (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>During WWII German bombers turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Most bombs exploded on impact but some would sit for hours, days or weeks before detonating. It was up to the Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXB's) before they exploded. As a Lance Corporal in the Royal Engineers, it is your job to defuse these bombs.

First, you will check your London map to see where the bombs are. Then it is defusing time. 

On the C64, you must use the joystick to cause the dial to rotate, changing the numbers next to a switch then clicking on the disarm switch at the bottom. If the number is wrong, you must change it again and keep trying. 

On the Atari 2600, you slide a sliding bar. On green bombs, the top bar controls the left switch, the middle the middle and the bottom the right.You set the slide to a spot the move to the switches and push right. On orange bombs, what slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb and on blue bombs, you can't control the switches. They just randomly change and you push right and hope you disarm in time.

The possible ranks are:
Lance Corporal
Corporal
Sargent
Staff Sargent
Warrant Officer
Second Lieutenant
First Lieutenant
Captain

At the start of the game, you can select which rank to start at, from Lance Corporal to Second Lieutenant on the C64 or from Lance Corporal to First Lieutenant on the Atari 2600.

Every time you disarm a bomb, you move up levels within your rank. Move up eight levels and you are promoted. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage, you are demoted a level in rank.

You lose the game is you are demoted below Lance Corporal or a bomb explodes while you are near it, a not-very-healthy thing to happen.

You win if you get promoted to Captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.</desc>

You control a photon cannon at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to protect six energy stations located to your left and right. Waves of rockets and other ships will fly by on the screen, and occasionally one will drop in an attempt to destroy one of the stations (as a warning on most levels, the enemy will turn white just before it drops). You need to make sure you shoot it before your energy station is destroyed! When all six energy stations are gone, the game is over. A two player variation is also included; one player will control the photon cannon, and the second player controls a cursor and can select when and where an enemy will drop. The players alternate between offense and defense in this version.</desc>

	<desc>M*A*S*H was one of the many attempts by various software companies to take a successful movie or television show and convert it into a playable game.

In this game, you play the role of "Hawkeye Pierce," a surgeon stationed at the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital #4077 during the Korean War (1950-1953). There are two main stages in the game, each of which you must pass to move to the next round. The first mission involves rescuing injured soldiers from the battlefield with your helicopter and returning them to home base without being shot down by enemy tanks. The second mission takes place in the operating room while you are required to carefully remove bullets and shrapnel from wounded soldiers... it is very similar to the classic "OPERATION" tweezers game by Milton Bradley.

Each set of missions are repeated four times. The first player to reach 999 points wins the game. There are four different variations of games, each selectable as either one player (against the computer) or two-player mode.</desc>

	<desc>You are Commander Harrington "Harry" Crag of the starship "Endless Search". You are put into a Malagai base for repairs but now the Malagai are holding you ransom. They want your advanced technology.

There are three airlock doors per starbase. You must get the correct key for each door. Each is held by one of three Malagai. The order of which Malagai is holding which key is shown by the pictures above the starbase.

If you are away from your assigned compartment for too long, as indicated by the line at the bottom of the screen, the Malagai will attack and you will need to return to your compartment to make them friendly again. When you touch a Malagai and, if it is the correct one, get the airlock door key, the Malagai will attack and the airlock will flash, on most game variations (see below). You must then make your way to the airlock. One door will disappear and the Malagai will become friendly again. After you open the third door, it is off to the next starbase.

After the third (blue) starbase, you get an extra man.

Game Variations:
Version 1: All the Malagai have different shapes and colors
Version 2: All the Malagai have the same shape but different colors
Version 3: All Malagai are the same shape and color and the airlocks do not blink to show you got the right key.

Scoring:
Touch a Malagai while they're friendly=100 points (50 point bonus if it has the correct key)
Open airlocks one or two=100 points
Open airlock three to exit starbase orange or teal=150 points
Open airlock three to exit blue starbase=250 points

	<desc>Mama Mia! That's a  lots a pasta!

Mama brings pasta to the table. You must either eat the pasta, toss it to Frankie the cat when he is at the window, or toss it to Sergio the dog when he is under the table.

You have four lives. If you eat more than 20 plates of pasta, you will burst (literally) and lose 1 life. If more than 9 plates of pasta are placed on the table, it will collapse and you will lose 1 life.

To eat pasta, you move the joystick to the right then the left. To toss pasta to a pet, you move the joystick to the right then up or down in one smooth motion. You must throw when Mama's back is turned and the cat is in the window or the dog is in the right spot under the table. If you throw food at the floor or window when the pet is not in position or if Mama sees you throw food to a pet, she will bring 3 plates the next time. Remember, over nine plates on the table and it is arrivederci una vita (goodbye one life).

To clear a level, you must eat or toss a certain number of plates of pasta.
1=31
2=32
3=35
4=37
5=40
6=42
7=45
8=47
9=49

The point value of each plate of pasta starts at 5 at level 1 and increases by 1 point per level, to a maximum of 13 at level 9.
You get an extra life at every 1,000 points. The highest points you can reach is 9,999.</desc>

Avoid the monsters by jumping over them or grab an old miner possession to become energized and grab a mutant for points. Use the lift to reach the higher parts of the screen.

The next area is the Crusher, with the same goal as Lift but more challenging as the player must also avoid getting crushed. The last part is the Radioactive Waste, where the goal is again the same, but the player must maneuver Bob around the radioactive waste. In each screen, there is a timer in the upper right. If this timer reached zero before you claim all sections, you lose a life.

After you have beaten all three screens, they repeat but without any of the bonuses for energizing, so you must jump over or avoid all mutants.</desc>
	<path>./Mines of Minos (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are the last mining robot on the Minos mine. Monsters have destroyed all your comrades.

As the last robot, you must traverse the mine's various levels, gathering spare parts to make more robots (extra lives). You must either avoid the monsters or blow them up with a bomb. After a few seconds, if the monster hasn't hit the bomb, it will explode harmlessly. You can only drop one bomb at a time. If a monster is killed, it will regenerate somewhere in the maze.

To deposit your spare parts, you must get to the center top or bottom of any level. To move to another level, hold your joystick button down while moving through the tunnels on either side. You can also use these tunnels, without holding down the button, to quickly get from left or right side of the maze to avoid monsters.

To win the game, get to level five and ram each of the three stationary monsters to kill them. You will need at least two spare robots as the ramming will destroy you and the monster.

In two player games, player one is the robot, player two is a monster. If the robot runs into the monster being controlled, the monster is destroyed instead of the robot. However, by pushing the joystick button, player two can switch to another monster, allowing the robot to run into an uncontrolled (and therefore deadly) monster.

Difficulty switches
Left switch for the robot, right for the monsters.
Set to A to make half speed, B for normal speed.

	<path>./Miniature Golf (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>This is a computer game simulation of a Miniature Golf course. It attempts to refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance.  As in a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the "cup."  Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated.

Rather than a full 18 holes, this Miniature Golf variation has a nine-hole half-course. Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the cup. The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes. While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it. So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole.

Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.</desc>
	<path>./Missile Command (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Aliens from the planet of Krytol are attacking your cities!! As the commander of a missile base, it is your responsibility to defend them. A variety of enemy weapons and planes will be incoming trying to destroy the six cities at the bottom of the screen. You need to fire missiles to destroy the incoming weapons. If anything gets through, one of your cities could be destroyed. When all of the cities are gone, the game is over. On each level you have a limited amount of ammo, so make sure most (if not all) of your shots are accurate or you could run out of ammo and leave your cities at risk! As the levels progress, there are more and more enemy weapons to destroy which come in at an increasingly faster rate.</desc>
	<path>./Missile Control (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>Missile Control is a Missile Command-style game. The player has to defend their cities from incoming bombs fire by alien spaceships.

The player controls a cursor on the screen which indicates the direction of fire for the defense missiles. Once launched, they travel in a straight line from the launcher through the point the player specified until they hit an object. Each level is won by destroying all alien spaceships. The player loses once all their cities are destroyed. Bonus cities can be obtained by destroying a sufficient number of alien spacecraft.

The game gets progressively harder, for example bombs will fall faster and energy barriers might protect the aliens from the player's attacks. To get around the barriers, players can deflect their shots from large defense missiles launched at the sides of the screen.</desc>
	<path>./Mission 3,000 A.D. (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>Mission 3000 is an arcade action game where you control the space ship Thunderhawk on a mission to destroy enemy starbases. On each level, there are six heavily guarded starbases which you need to locate and destroy. To help out, at the bottom of the screen is a scanner which shows the location of the Thunderhawk as well as the starbases. In the main view, the Thunderhawk is visible at the center of the screen which will scroll to follow your movement. To destroy the starbases and numerous attacking starfighters, the Thunderhawk is equipped with lasers which can be fired in eight different directions. When all six starbases have been destroyed, you are awarded an extra life before moving on to the next, more difficult level. The game ends when all of your lives have been lost.</desc>

	<desc>Mogul Maniac is a 1st-person perspective (although you can see your ski's) skiing game where the objective is to get through the open and and closed gates as quickly as possible. 

The gates consists of 2 poles of the same color: either red or blue of which the objective is to ski between those poles.

The game consists of 9 different courses as well as 2 different difficulty settings (novice and expert). In the novice setting you will be penalized 5 seconds for each gate you miss, the expert setting however automatically disqualifies you if you miss a gate (although you still can complete the run).

There also is no limit to the number of players that can play, but only the fastest time will be shown on the screen.</desc>

	<path>./Montezuma's Revenge - Featuring Panama Joe (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You play as a treasure hunter named Panama Joe, whose goal is to find an ancient treasure hidden by Aztec warrior  deep inside catacombs. But beware, the catacombs are a large maze inhabited by monsters. Bouncing and rolling skulls, dancing spiders, disappearing and re-appearing chains and tons of fire await you. You'll have to find many keys and unlock doors in order to reach your goal. Panama Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat. That's why the monsters in the game should be avoided: a collision with an enemy leads to a premature death.</desc>
	<path>./Moon Patrol (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The moon is under attack from a horde of aliens, and you must stop them in your armed buggy. Drive along the surface shooting the aliens and avoiding their bullets. The surface is not flat, there are craters and rocks to avoid contact with, and landmines on the surface. Flying saucers create new craters when they crash. The 25 restart points are letter-coded.</desc>
	<path>./Moonsweeper (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>
	<path>./Motocross (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>Motocross is a motorcycle racing game viewed from a top-down perspective. The player rides a bike against an endless number of opponents on a straight road, trying to avoid running into them. In addition, the player has to watch the amount of gas left in the tank. The fuel gauge can be restored by driving over fuel cans. The goal of the game is to overtake a specified amount of bikes. Once this is accomplished, a new "scene" starts, and the difficulty is increased.</desc>
	<path>./Motocross Racer (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Motocross Racer is a bike racing game where you need to race through three different scenes in the shortest amount of time possible. Each scene takes place in a different location with a different perspective. First you will race through the desert with a 3-D behind the bike point of view. Rocks, cacti, scorpions, and other obstacles should be avoided or you'll crash and lose valuable time. Next you'll race a winding path uphill through the woods. This section has a top down view, and you'll lose time if you wander off the track or crash into obstacles. The final segment of the race takes place on the beach with a side scrolling point of view. Various obstacles and other racers will all get in your way here! If you crash too many times, or take too long the game will be over.</desc>
	<path>./MotoRodeo (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>This is a monster truck race that features true split screen action on an Atari 2600.

First, you move the joystick(s) up or down to select if this opponent will be a human player or computer, a blazer or a truck and whether it will have tires or trax. Tires allow you to go over obstacles easier, trax make you bounce higher. Then on the next screen, you select weather you are going to do a competition at hard, medium or easy or whether you are going to practice one of the obstacles in the game.

Press the joystick button to accelerate. Move the joystick down to do a wheelie when on the ground. Move the joystick left and right when in the air to control your spin. Move the joystick left and right quickly to escape mud bogs. Press the joystick button and push forward to use a nitro burst if you collected them.

Difficulty switches
Only the left switch is used.
Set it to A for a scoring game in which the player with the most points at the end of the race wins.

	<path>./Mountain King (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Deep within a multi platformed diamond mine is a valuable crown. Your goal is to locate and retrieve the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!</desc>
	<path>./Mouse Trap (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Mouse Trap is an arcade action game similar to Pac-Man. You control a mouse in a maze; your goal is to eat all of the bits of cheese in order to score points and move on to the next maze. Wandering throughout the maze are several cats who are trying to catch you! Your mouse has the ability to temporarily turn into a dog and be able to chase the cats. To do so, however, he will need to eat the dog bones which are located throughout the maze. The maze also contains numerous doors. The mouse can move these doors to reconfigure the maze in an attempt to outsmart the cats.</desc>
	<path>./Mr. Do! (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You control Mr. Do has he tries to harvest all of the cherries on the screen. However, there are numerous bad guys out to get him! Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

The mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.</desc>
	<path>./Mr. Do!'s Castle (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Mr. Do!'s Castle is an action platform game which has you in a castle consisting of several floors, each of which contain a variety of blocks. You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles. 

There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. 

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.</desc>

	<path>./Ms. Pac-Man (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

You control a diver at the bottom of the screen, and there is a giant octopus and killer shark you need to deal with. Each time an octopus tentacle touches the bottom of the screen, or the shark catches you some of your treasure will be lost. To deal with these creatures, your diver has a harpoon. You need to make sure that you shoot the shark before it can make it's way to the bottom of the screen and catch you (the shark will appear again at the top of the screen each time it is shot.) The octopus' tentacles will be reaching downward; each time a tentacle is shot it will retreat back to the top so you need to keep shooting the tentacles before one can reach the bottom. Of course, your diver has a limited air supply. Your companion is in a boat on the surface, and will occasionally drop an air line down. You need to catch this to replenish your air before it runs out (if you run out of air, some treasure will be lost). The game ends when you have lost all of your treasure.</desc>

	<desc>A classic Asterix &amp; Obelix game where you simultaneously play as (both) Asterix and Obelix maintaining their favorite Gaulish sport of thumping the living daylights out of Roman soldiers.

The objective of the game is to help Asterix "stun" Roman soldiers (simply by running into them, and they turn white from blue) while you command good ol'Obelix to throws his oversized Menhirs down at stunned Romans with a splat.

If by any chance a stunned soldier is not whacked by a flying menhir, they turn "red" and hostile, which means Asterix is in trouble. In any case, he needs some good ol' magic potion from Getafix in order to defeat the "red" Romans, so be ready to catch some when Getafix comes knocking.

There are 2 types of Roman soldiers to thump: the fat legionnaires and the small centurions. Centurions are worth more points.</desc>

	<desc>Off The Wall is an arcade action game with Breakout style gameplay. You control Kung Fu Lu, whose mission is to destroy a mysterious, evil wall by reflecting a bouncing ball into the bricks that make up the wall. When the bricks are hit by the ball, they are destroyed. On the top of the screen is a mystical dragon which guards the wall. Each level can be completed by either destroying all of the bricks in the wall, or hitting the dragon six times with the ball. Once the first level is completed, a blackbird will also appear on screen just below the wall. The blackbird will deflect the ball, and tries to get in the way to make your mission more difficult. From time to time, a magic token will fall downward which gives you special powers if caught. These can make the ball magnetic and follow your player, give you a larger paddle, or make the ball explosive and take out larger chunks of bricks. You start the game at a skill level of Peasant, and advance in rank every time four waves of bricks are cleared. You lose a life every time the ball falls off the bottoms of the screen, and the game ends when you lose all five of your lives.</desc>

	<path>./Oink! (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Oink! is based on the fairy tale of the three little pigs. The big bad wolf is trying to blow down each of the pigs houses. You control each pig one at a time. The wolf is at the bottom of the screen and will blow a hole in the house one section at a time. Each time a hole is formed, the pig must patch it up quickly so the wolf can't get in. New materials are located at the top of the screen, and you need to grab them and place them in the holes as they are formed. The longer you last, the tougher the wolf will become! You start the game controlling the pig whose house is made of straw; when he is caught, you move on to the pig in the house made of sticks. Finally you will control the pig in the house made of bricks. When all three pigs have been caught by the wolf, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Okie Dokie (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>Okie Dokie is a puzzle game where you are to clear the screen of all the items. You do this by clicking the item to 'flip' it to off. But things are not as easy as that. When you flip an item, the spaces above, below, to the left and to the right of it are reversed. If the items in those spaces were on, they turn off but if the items in those spaces were off, they turn back on. Try to clear the screen in the fewest moves.</desc>
	<path>./Omega Race (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game.  You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you.  Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too.  The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</desc>
	<path>./Open Sesame (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>Open, Sesame! is an action platform game. You control Ali Baba, and your goal is to reach the cave of treasures. The treasury entrance is at the top of the screen, and you begin each level at the bottom and need to climb your way up. To do so, you will need to find a good location where you can throw a rope up to the next platform and climb up (there will be a dot on the platform where you can safely throw a rope, two on each floor). Before the treasury can be entered, you need to attach ropes to each of the possible locations. To hinder your progress, there are guards wandering each of the floors. If you're caught, you'll lose a life! To help out, a magic ball will appear on screen from time to time; if caught, this can be used to temporarily freeze a guard. When you successfully enter the treasury, you then move on to the next level of gameplay.</desc>
	<path>./Oscar's Trash Race (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>It is the Grouch Day Picnic and three little grouches (Herman, Grungetta and Sloppy) want to win the Trash Race.

Game one is a practice race. The trash truck dumps one to five items. One of the trash cans at the top will then have a number on it. Press the button on the controller for that can the use the arrow keys to move it to the trash. Once you get the trash, move the grouch back to the top. You get one point per race. There are three races per game then Oscar appears to congratulate the winner (in his own grouchy way).

Game two is the same as game one except there will be a number on all three trash cans and you must select the one that corresponds to the number of items.

Both games one and two are one player only.

In games three and four, the truck dumps one to nine items. You again select the correct grouch but this time there are puddles, three in game three, several in game four. You get one point for each puddle you jump. If you step into a puddle, the grouch will play in it, delaying you. There are three races in game three, five in game four.

In game five, you run races one after another until Slimey the inchworm gets from one side of the screen to the other. Once Slimey get to the other side, the races ends. There are several puddles. You get one point per puddle jumped and one point per race completed.

Games six and seven are the same as five but it will rain sometimes. When it does, the puddles turn blue. If you jump a blue puddle, you get two points.

The trash items are:
bones
hangers
coffee mugs
toothbrush (presumably used)
old tin can
old televisions
old ten-gallon hats
old telephones
old tennis shoes
old dress shoes
junk mail
scissors
old toy boats
hammers

	<desc>This is an obstacle race in a space ship. The ship controls in a rather Asteroids-like way, in that you push left or right to rotate and press fire to thrust. Once you stop thrusting, the ship does not immediately stop, although it will slow down on its own. To stop sooner, you have to face away from the direction you are traveling and thrust.

First, you must pass a set number of hurdles. If there is a single hurdle, you must pass on the side indicated by the arrow. If there are two hurdles, you must pass in between them. If there are three, you can pass through them or go around. If you hit a hurdle, you must go back to the last successfully passed hurdle and do it again to continue.

After the hurdles, you must pop ten space balloons by running in to them. They appear one at a time at random spots on the screen. After you pop all ten balloons, you must dock in the space dock to end the race.

The difficulty switches are not used. You select your game variation by moving the joystick up or down.

Game variations
There are 28 variations. The odd numbered ones have fast maneuvering, the even numbered ones, slow.

The number of hurdles also varies. The first two have 10 hurdles, the next two, 14, then 22 (twice), 27 (twice), 35 (twice), 39 (four times), 47 (twice), 51 (twice), 54 (twice), 63 (twice), 64 (twice), 72 (twice), and 82 (twice).</desc>
	<path>./Outlaw (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You're a gunslinger in the old west! Outlaw features both one and two player games. In the one player version, your goal is to shoot a moving target as many times as possible in 99 seconds. In the two player version, each player tries to be the first to shoot his opponent ten times. Several game variations are included in both the one and two player versions. In the middle of the screen is one of several possible obstacles to make the game more difficult. A giant cactus, a stagecoach, a moving stagecoach, or a breakable wall all can block the target or provide some shelter for you to hide from your opponents shots. You also have the choice of unlimited fire, or only a six shooter. If you choose the six shooter, then each player must use up all six shots before either player can reload. And lastly, there is the "getaway" option. With getaway, a player may move immediately after firing; without getaway, a player must remain stationary for as long as his bullet is on the screen.</desc>
	<path>./Oystron (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>"In the Irata solar system lies the planet Stella. It is surrounded by an energy belt. In this belt there live space oysters. They make good food, so there are other outer space creatures living among them, that eat the oysters..." 

The space oysters are headed your way. You must shoot them to reveal pearls. Collect the pearls and deposit them in the Pearls Zone. Defend you pearls from being stolen or destroyed by attacking enemies. Near the end of each level, you must destroy the Oystron by dropping bombs. There is also a warp phase where you must travel at high speed between space oysters and enemies.</desc>
	<path>./Pac-Man (Atari) (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

	<desc>This tape contains five two or four player games in one package. They are:

Bop a Buggy: Drive your buggy through the course fastest to the finish line. Watch out for the buggy boppers, as they will throw bricks at you, slowing you up. In a two player game, each player controls a buggy and the computer controls the buggy boppers. In a four player game, two players control a buggy apiece and the other two control a buggy bopper apiece.

Tug of War: Simply pull the other team over the center line. In a two player game, each player control an entire team, each. In a four player game, each player controls one of the four players.

Wizard's Keep: Use the power of magic to destroy more targets for points than the opposing team. In a two player game, each player controls a pair of wizards. In a four player game, each player controls one wizard apiece. Note: Even though the screen in split, all wizards are shooting at the same targets so when a target is shot in one window, it will disappear in both.

Down on the Line: You must get a package from the left conveyor belt and pass it to the second worker who will then move it to the belt on the right that matches the package color. The game clock starts at 8:00 and the game ends when the clock reaches 5:00. In a two player game, each player controls a pair of workers. The package will pass from one worker to the other automatically. In a four player game, each player controls one worker apiece and must use the fire button to pass the package as well place it on the conveyor belt.

Handcar: A race to the finish line using railway handcars. In a two player game, each player controls one of the men on a handcar, the other works with him automatically. In a four player game, each player controls one of the men on both handcars.</desc>

	<path>./Pengo (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In this translation of the classic arcade-game "Pengo", you must defeat the enemy by pushing ice blocks together to crush them. You also can capture one if they are shocked and dizzy. There is also a time limit to make it a bit more difficult (you must do it in one minute).</desc>
	<path>./Pepsi Invaders - Coke Wins (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Coca-Cola asked Atari to create a game cartridge for Coca-Cola's Atlanta employees. So Atari went and altered Space Invaders. In this hack, the first five aliens are replaced by the letters P-E-P-S-I. The space ship that moves across the top has also been redesigned as the Pepsi red-white-and-blue circle logo. You have unlimited lives but only a three minute time limit to play. After the time runs out the game will flash with the words "Coke wins" at the top.</desc>
	<path>./Pesco (France) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>Pesco has found a good home. There is plenty of plankton to eat and the neighbors want him over for dinner. The only problem: He IS dinner. Pesco needs a new home. You must move about the maze, eating all the plankton (dashes). Be careful that the three crabs do not eat you. Your ultimate goal is to reach the ninth level, a new home.</desc>

	<path>./Phantom II - Pirate (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>This cartridge contains two games: Phantom II and Pirate.

Phantom II: Come fly the not-so-friendly skies.
Based on a 1979 Bally Midway coin-op game, you must fight your way through enemy planes to find and destroy the enemy bomber within the time limit. Do not ram the enemies as you only have one life. In the night time scenes, the enemy is only visible when the radar sweeps over them.

Pirate:
Can you find the treasure of the evil pirate "Up" Chuck LeDuc? Beware! His bony corpse wanders the island looking to protect it! Also watch out for snakes and the voodoo priestess!

Use your joystick to move about the island and use the button to fight, pick up an item, use an item and enter or exit the hut. You can carry nothing, a sword and/or a shovel but you must have the shovel when you reach the X that marks the treasure.</desc>
	<path>./Phantom Tank (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>In Phantom-Panzer, the player takes control of an assault vehicle in order to defend their "energy base" at the bottom of the screen from the attacking phantom tanks.

The game consists of three phases: the first phase takes place in a city and looks like a maze. It offers relative protection with the building walls. The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there's practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it's an all-out battle with the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player's base and no obstacles to stop them.

The player can only shoot one bullet at a time and has to destroy 20 tanks in each stage. Enemy bullets can be canceled by hitting them with one's own bullet. The player loses one life if they collide with one of the tanks or the enemy bullets. The game is over immediately, however, if an enemy tank or shell hits the player's energy base.</desc>
	<path>./Pharaoh's Curse (Germany).a26</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Phaser Patrol (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Phaser Patrol you are the pilot of an interstellar spaceship on a mission to defend the Human Federation from the deadly Dracon armada. Gameplay is similar to Star Raiders. You begin with a view of the sector map, and need to warp to a sector where the Dracon are located. Once you've reached your destination, the game switches to a first person point of view where you need to destroy all enemy fighters located in the sector. Once the sector is cleared, you can return to the sector map and warp to a new location. The mission is successful when all sectors containing enemy fighters have been cleared. Your ship has a limited amount of energy; energy is depleted by warping to new sectors, or by taking damage from enemy fighters. If your energy runs out the game is over, however you can recharge your ship by visiting one of the friendly starbases that are located throughout the galaxy (visiting a starbase will also repair any equipment that has been damaged, such as the photon torpedoes or sector scanner).  The game is timed, and the faster you can complete your mission the better your ranking at the end will be!</desc>
	<path>./Philly Flasher (USA).a26</path>

You are the commander of the Phoenix, and your mission is to reach an alien spaceship which has been draining your planets resources. The ship is guarded by four levels of bird like creatures. After clearing all four stages, the fifth level will be against a large, heavily shielded mothership. If the mothership is destroyed, the game will then repeat, but with increased speed and difficulty. To defeat the numerous enemies, the Phoenix is equipped with a laser cannon and a force field.</desc>
	<path>./Pick 'n' Pile (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.

In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</desc>
	<path>./Pick Up (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc>OK, here's the deal. If you want that lover of your dreams to get off their pedestal and go out with you, you need to present them with the right gifts. Then you can head over to the Love Nest Hotel to really score!

You start with your lover of a pedestal on the left and various items floating above you. You must shoot each item once to acquire it. If an item starts flashing, shoot it next because after a short time, you'll lose a chance. If you shoot an item a second time, you will lose it and a chance. Lose all your chances and the game is over. If you collect all the items needed, head over to the pedestal then head off the screen to the right. Head to the door of the hotel and the hotel sign will say how many times you have scored. Now head left to start the next level.</desc>
	<path>./Picnic (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are out enjoying a picnic, when suddenly a swarm of flies arrive! You control a fly swatter at the bottom of the screen; your goal in this game is to protect your hamburgers (located on the left and right bottom of the screen) from the attacking flies. When a fly is close enough, it will stick out its tongue to eat the food. If you can swat the fly right when it has its tongue out, it will be knocked out and fall into your fly trap. When all of the flies have been knocked into the trap, you will then need to face a large super fly before the level is complete (be careful, it can eat your food fast!) After knocking out the super fly, you move on to the next round. The game ends when all of your hamburgers have been completely eaten.</desc>
	<path>./Piece o' Cake (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Piece o' Cake you are a chef, and your goal is to successfully build cakes! At the bottom of the screen is a conveyor belt, and a platter will appear at the left side moving towards the right. You are at the top of the screen, and need to take cake layers from the oven and drop them onto the platter. The cake layers are different sizes, and you must drop them such that each layer is the same size or smaller than the one beneath it. After you have created a cake, you need to top it off with a cherry. If you are unable to successfully create a cake with the layers in the proper order and a topped with a cherry before the platter reaches the right side of the screen, it will fall off the conveyor and you lose a life. The different size cake layers come out of the oven randomly, so if you get a size you don't want it can be dropped off at the right side of the screen until a layer you do want appears. Although you can build cakes of different sizes, bonus points are earned for building a perfect cake consisting of one large layer, one medium layer, one small layer, and a cherry. As the game progresses, the conveyor will pick up speed to make cake building tougher.</desc>
	<path>./Pigs in Space - Starring Miss Piggy (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Now it's time for...PIIIIIIGS IN SPAAAAACE!!!

This game is really three smaller games. You select what to play to choosing which character you want.
For Captain Link Hogthrob, it is Chickenvaders. A Pigs in Space take in Atari's Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders.
While exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space chickens. Captain Link must destroy them before they make their way all the way to the planet. He does this by firing link sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken! You also lose a life. From time to time, Gonzo flies across the screen top in his saucer. You can hit him for points also.

Scoring
Hitting a chicken on...
Row one=10 points
Row two=20 points
Row three=50 points
Row four=70 points
Row five=100 points
Hitting Gonzo=300 points
Destroying all the chickens=1000 point bonus

If you select First Mate Piggy, you play Pastaroids. Somehow, Piggy has been ejected from the Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the bottom of the screen to the top and board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will lose ground, and thus time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't dawdle.

Scoring
Karate-chopping a meat ball=100 points
Boarding the Swinetrek=1000 points

If you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The Swinetrek has gotten trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The Gonzoids are standing on ledges, throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the Boomeray. When you fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life.

Scoring
You get one point for every mile you get through the mine.
Hitting a Gonzoid=100 points
Escaping the mine=1000 points

The difficulty switches do nothing. The only game selections are one player or two player, alternating.</desc>

Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint.</desc>

Dock with it so you can land and refuel later. When you come to the three enemy fuel depots, shoot each one to destroy it then make your way through a mine field to continue. If you come to the landing strip, just align your ship with it to land and a refueling truck will top off your tanks. As you move into night, the enemy ships become too dark to see. You can then create light, temporarily, by firing off shots.</desc>

	<path>./Pooyan (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home. Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground. If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig. But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig. But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too. If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit. Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair. Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall. Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present. Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</desc>

Brutus wanders around the screen and is constantly trying to catch you. If you collect a can of spinach, you can temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus will knock you out. Other objects such as bottles or birds are also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of your lives if you are hit. Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!</desc>

Place a brick=100 points
Getting out of the swamp screen=100 points
Each pole vault jump=lose 25 points
Falling into swamp=lose 100 points
Caught by Porky=lose a random number of points

	<desc>You are Brian Mareck. Your father created a super computer to help mankind but when it was switched on, something went wrong. You must deactivate the computer, but beware of the robots that have been reprogrammed to protect the computer at all costs. You must run and climb ladders to get to the 'power pills' and deactivate them. Avoid the robots as they will kill you. Once you have deactivated all the 'power pills' in that part of the lab (level), it is off to the next.</desc>
	<path>./Pressure Cooker (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Pressure Cooker, you are a cook whose job is to fullfill hamburger orders at "The Grille". Along the bottom of the screen you will see the orders for various types of hamburgers come in. Tomotoes, onions, lettuce, and cheese may all be requested and you need to collect the proper ingredients, put them on a hamburger, and drop it in the wrapping machine. The hamburgers will be coming down the left side of the screen on a conveyer belt as all other ingredients come flying out of the dispensers on the right. Make sure you catch all the ingredients and don't let any hamburgers fall off the end of the conveyer belt, otherwise you'll lose performance points! If your performance score drops to zero, you will be fired and the game ends. Of course, the ingredients will rarely come out in the desired order, so you also have the ability to toss an ingredient back without losing performance points if necessary. As you successfully create the ordered hamburgers and drop them in the proper warpping machine, the game difficulty will increase by upping the speed of the conveyer belt and increasing the complexity of the orders.</desc>
	<path>./Pressure Gauge (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>Pressure Guage's gameplay is a simple as its graphics, albeit not that easy to describe. On the left of the screen is a small colored line. On the right is a line that starts at the top of the screen and slowly descends. This is your timer. Next to the left line is a line that starts at the bottom and rises to the top. When it reaches the top, it restarts at the bottom. The object is to press your button when the rising line on the left is within the small line on the left. This will cause a new line to rise. If you press the button when the rising line is not in the left small line or let the rising line reach the top, the new line will lower. To clear the level, get the new line all the way to the top. If you do not get the new line to the top before the descending line on the right reaches the bottom, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Private Eye (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are the great French private eye Pierre Touche. Your job is to capture the criminal Henri Le Fiend and send him to jail. To do this, you will first need to find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you: questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for! If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum, or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks so there will be a greater area to search! In addition to the various cases, several difficulty settings are included which control the speed of your car and how high you can jump.</desc>
	<path>./Qb (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>Explaining Qb is simple, even if achieving your goal proves not to be. You must slide blocks in the left playing field to match the pattern in the right field. You can jump from block to block, as long as they are adjacent. When you land on a block with fruit on it, you get extra points but beware of the monsters.</desc>
	<path>./Q-bert (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>
	<path>./Q-bert's Qubes (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Q*Bert's Qubes is the sequel to the game Q*Bert and features similar gameplay, but is now in three dimensions. Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.</desc>
	<path>./Quadrun (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Quadrun is an arcade style action game for one player. The planet of Quad has been invaded, and all of the "Runts" are imprisoned; your goal is to rescue them! The screen is broken up into four sectors (one on each edge of the screen), with the prison in the center. Your character is equipped with three phaser balls; on the screen you will see the captors running up and down vertically, and you need to hit them with a phaser ball. When hit, the captor will be destroyed and one of the Runts will be able to escape. The Runts will run back and forth horizontally, and you need to catch them before they run into the deadly wall at the edge of the screen. To make the game more challenging, you are only equipped with three phaser balls! This means after firing a phaser ball, you will need to quickly run around to the other side of the screen and catch it before it disappears. You will also lose a phaser ball if one of the captors collides with your character. Lose all three phaser balls, and the game is over. Also, there is a critter counter at the top of the screen; if you fail to destroy one of the captors or if one of the escaped Runts runs into a wall, the critter counter will decrease. If the critter counter runs out, the game ends.</desc>
	<path>./Quest for Quintana Roo (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are Yucatan Sam on a quest to explore the temple of Quintana Roo. Your goal is to find the vault which is hidden somewhere within and return with the treasure that is inside. You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!</desc>
	<path>./Quick Step! (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Quick Step a kangaroo and squirrel are competing against each other to earn points by jumping on trampolines. The screen is made up of an array of trampolines which scroll downward. As trampolines appear at the top of the screen, they will be grey in color; as soon as it turns pink, the trampoline is now in play. Each time a critter jumps on a trampoline, the color will change to that critters color (green for the kangaroo, or blue for the squirrel). If you jump on a pink trampoline, 3 points are earned; when a trampoline falls off the bottom of the screen that is your color, 6 points are earned (so although no points are earned by jumping on your opponents color, you want to try to get as many trampolines as possible your color in order to earn points when they reach the bottom).  If you fall off of the bottom of the screen, a life is lost; the game ends when one player has no more lives left and whomever has more points wins. A few bonuses can also be found; if you see a white trampoline, that is a magic hat; collect it and then jump onto the same space as your opponent to temporarily stun him. Each player also begins the game with 6 tricky traps; pressing the button lays a trap causing the trampoline to disappear so no one can land there.   Each level in the game gets progressively faster; at the end of a level, there will be a single column of fast moving trampolines to jump up, so be careful!</desc>
	<path>./Rabbit Transit (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are a rabbit who is just trying to get to where you can get a mate and make like a mathematician by multiplying. First you must get through the meadow and across the ledges without losing life and limb.

You start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game start back at the beginning only harder.</desc>

	<desc>You have been challenged, or maybe you challenged, someone to a game of racquetball.

To serve, press the red button. You hit the ball by moving your player to where the shadow of the ball is about level with your feet. The racquet will swing automatically. When you serve, the ball must hit the front wall before it hits the floor. Your opponent can then hit the ball before it lands on the floor or he can let it bounce but you can only let it bounce once. It cannot bounce twice. You serve every time until you miss. If you are serving and your opponent misses, you get one point. You can only get points on rounds where you serve. First player to twenty-one points, wins.

	<path>./Radar Lock (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Radar Lock is an arcade style action game. The player is the pilot of a delta-wing fighter and their objective is to destroy the enemy fleet. There are five missions of increasing difficulty, each with a unique variety of enemies to destroy.

The player's jet is equipped with machine guns, guided missiles, and, in later levels, proximity mines, which can be used to destroy the Drones, Interceptors, Patrollers, Bombers, and other enemy fighters that the player will encounter. The jet has a limited amount of fuel, and at the end of each mission players will need to dock with the fuel tanker to replenish their fuel supply.

To help out during gameplay, there is an instrument panel at the bottom of the screen which displays your radar, fuel gauge, and weapons status.</desc>
	<path>./Raft Rider (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Raft Rider you are floating down a river on a raft made out of logs. Your goal is to guide the raft as far down the river as possible while avoiding the many obstacles. You will come across dangerous rocks, trees, beavers (which chop down trees making more obstacles!), and even a moose, all of which can sink your raft. For each segment of river you travel 125 points are earned, and additional bonus points may be earned by collecting gold nuggets which you will encounter in the river from time to time. You begin the game with three rafts (bonus rafts can be earned), and the game ends when all of the rafts have been sunk. Several difficulty levels are available which control the speed of the current, as well as the speed of the beaver and moose.</desc>
	<path>./Raiders of the Lost Ark (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!</desc>
	<path>./Rainbow Invaders (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>It's the year 3006, and the evil Rainbow Invaders from the planet Pacco, are headed to Earth! They look like the ridiculous aliens depicted in 1980s arcade games, but are extremely dangerous and their goal is to exterminate all humans! You command a fleet of spaceships and you must defeat all of the Invaders to save Earth! Good luck!

This game is inspired by the game Space Invaders but with a twist. Yes, there are rows of invaders moving across the screen then moving down, firing as they go. Yes, your ship moves left and right at the bottom of the screen, firing up. Yes, an enemy ship will travel across the top of the screen. But there, the similarities end. For one thing, there are no shields to hide behind. Your ship does have a shield you activate by pulling back on the joystick but be warned, it drains all your energy so when you use it, after it is gone, you cannot move or fire for a second.

Also, the aliens are not dropping just electric shots. They also drop any of sixteen Special Shots. Some of these will help you, most will hinder you.

The Special Shots do the following:

1. Your ship's movements and shots become faster. Duration: ten seconds
2. Your ship's left/right movements are inverted. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
3. Your ship's movements and shots become slower. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
4. Enemies do not fire. Duration: ten seconds
5. Inavders' electric shots descend at maximum speed. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
6. Invaders' electric shots track your ship. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
7. Invaders stop moving. Duration: five seconds
8. Invaders move very fast. Duration: one second
9. All shots, your and the invaders, become invisible. Duration: ten seconds
10. If you shoot at an invader or the enemy ship and miss, a randomly generated invader could appear. And your Shoot Abort option, wherein when you shoot again the last shot disappears, is temporary disabled. Duration: thirty seconds
11. Your ship freezes. Duration: one second
12. Invaders electric shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
13. Your shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
14. Your shots dont stop when they hit an enemy but continue straight to the top of the screen, killing any enemies it hits. Duration: five seconds
15. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you dont blast it immediately, every few moments a new invader is randomly generated. Duration: thirty seconds
16. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you dont blast it before the bonus expires, your ship will explode. Duration: ten seconds. Meaning you have ten seconds to shoot that invader or lose a life</desc>

	<desc>EEEEEK! Green is going wild! Red on your right! Blue at your back! Yipes, yellow! Quick! Jam it, slam it. Ram It! Put your Ramroid into action and rifle away.

You, the Ramroid, are on a track in the center of the screen. You can aim left and right to fire. On both sides are colored bars that begin to randomly advance towards the center. You must shoot these bars to drive them back, preferably off the screen. If a bar starts flashing, it is a bonus bar and shooting it gets you larger points as well as clearing it from the screen completely. Be warned, though, that sometimes the bar will reappear on the opposite side of the screen.

A round ends when:
1. You have cleared all the colored bars from the screen or
2. The timer at the bottom, which starts at five thousand, reaches zero or
3. The colored bars have blocked off part of the screen and you clear the rods where you can

After three rounds, the game is over.</desc>

	<desc>George, Lizzy and Ralph were just ordinary Americans, until an experiment went wrong, turning them into a Gorilla, Lizard and Werewolf respectively. Following this, the three of them plan to go round destroying buildings, and up to 3 human players can join in.

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human</desc>
	<path>./Raster Fahndung (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>You are presented with a screen full of squares, thirty-two squares wide by twenty squares high. The object of the game is to find a particular set of squares that measure six by six squares. This sounds simple but you are timed. You can view the pattern you need by pressing fire but don't stay long as this makes the timer speed up to twice as fast while you are in that screen. In a two player game, the first player to find the correct pattern collects one point. The game ends when the timer runs out or, in two player, one player reaches nine points.

You start with ninety seconds. If you select the easy difficulty, the second puzzle with have five less seconds. Time decreases per screen until you reach twenty seconds, the lowest time. On the hard setting, you have to clear as many boards as you can in ninety seconds, total.</desc>
	<path>./Reactor (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</desc>

Space pirates are in the area and the robot interceptors are working against us. Your orders are to fly your F-117 Starwarrior to Terra I, destroying anything that tries to harm you.

You can move your ship up, down, left or right. You begin with a top-down view if the F-117, facing towards the bottom of the screen. Meteors and later space pirates come from the bottom moving up and you must shoot them. After you get through these, you switch to a side view of the ship and face left or right. Robot interceptors will come from the sides and must be destroyed then fish force fields (yes, fish force fields) will come from the top, moving down and you must shoot the fish-shaped devices to destroy them. They are Terra I's last defensive line so when you get through them, you win.

In the two player games, player one controls the F-117's left and right movement and player two controls the up and down movement therefore players must work together. Firing alternates between both players in two second intervals.</desc>

You begin in a forest and must make your way through it and over the river. Next you enter the village. You must make your way through and enter the desert. Through all this, you must shoot or avoid chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas. Chimpanzees are harmless but orangutans can capture you and place you in a cage in the village and gorillas can capture you and/or shoot you. If you are captured, you must press your button to escape then head south to the desert. After the desert, you enter the poison caves. There are no apes here but you will lose a life point every second you are within. These caves are a maze you must get through but be advised that not all exits lead to the human stronghold. Some exits come out in the forest or desert. Once you reach the human stronghold, you will get a splash screen then your total points then you restart in the forest at a harder level.</desc>

	<desc>You must build three walls above the tomato plants at the bottom. You must also dodge tomato bombs shot by the tomato plants, shoot tomato vines that grow on any part of the wall, shoot cherry tomatoes (or just dodge their shots) and shoot or dodge beefsteak tomatoes.

To capture a brick, you shoot it once. Then to place it, you shoot vertically at the wall once. You cannot place bricks horizontally.

The game's default is level setting six, which has all enemies and each round is harder than the last. The level settings are as follows:
Level one: Tomato plants only and every round is the same difficulty
Level two: Same as one but adds beefsteak tomatoes
Level three: Same as two but adds cherry tomatoes
Level four: Same as three but adds brick-growing vines
Level five: Same as three but each round gets harder than the last
Level six: Same as four but each round gets harder than the last
Level seven: Same as five but the tomato bombs are wider
Level eight: Same as six but the tomato bombs are wider.

When the left difficulty switch is set to B, you have unlimited lives. If set to A, you have four lives.
The right difficulty switch affects the game speed; A faster, B slower.

The points are:
Killing the beefsteak tomato=5 points
Killing the cherry tomato=50 points
Shooting the brick-growing vine=5 points
Capturing a brick=10 points
Placing a brick in a wall=20 points
Completing the first wall=1,000 points

	<desc>River Raid is a vertically scrolling action game. You fly a jet up a river in an attempt to destroy bridges which are vital to the enemy. The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life.</desc>
	<path>./River Raid II (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You're the pilot of an F-14 assault jet, assigned to the dangerous mission of taking out an enemy bridge at the top of a heavily guarded river. In River Raid II, the gameplay is similar to the original River Raid, but with a few additions. For each mission you start out on an aircraft carrier. After a successful takeoff, you need to get past enemy forces located over the ocean which guard the entrance to the river. Make sure to collect plenty of fuel from the refueling jets, since once you reach the river fuel will become scarce! Next you will have to make your way up the treacherous river channel until you finally reach, and hopefully destroy, the bridge. But the level isn't over yet, for now  you have to return to the aircraft carrier and land safely. After completing all of this, you move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to the expanded levels, another change in River Raid II is the ability to control the altitude of your plane. You can fly high above everything, or fly low into the channel to take out enemy tanks and barges.</desc>
	<path>./Road Runner (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>This game is based on an arcade game that was released by Atari.

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.</desc>
	<path>./Robin Hood (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Robin Hood is an action game where you need to rescue Maid Marian who is being held by the Sheriff of Nottingham in a castle (and while you're at it, steal some gold to give to the poor)! Gameplay takes place on several different screens which have different objectives. First you will need to make your way through Sherwood Forest; numerous henchman are hiding here, so use your arrows to shoot them. Surviving the forest, the next section takes place outside of the castle; naturally, numerous henchman guard the castle gate. While dodging incoming arrows, you need to shoot enough of the henchman to cause the gate to open. Once it opens, you can enter the castle for the final scene. Inside the castle you will be able to find Maid Marian behind one of the many doors, and gold behind another. The rest of the doors have henchman hiding behind them, but if you can find the Maid Marian or the gold then you win this round and the game repeats at a tougher skill level.</desc>
	<path>./Robot Tank (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</desc>
	<path>./Roc 'n Rope (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides. Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points. 

Your player also cannot take a fall, except for extremely small ones unless he is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to "shake" the rope until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope. Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the player.

There are 4 distinct levels; the cliff-side, the windmill, the waterfall and the peak. Completing all of these levels will restart the game with faster enemies and power-ups located in different places.</desc>

	<path>./Room of Doom (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are trapped in a room with a monster. As if that wasn't bad enough, there are gunmen outside the room shooting at you when the portals open. To advance, you must shoot the gunman when the portals are open. You can shoot the monster but it will only be stunned and if you stay in the same room too long, the monster becomes immune to your weapon.

There are sixty-four game variations. In some, the gunmen shoot in a straight line only, others they aim at where ever you are, others are slow, others fast, others the portals all open at the same time and stay open, others various portals open and close.

Scoring
Shoot a gunman=75 points per gunman
Stun a monster=50 points each time</desc>

	<path>./Rush Hour (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc>It's rush hour and you're in a hurry, but there's a major traffic jam.  You race along a five-lane freeway, in control of a car equipped with weapons, on a mission to destroy certain carrier cars which are causing traffic jams.  You must weave in and out of traffic at high speeds blasting slow-moving cars in your path to reach your destination.  Along the way, you must also avoid obstacles such as destroyed cars, barricades, nails, and  oil slicks on the road.  A radar tracks the enemy and warns of coming danger.

Collisions with other vehicles and objects will damage your car and cause malfunction. The car will repair itself slowly as time lapses, or you may pull over for a quick repair, but you may let your target escape if you take too long. You only have one car, and the game is over when this car is lost.</desc>
	<path>./Saboteur (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc>You are Hotot, a cybernetic life form from a serene planet in a distant galaxy. Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur.

On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly.

In Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt. Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you must destroy the warhead one-on-one.

In the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course, the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix that will try to hold you off. If you take to log to destroy the warhead, it will escape into space. Whether you destroy it or not, you will then return to the Rocket Construction Site at a harder level.</desc>

	<path>./Save the Whales (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc>Some whales are traveling from the Arctic Ocean to Baja to breed. The bad news is a whaling ship in the area is attacking them. You must use your submarine to shoot the nets or harpoons and radioactive debris to save the whales.

After you start the game, the whales will move from left to right along the bottom of the screen. The ship will start throwing down nets or harpoons, depending on the settings, to kill the whales. You must aim at the nets, in any direction and shoot them. After several nets/harpoons have been sent, radioactive debris will flow from the right side on the screen. This is up too high to hurt the whales but it can hurt you. You must shoot it as well. If your sub gets hit five times, the game is over. In a two-player game, one player is the sub and the other is the whaling ship.</desc>
	<path>./SCSIcide (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>In this game, you are a hard drive read head and must gather the bits in their correct color-coded order. There are ten tracks and bits of various colors will race along from left to right. You must move to the track with the correct color bit and press the button when it is at you to clear it then it is on to the next track. If the needed bit gets past you off the right side of the screen, it will enter the buffer on the bottom left of the screen. If the buffer overflows, the hard drive will crash and game over. You score is displayed in hexadecimal. The first two numbers are the level followed by your score.</desc>

	<desc>Sea Battle is a strategic game for two players only. Each player controls a fleet of ships including Submarines, Destroyers, and Battleships. The goal is to engage and sink enemy ships. The winner is the player who commands the troop transport ship into the opponent's harbor. There are two phases in Sea Battle; the strategy phase, and the combat phase. The strategy phase includes maneuvering your fleet into different strategic positions on the map, laying mines, and repair fleets. Opponents engage in ship-to-ship warfare in the combat phase, triggered by the ENGAGE button. Each of the different types of ships has there own strengths and weaknesses, such as weapon range and maneuverability.</desc>
	<path>./Sea Monster (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>In Sea Monster you control a ship out in the open seas. Beneath the waves are numerous sea monsters, many of which are attacking your ship! Your ship is located at the top of the screen, and your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various sea monsters that swim by. The deeper in the ocean the monster is, the more points it is worth. The game ends when all of your ships have been destroyed. Gameplay is for one or two players, and several game variations are available which control the speed and difficulty.</desc>
	<path>./Seahawk (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>A fast-paced shooting game that has you in control of a fighter jet named the Sea Hawk, blasting away at enemy helicopters and ships. Two weapons are at your command: Missiles and bombs. If an enemy missile hits your plane, your pilot will eject and use his parachute. Guide him to a friendly ship and a life won't be lost. There are no levels to complete or bosses to beat, and gameplay can continue for as long as you can last.</desc>
	<path>./Seaquest (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Your divers are out in the ocean collecting treasure; now that they have found what they're looking for, you need to pilot a submarine and return them safely to the surface! You can carry up to six divers at a time, and when you safely return the six divers to the surface, you move on to the next, faster level. Your sub has a limited supply of oxygen; if your oxygen meter gets too low, you will need to surface to replenish the oxygen supply. If you surface with less than six divers, you lose one of the divers. If you surface with no divers at all, then your sub will explode. To make your task more challenging, numerous giant sharks and enemy submarines travel throughout the waters and can destroy your sub on contact. To help out with these enemies, you have an unlimited supply of torpedoes which can be fired to destroy both the sharks and subs. As the levels progress, the game gets faster and more enemies appear at a time.</desc>
	<path>./Seawolf (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>This game is inspired by the Brøderbund game Seafox and the Midway coin-op games Sea Wolf and Sea Wolf II, although it is not a direct conversion of any of them.

You are a submarine along the bottom of the sea. You must sink ships with your torpedoes.

You move your sub left or right with the joystick and launch a torpedo with the button. Try to shoot past the mines as they waste torpedoes and give no points. Try to hit ships, destroyers, enemy subs and PT boats. Try to avoid hitting the white ships as these will cause your torpedoes to rebound back down. You have fifty torpedoes and ninety-nine fuel. You lose a life when you run out of fuel. After three lives, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Secret Agent (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc>They've given you a number and taken away your name - "Secret Agent Man" by Johnny Rivers

You, the Secret Agent, must catch the falling agent items, like U.S. documents, money cases and money bags, while avoiding the undesirables, like bugs, grenades and guns. After a time, a tone will sound. This is when the boats on the water below you will stop moving and you need to get above them and 'make the hand off'. Be careful, though, for although the boats stopped moving, the falling items have not. In two-player games, the players alternate.</desc>
	<path>./Secret Quest (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.

You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring.

Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.

Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen. Hence, the game won't go long if you run out of energy.

Weapon energy use and damage
Energy sword=1 energy and 2 strength
Sonic blaster=2 energy and 4 strength
Particle beam=4 energy and 8 strength.

Scoring
Bear trap=50 points
Potato Man=100 points
Chopper=150 points

	<path>./Sentinel (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Sentinel is a side scrolling action game. Several worlds have fallen victim of an alien attack, and you need to free them. To do this, a glowing orb called the Sentinel has been sent which can absorb the alien energy. As the Sentinel floats above the various, scrolling landscapes, you need to protect it from attacks by using the light gun to destroy enemies and enemy fire. If you don't destroy an enemy, it will deplete the Sentinels energy supply which will eventually destroy it. There are four levels of increasing difficulty, each with a large boss at the end. To help out on your mission, several bonuses may be encountered from time to time; increased firepower and energy can be acquired when you shoot the bonus capsules that appear. Three levels of difficulty are available.</desc>
	<path>./Shootin' Gallery (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Shootin' Gallery is a target shooting game similar to Sega's Carnival. You control a gun at the bottom of the screen while various types of targets move left and right above. Given a limited amount of ammo, you need to earn as many points as possible by shooting the targets (which include trains, snails, frogs, kangaroos, monkeys, and more). Naturally more points are awarded for targets that are further away or tougher to hit. At the top of the screen is a cuckoo clock which counts down; when time runs out, a cuckoo will eat some of your remaining ammo! To avoid this, the clock can be shot which resets the timer. Every 20,000 points bonus ammo is awarded. When all of your ammo is gone, the game is over and the score calculated.</desc>

	<path>./Shuttle Orbiter (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You must get ten parts from an orbiting factory to an incomplete space station. Unfortunately, a comet passed near Earth and left a space debris field that you will need to avoid.

After the launch, you will see the Earth being circled but four colored dots. At the bottom will be the elapsed time, remaining fuel and four indicator bars. These bars are your orbit altitudes and their colors correspond to the colors of the orbiting dots: white for the shuttle, gold for the station, red for the orbiting factory, and green for the fuel depot.

When you are lower in orbit than an item, you move faster. If you are higher than an item, you move slower. You must match orbit and location with something to dock. Once you are close to something, you switch to the maneuvering display. Now you can interact with an item or avoid it, as in the debris. If you hit something, whether debris or man-made orbiting item, you begin to leak fuel. This means you will use fuel even if you are not firing thrusters. You also have a 25% chance to damage the part in the cargo hold.

Game variations
The difficulty switches and select switch are not used. After you press fire on the joystick, move the stick up or down to select the difficulty level, from 0 to 3. Game 0 has no space debris.

There is no score, just the amount of time it takes you and whether or not you got all ten parts in place without running out of fuel.</desc>
	<path>./Sinistar (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc>An unreleased prototype of the classic arcade title.

The player pilots a lone spacecraft, and must create "Sinibombs" by shooting at drifting planetoids and catching the crystals that are thereby released. Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. At the same time, enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Meanwhile, enemy warrior ships can also directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.</desc>
	<path>./Sir Lancelot (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>A damsel in distress is being held in a castle by a fire breathing dragon! As Sir Lancelot, you need to ride your winged horse Pegasus to the rescue. Each level in this action game consists of two screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.</desc>
	<path>./Skate Boardin' (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In this game, you have five minutes to get from your front steps to the steps of the school. You have to get through this maze and conquer 30 tubes and ramps AND get to the school.

You start at your front steps. To get on the board, move left or right and while moving, press fire. When you are on your board, just push the direction you want to turn. Press fire to jump and press and hold fire to jump and land in a crouched position. You will also see rails, walls and hurdles but these you must avoid as they will make you crash.

To jump a ramp, just ride towards it and be aligned with it. To clear a tube, ride through it while crouched. If you ride through grass, it will slow you down. To get back up to speed, either crash into something or ride through grass until you stop then get the skateboard going again.

The scoreboard at the top of the screen is not an obstacle. When you get to it, you just keep going.</desc>
	<path>./Skeet Shoot (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Skeet Shoot, your goal is to earn as many points as you can by shooting clay pigeons. When you press the joystick button, your player will appear on the screen in one of several locations, and a clay pigeon will fire from the center. You need to shoot the clay pigeon before it disappears off the screen to earn a point. The game can be played by one or two players, and numerous game variations are included which control the level of difficulty, speed, and whether a player appears in a fixed or random location on the screen.</desc>
	<path>./Skeleton (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>You hear faint footsteps, so you follow the sound through the

is a Skeleton; and it doesn't look friendly. Acting quickly, 
you blast it with your Undead Disintegrator and the Skeleton 
vanishes in a flash of colour. But as you reload your UD, you 
hear footsteps again; and you wonder; are you the hunter or the 
hunted in this nightmare?

This game was inspired by the TRS-80 CoCo game The Phantom Slayer. In this title, you move through a maze, searching for skeletons. Find them before they find you. Once you encounter a skeleton, press a button to disintegrate it. There are ten skeletons per maze and eight mazes in total.</desc>

There are two different modes of gameplay. In slalom mode, there are a series of gates you need to ski through; missing any will result in a penalty to your time. In downhill mode you just need to ski to the bottom as fast as possible. Each mode includes five different skill levels which affect the length of the course (and the number of gates in slalom mode.)</desc>

	<desc>Sky Diver is an action game for two players. The goal is to score the most points by jumping from a plane, opening your parachute,  and guiding your sky diver safely to a landing pad. The longer you wait to open your parachute, the more points you earn for a successful landing, but don't wait too long or your chute won't open at all! For each jump, there will be varying wind conditions which blow your sky diver off course. A wind sock at the bottom of the screen will help you determine the wind speed and direction so you can compensate. There are nine jumps total, and the player with the most points at the end wins.</desc>
	<path>./Sky Jinks (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Fly slalom around pylons (right of the red ones, left of the blue ones). Avoid skipping a pylon, hitting the pylons, trees or hot-air balloons. Try to get the best time you can. If you fly to the wrong side of a pylon, you will get a three second penalty for each missed pylon. The total number of pylons remaining is at the top of the screen above the time. If you hit a tree, pylon or balloon your plane will crash to the ground. You will not die but this will hurt your time as your plane has to take off again. Hitting a pylon will not hurt your pylon count. You will still get credit for the pylon but will lose time as your plane was slowed. You can press the fire button to throttle up or release to throttle down. Move the joystick left or right to turn. You bank into turns so you need to time turns as it is not instant. Up and down on the joystick do nothing.</desc>
	<path>./Sky Skipper (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You pilot a plane and must rescue animals from cages where they were placed by gorillas. To do this, you fly over a gorilla and drop a bomb, knocking the gorilla off its feet. Once this is done, the animals will be out of their cages and you just touch each one to rescue it. The animal cages will only be open for a limited time, then the gorilla will get back on its feet. You must then knock it down again.

You mustn't take too long rescuing the animals or you will run out of fuel. If you run out of fuel, run into a gorilla or the course walls or, strangely, a cloud, you lose a plane. You begin the game with four planes.

Difficulty switches
Set to A for faster plane, set to B for slower plane.

Game variations
Game 1...Tricky flying course
Game 2...Tricky flying course and clouds
Game 3...Tricky flying course, clouds and faster plane.

Scoring

	<path>./Slot Racers (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The goal of this two-players console game is to move your vehicle in a maze so you can shoot missiles at your opponent without getting shot at. 

The games features four different mazes to choose from, each faster than the last. Another feature lets you decide to make the missiles faster or slower than the car. The difficulty switch determines whether you can shoot a missile while one of your own is still on the screen. Otherwise, your missile has to hit the enemy or be retrieved by your vehicle before you can launch another one.

You steer your car with a joystick. Each time you hit your enemy with a missile, you get a point. The fist player to get 25 points is the winner.</desc>

	<desc>Smurfette has been kidnapped and is being held atop a platform in Gargamel's castle. The player controls a smurf across the screen and must jump over obstacles, away from spiders, eventually up to smurfette to rescue her. Completing of this task restarts the game with faster moving obstacles and it also takes longer (more scenes) to get to Gargamel's castle.</desc>
	<path>./Smurfs Save the Day (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In this children's learning game, you learn music, sorting and color mixing.

With Harmony Smurf, the computer will play four, five or six notes and you must repeat them. After the notes play, they fall to the ground and you must put them in their correct spots. The highest level has invisible notes, you must match by sound only.

There are two modes, changed by the select switch.
In Game Mode, the computer plays and you must duplicate it. In Toy Mode, there are six notes on the ground and you can make any tune you like, the computer doesn't create a tune.

With Handy Smurf, items will move along a conveyor belt and you must sort them into one of three bins. You press the button to close or open gaps to guide the object but don't press too soon or the gap returns to the way it was before after a short time.

In Game Mode, the first five items are sorted by shape, the next five by size and the next five by color then the sequence repeats only faster. In Toy Mode, after each item is sorted, the sorting criteria (shape, size or color) changes randomly.

With Greedy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf has a colored liquid in a glass. Using blue, red, yellow and white spigots, Greedy must put the same color liquid or mix liquids to get the same color in his glass. If he gets it right, he and Clumsy drink up. If he gets it wrong, the glass drains out.

In Game Mode, the colors start easy and get progressively harder. In Toy Mode, the color selection in Clumsy's glass is random.

There is no time limit or penalty if you get something wrong.</desc>
	<path>./Snail Against Squirrel (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>Would you kindly help a little squirrel whom often you found playing in the woods?  I am a very, very friendly squirrel;  I swear, I never intend to hurt that poor snail.  As it becomes colder and colder, I want nothing more than to store some nuts in my caves, lest I should be no more after the winter.  But why in the world is that greedy snail always hiding somewhere to rob me of my nuts, just like those highway men?  See what a dilemma I am involved in?  To keep away from that cunning snail, should I go on carry the nut to my cave or gather a newly ripe one?</desc>
	<path>./Sneak 'n Peek (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Sneak 'n Peek is a computerized version of the game hide and seek. The game is played by two players (or one player against the computer); one player will close his eyes while the other player hides somewhere. After the second player is hidden, the first player needs to locate him in the shortest time possible. After the second player has been located, the roles will then be reversed. The game takes place in an old house with three rooms available as well as the front yard to hide in; each of these four locations contains five different places to hide. The game can be played with fixed or variable hiding locations; in the fixed game, the hiding locations will always be found in the same place, and the variable game will move the hiding places around each time a room is entered. Two difficulty levels are available; in the tougher setting, the entrance to the hiding places is narrower making it tougher to find.</desc>
	<path>./Snoopy and the Red Baron (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Snoopy takes to the skies on his Sopwith Camel doghouse to bring down the Red Baron.  A Defender-esque shooter geared more towards the young gamer, it is up to Snoopy to blow his foe out of the sky while catching the various treats (bones, hamburgers, root beer) that the Red Baron drops to gain bonus points.  Shoot down the Red Baron enough times, and be rewarded a medal.  Fail, and the Red Baron lives to fight another day.</desc>
	<path>./Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc>Oh, no! The Evil Queen has created a poison apple and wants to give it to Snow White! We, the seven dwarfs, have to find Prince Charming so he can save her!

You play as one of the seven dwarfs. First you move through your diamond mine, collecting diamonds. You can collect up to twelve diamonds but you must collect one ruby to leave the mine. In HARD setting, avoid obstacles and falling rocks.

After you grab the ruby, you must cross a river on a log. In the HARD setting, beware of the bat that will try to drop rocks upon you, You can press your button to use a diamond's magic to scare away the bat for a short time.

After the river, you must make your way through the forest without getting grabbed by the evil trees. In the HARD setting, you must also be careful of the bat dropping rocks. You can, again, use diamonds to drive it off. You must hit the flashing white line to exit the forest. After this, you return to the screen with all the dwarfs lined up, dancing, while the Evil Queen is driven away from Snow White.</desc>
	<path>./Solar Fox (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Solar Fox, your mission is to guide a space ship though a solar cell matrix and collect as many of the solar cells as you can. When all of the cells in a matrix have been collected, you move on to the next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer; if you collect all solar cells before this timer runs out, you will earn bonus points and skip ahead a level. The game ends when you have lost all of your space ships.</desc>
	<path>./Solar Plexus (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>You are salvaging for fuel in the far reaches of the galaxy when you spot an artificial sun in the area. You need that fuel before you run out but watch out for colliding with that sun.

You start on the screen with the artificial sun bouncing around and a fuel item on the right. You must grab the fuel before your ship is out of fuel, as it uses fuel at an impressive rate. If you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Beware of the sun as its touch is instant death. After every two fuels you grab, the pace picks up. You can accelerate by pressing your button.</desc>
	<path>./Solar Storm (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Solar Storm is an arcade style action game where you control a spaceship to defend your home planet. Deadly Deltoid ships will be flying in trying to destroy your planet; in addition to this danger, a far off sun has exploded sending debris towards you. Your job is to shoot everything that is heading your way before it reaches your planet (the bottom of the screen). Each time an enemy ship or some debris makes it past you, your planets shield absorbs the energy and heats up; if it overheats, it will be destroyed and the game ends. If your laser ship crashes into any incoming danger, you lose a life (the game also ends if all lives are lost). Every 500 points there is a bonus screen where you have a chance to earn more lives. The longer you last, the faster the game will become.</desc>
	<path>./Solaris (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The Zylons are back, and are attempting another takeover of the galaxy! Your goal is to destroy all of the Zylon fighters you encounter, rescue cadets that are trapped on Zylon planets, and to find the planet Solaris to protect it from the Zylons. Your spaceship is equipped with a galactic map which can be used to warp to different sectors of the galaxy. The map shows the location of Zylon squadrons, Zylon planets, federation starbases, wormholes, clusters of stars, and Solaris when you find it. By warping to the correct sector, you can battle the numerous types of Zylon fighters to keep them from attacking federation bases and planets. Your spaceship has a limited amount of fuel; when you see the fuel gage get too low, you will need to warp to a federation starbase to refuel (make sure you leave enough fuel to warp). When flying over a Zylon controlled planet, you will see your cadets on the surface. If you rescue all of the cadets as you fly past, you will receive bonus points and an extra spaceship. The Zylon's have many different types of fighters which you will encounter, as well as some narrow corridors with blockades which you will need to clear in order to reach new locations in the galaxy.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcerer (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Sorcerer is an arcade action game which takes place long ago when wizards and sorcerers ruled the earth. The evil wizards have decided to attempt to conquer the earth, and have sent numerous waves of creatures to stop all of the good sorcerers. Your goal is to destroy the various creatures! On the beginning screen of the game, there is a flying platform: you need to jump and catch this platform which will allow you to fly anywhere on the screen. Next you will need to fight screen after screen of dangerous creatures by firing an energy charge at them. After you have successfully destroyed the creatures on the current screen, a treasure will be left behind which can be collected for bonus points and then you can move on to the next screen. From time to time, you may also encounter a cloud with deadly lightning bolts that you must avoid! The longer you survive, the faster the enemies become. Two levels of difficulty as well as a practice mode are available.</desc>
	<path>./Sorcerer's Apprentice (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Based off the animated Disney classic "Fantasia", Sorcerer's Apprentice puts players in charge of Mickey Mouse as he collects and shoots stars and meteors on the mountaintops to keep the walking brooms from filling the Sorcerer's cavern below.

For every caught star, a bucket appears to remove some of the water from the cavern. Mickey also has the opportunity to catch the brooms before they get to the bottom of the stairs and flood the cavern further.

If Mickey fails to provide enough buckets, or stop the brooms, they will flood the cavern, and the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Space Attack (USA).a26</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Space Battle (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>Space Battle is a one player game that pits you against the computer.

Six alien fleets of different sizes are attacking your mothership, and it's up to you to defend it using your three squadrons. Alien ships will dodge your attacks and will attack you with photon blasts.

There are two game modes; Radar Mode, which is more strategy, and Battle Mode, which is all out action.</desc>
	<path>./Space Cavern (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are the commander of an intergalactic starship on a mission to explore new, strange planets. After landing on a new world and beginning to explore the numerous caverns, you discover the planet is inhabited by the deadly Electrosauri. These creatures can generate lethal electric charges, and are now after you! Using your laser gun, you need to defend yourself from the onslaught of Electrosauri. The deadly creatures can come from above, the left, or the right so be sure to keep an eye on all corners of the screen! There are numerous game variations included which dictate the number of attacking creatures that can appear at a time,  their firing characteristics, and the overall difficulty level.</desc>
	<path>./Space Instigators (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>This is an unauthorized conversion of the 1978 Taito coin-op game Space Invaders for the Atari 2600. Unlike the authorized Atari Space Invaders, this version has all nine rows of invaders without flicker, rather than just six. Also, the sounds are closer to the arcade game. Gameplay is the same - shoot the rows of invaders and avoid their bullets, using your bases as shields and taking out the enemy mothership when it appears.</desc>
	<path>./Space Invaders (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>
	<path>./Space Jockey (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Space Jockey is a side scrolling shooter for one player. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by having your attack saucer shoot down the varied enemies which fly by. Tanks, jet planes, prop planes, helicopters, weather balloons, and even some trees and houses will all pass by on the screen and try to destroy your saucer. You need to make sure you avoid colliding with the various enemies and their fire or one of your three saucers will be lost. Extra saucers are awarded for each 1000 points earned. Several game variations are included which control the game difficulty, the movement abilities of the enemies, and the movement abilities of your saucer.</desc>
	<path>./Space Shuttle - A Journey Into Space (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>
	<path>./Space Treat (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>Your planet has done well but your neighbors have not so they have attacked and stolen your food. It is in a space cage. You must make your way past them to return the food to your planet.

You start at the bottom of the screen, on your base. You must push up to launch from your base, at which point you will begin consuming fuel. You must then make your way through drones that are moving left or right to the space cage at the top of the screen. When you are at the opening of the cage, where the food is, push up to retrieve it. Once you have the food, you must make your way back through the drones to your base before you run out of fuel. If you die, for whatever reason, before you return to your base with the food, you must restart the level at the bottom.

If your fuel gets too low (the indicator will turn red) your ship will actually slow down. Starting with level three, you must first grab a passkey from among the drones to open the cage and then go get the food and return.</desc>

	<path>./SpaceMaster X-7 (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are an assault ship that was designed to destroy Hyperion military bases.

You must shoot the bases enough so that the energy meter at the bottom goes from the "+" to the "-". Once the meter gets to "-" the base will explode.

Obviously, the base is not a sitting duck. There is a force field that expands and contracts, base defenders and , in higher rounds, shields. The force field has a gap in it that you can shoot through or you can maneuver inside the field and shoot the base up close. Be careful, though, because you can get caught within the field.

If you touch a shield, the force field, the base or are touched by a defender, you lose a life.

The defenders are fireballs, heat seekers, bouncers, wanderers, and homers.

The scoring is as follows:
Destroy a fireball = 25 Points
Destroy a heat seeker = 100 Points
Destroy a bouncer = 50 Points
Destroy a wanderer = 200 Points
Destroy a homer = 400 Points

You also get 25 points for each hit you get on the base.

When you destroy the first four bases, you get 1,000 points per base; the next four, 2,000 points per base and so on.

You get a bonus ship after every second base you destroy and after every 10,000 points.</desc>
	<path>./Spectracube Invasion (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Spider Fighter (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Spider Fighter is an arcade style action game somewhat similar to Space Invaders. You control a bug blaster at the bottom of the screen, and need to defend the three pieces of fruit at the top right of the screen. Various types of attacking spiders scurry around rapidly, trying to destroy your blaster and steal the fruit. If all of your fruit is stolen or you lose all of your bug blasters, the game is over. When all the spiders on a round are destroyed, you move on to the next, faster round. If you still have all three pieces of fruit when a round is completed, you receive an extra bug blaster.</desc>
	<path>./Spider-Man (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>The Green Goblin has set a super bomb at the top of a high voltage tower located on the top of a skyscaper! As Spider-Man, you need to scale the building and defuse the bomb. Use your web to climb the building, but be careful of Green Goblin's villians which appear in the windows trying to stop you. If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points. When you reach the top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.</desc>
	<path>./Spike's Peak (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Spike's Peak is an action game where you need to climb to the top of a mountain! Gameplay takes place on five different screens. The first screen shows you approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four different difficulty levels available.</desc>
	<path>./Spinning Fireball (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Spitfire Attack (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In this game, you are an American fighter pilot. Your mission is to shoot down enemy planes, shoot enemy ammo dumps (they look like little black houses) and enemy anti-aircraft guns (they kinda look like sundials). If you fly down too long, you will get a low altitude warning. If you don't correct, you will crash. You can also be shot down by anti-aircraft guns and enemy planes. Push left and right to go those directions but push up to go down and down to go up. Push the fire button to fire machine guns.</desc>
	<path>./Springer (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are Springer the rabbit. You must jump from cloud to cloud, collecting everything you can, to reach the sun.

You must jump from cloud to cloud and touch any items or eggs to collect them. If an egg hatches into a dragon, you can kick the dragon to collect him. There is a bonus timer that counts down on the screen so don't delay. Once you reach the sun at the top, then it is off to a more challenging screen.</desc>
	<path>./Sprint Master (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Sprintmaster is an action racing game similar to Super Sprint. The game is played with an overhead view of the racetrack, and the first of two players to race around the track for the required number of laps wins! Occasionally a bonus will appear in the roadway; collect these to increase the traction capabilities of your car or gain a temporary speed boost. Other obstacles, such as oil slicks, may also appear in the roadway which will cause you to lose control and speed. There is a total of nine different tracks with varying levels of difficulty to race on, and you can choose either blacktop, dirt, or ice for terrain.</desc>
	<path>./Spy Hunter (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>
	<path>./Squeeze Box (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Squeeze Box your goal is to escape from prison! To escape, you will need to blast your way through the wall on either the left or right side of the screen. Once a hole large enough to walk through is formed, you can use it to escape to the next screen. To make the game more difficult, the walls are constantly growing, and if you touch a wall you will lose a life! A second game variation is included where one wall is stationary, and the second wall grows. Your goal is to shoot all of the moving multi-colored wall blocks to turn them white. A row of blocks turns white when they all of have been destroyed; the row will then begin growing again, but you will now longer be able to shoot the blocks! When all of the rows have been changed to white, you will move on to the next level. The third (and final) game variation included is similar to the second one, except that the wall behind you will also move inwards; Your goal is still to shoot your way through the left wall before the right wall catches up to you. Each variation has two difficulty levels, the tougher difficulty has twice as many blocks as the easier.</desc>
	<path>./Squish 'Em (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>Climb up the side of a series of 48-story buildings to collect suitcases full of money, while avoiding creepy monsters and falling objects that try to knock you off. Fortunately, you can strike back against the monsters by smashing them flat, by smashing them on the head. Don't linger too long, though, since they are soon resurrected, white and unsquishable. 

Squish 'Em is similar to Crazy Climber, with much faster gameplay.</desc>
	<path>./Sssnake (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You were hunting in the Amazon when you become the hunted of prehistoric creatures. You found a fortress with a large gun. Now you must avoid the snakes that enter and exit and shoot the creatures through the holes in the fortress bricks.

The snakes will slither from one side on the screen to the other then come the opposite way one level lower. You cannot kill the snake but you can shorten it when you shoot it. Your gun runs on a gun track inside the fortress walls and always shoots away from the fortress. You cannot shoot through the bricks themselves, only in between them.

Game variations
In game one, the snakes enter the screen from one side but move fast. In game two, they enter from any side but move slower. Either way, you only have one life. Player two begins after player one by just pressing the button on the right joystick. If there is no player two or after player two dies, then you must press reset to play again.

Scoring
You score one point for shooting a prehistoric creature.
You gain no points for shooting at the bricks or shooting the snake.</desc>
	<path>./Stampede (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>It's a stampede!! Your job is to round up as many of the calves as you can. The screen scrolls to the right as you chase the calves; if more than three calves get past you, the game is over. The calves all run at different speeds, and when you rope one you earn points based on how fast it was running. As the game progresses, more and more calves will be on the screen at one time, and other obstacles will begin appearing to trip your horse and slow you down.</desc>
	<path>./Star Fire (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>This is a conversion of a 1980 Exidy coin-op game.

It is a time of crisis for the Earth forces. Years of constant assault
from the EXIDY coalition have left Earth almost totally defenseless.

Intergalactic intelligence has discovered a new threat, several Exidy
freighters, protected by an armada of smaller vessels, have entered a
friendly sector of space and are advancing on Earth itself, loaded with
enough weaponry to completely annihilate the planet.

You are Earth's only hope.

Aim your cross hair onto an enemy ship and press the button to fire. Try to shoot as many enemies as you can. Once you destroy all the enemies in a sector, a warp gate appears. Shoot it to warp to the next sector. Whenever your ship gets a direct hit from enemy fire, your shield loses energy. To restore shield energy look out for, and shoot, energy diamonds.</desc>
	<path>./Star Fox (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Star Fox is a horizontally scrolling action game. You control a starship on a foreign planet with the mission of collecting valuable crystals. The crystals will be located on the planets surface or somewhere in the atmosphere. When you locate a crystal, you need to fly down into the planets atmosphere to retrieve it (be careful, your ship has limited maneuverability while in the atmosphere). Of course, your mission won't be easy; guarding the planet are numerous enemy fighters. To protect yourself from enemy attacks your ship is equipped with lasers. The game ends when all of your ships have been destroyed. Good luck!</desc>
	<path>./Star Raiders (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all of the Krylon fighters which are closing in on your starbases! There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starships energy; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shield, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the Krylon that are visible on your galactic map have been destroyed, you win this round and can advance in rank (or even be demoted if you performed poorly on a mission).  The games difficulty will gradually increase as you rise in rank from ships cook up to captain.</desc>
	<path>./Star Ship (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Star Ship contains three different arcade action games which can be played by one or two players.

Star Ship
These game variations are played from a first person point of view in your star ship. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various enemies and space debris. You have a time limit of 2 minutes 16 seconds in the one player versions. In the two player version the time limit is 4 minutes 32 seconds; for half of this time one player will be the star ship commander, and the other will control a space module and needs to dodge the star ships fire. The roles will be reversed for the second half of the time limit.

Warp Drive
These game variations are also played from a first person point of view. Your goal here is to travel as much distance as possible while avoiding the oncoming asteroids.

Lunar Lander
These game variations are played from a third person point of view. You need to pilot your star ship and successfully land on the constantly moving moon. One point is earned for each successful landing, and asteroids and other debris may get in your way and will deduct points if you crash. In the two player versions, one player controls the star ship and the other player controls the moon.

Each of these games feature several variations which control the game speed and level of difficulty.</desc>
	<path>./Star Strike (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Star Strike was clearly inspired by the Death Star battle sequence in the movie Star Wars. You fly a space craft into the enemy launch trench. Your mission: to destroy the alien station before Earth passes directly over the launch trench. You must evade the alien ships that are defending the launch trench while being sure to bomb the red "Hot Targets". The very first red target that is missed when the Earth is directly in the middle of the launch trench becomes a missile. The missile is launched and destroys Earth.</desc>
	<path>./Star Trek - Strategic Operations Simulator (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view</desc>
	<path>./Star Voyager (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Star Voyager is an action game similar to Star Raiders. You control the space ship Star Voyager from a first person perspective; your objective is to make your way through seven star portals to save the Capital Starport, destroying enemy ships along the way. On each level there will be multiple enemies to destroy; typically they appear first in the distance, then close in slowly while firing torpedoes at you. Using the Star Voyagers weapons (either lasers or photon torpedoes) you need to destroy the enemies before they destroy you. Once a star portal appears, you need to navigate your way through to reach the next level (don't crash into the portal walls, you'll be destroyed!). In addition to the main viewport, the bottom of the screen also contains a status bar which shows the number of enemies destroyed, your energy level, and a scanner to help locate enemies.

Two player game variations are also included; in these one player controls Star Voyager, and the other player can choose to either control Star Voyagers weapons or the enemy ships.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - Jedi Arena (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Jedi Arena, you have to face an opponent in the arena to see who is the true Jedi master. Wandering throughout the arena is a seeker which is capable of firing laser bolts. To be victorious you need to destroy your opponents shield by having the seeker fire laser bolts at it. You are armed only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well as block incoming fire from your opponent. The first player to break through the other players shield wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match! Several game options are included which control the speed of the seeker, or even make the seeker invisible.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - Return of the Jedi - Death Star Battle (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>"Death Star Battle" is loosely based on the events of "Star Wars, Part 6: Return of the Jedi". Your task is to destroy the Death Star before its construction is finished. You start the task outside the shield perimeter of the Death Star. There you'll have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the energy shield. After reaching the Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the point where you can hit the core. In the following blow up of the station you must avoid collision with Death Star debris.

After successful destruction the game will restart with increased difficulty (faster enemies, faster Death Star build up, etc).

Overall difficulty can also be adjusted before starting the game.</desc>

	<desc>You're at the controls of LUKE's X-WING FIGHTER, heading straight for the DEATH STAR. Your mission: to destroy it before the EMPIRE seeks its revenge on the REBEL base. Lock your sights on attacking TIE FIGHTERS and blast them with your proton torpedoes. Race along the DEATH STAR's surface, firing on giant towers. Finally, dive full throttle into the DEATH STAR's equatorial trench. You'll need split-second timing to avoid all the obstacles as you streak through the trench in search of the main reactor. Hit it and you've blown the DEATH STAR out of existence! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back recreates a scene from the movie of the same name. You are on the icy planet of Hoth, and Imperial Walkers are closing in on the rebel power generator. As the pilot of a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!</desc>
	<path>./Stargate (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Save the humanoids from the impending aliens in the sequel to Defender. The task is still rescuing humanoids before Landers can turn them into Mutants, while avoiding and shooting other foes, however you must now carry humanoids to safety through the Stargate of the title. 

Entering this Stargate not only warps you to the nearest humanoid in jeopardy, but can also warp you ahead (while on the first 15 levels) if you enter it with 4 or more humanoids, and give you extra lives if you warp with 10 humanoids, so there is a trade-off between guaranteeing the safety of existing humanoids, and trying to advance your position

There are more enemies on screen than ever before. The Inviso button makes you invisible to enemies, but also to yourself, so you will have to follow your bullets to work out where on the screen you are.</desc>
	<path>./Stargunner (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Players take the role of a stargunner for the Yarthae Empire. The Empire is being invaded by the Sphyzygi. The stargunner must destroy their invading ships but beware of the bombs dropped by the Sphyzygi droid, Bobo.

This game is similar to Defender without the humanoids to rescue. Players must fly around the screen, shooting any incoming ships that appear. Watch out for the satellite-like object, at the top of the screen, as it drops bombs. Play simply continues from wave after wave of ships, until the player loses their last ship.</desc>
	<path>./StarMaster (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases.   In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.</desc>
	<path>./Steeplechase (Europe).a26</path>
	<desc>This is a hurdles horse race.

The horse's names, from bottom to top, are: Lucky Devil, Absent Mind, Just Missed and Little Dictator. You play as one of the jockeys and must reach the right side of the screen first. The horse runs and hurdles come at you from the right. To jump these hurdles, you turn the paddle to set the height of the jump, as indicated by the marker on the right. You press the button to jump. The better you jump, the faster your horse goes. After 3 minutes, if no one has gotten all the way to the right, the race ends and whoever was in the lead wins.

There are 6 game variations. In games 1, 2 and 3, the distance between the hurdles is uniform with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.
In games 4, 5 and 6, the the distance between the hurdles is random with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.
The difficulty switches are not used.</desc>

	<path>./Stellar Track (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>This is an Atari 2600 version of a Star Trek game found on many college mainframes.

Like those mainframe programs, it has no graphics, only text. You use the joystick, moving left or right, to select the command you want then press the red button. You then move the joystick left or right to select set the parameters of that command, if there are any. You start by pressing Reset or Select to choose how many enemies you must kill in how many stardates. 

The commands and any settings are as follows:

Galaxy Map=a 6x6 grid that starts out empty until you do a long range scan. Afterwards, the quadrants will show a 2 digit number. The left digit is the number of aliens in the area. The right digit will either be a 1 or a zero, depending on whether there is or is not a starbase in that area. Galaxy map costs you no energy or stardates.

LR Scan=Long range scan. This will tell you what is in your quadrant and all the quadrants next to yours. If there are any enemies in your quadrant when you do an LR scan, they will attack you. LR scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.

SR Scan=Short range scan. This shows you the stars, aliens and starbases in your quadrant. You need to do this to destroy aliens and dock with starbases. Like LR Scan, if there are aliens in your quadrant, they will attack after you use SR Scan. Also, like LR Scan, SR Scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.

Warp=Warp is how you move, either from quadrant to quadrant or from sector to sector within a quadrant. You move by setting 2 settings. The first is your direction. You select a direction based on the numbers below:
8 1 2

/
7--*--3
/ 

6 5 4
Next, you select how many quadrants and sectors to move. If you want to move within a quadrant, set the left number to zero so you don't warp out of that quadrant. Warp uses stardates, energy and a turn. If you warp into a quadrant that has only you and stars, the screen will be green. If you warp into a quadrant with aliens or aliens and a starbase, the screen will be red. If you warp into a quadrant with just the starbase, the screen will be gray. You cannot warp through stars. If you try, you lose the stardate and energy but don't go anywhere.

Photon Torpedo=If you hit an enemy with one of these, just one shot kills them. You select the direction with the same numbers as warp. there must be a clear line of sight between you and the enemy; no stars. You carry up to 9 torpedoes and they can be replenished. Photon torpedoes do not cost energy or time, just a turn.

Phasers=Unlike photon torpedoes, you do not need to be directly in line of the enemy or tell the game where to fire. You just set how strong you want the blast to be, via a three digit number, and the computer fires. The closer you are to the enemy, the harder you hit. Phasers use the amount of energy from you as you fired. You also use a turn.

Status=A status report. This will tell you how many stardates, aliens, energy units and photon torpedoes are left and whether you have taken damage and to what. If you have taken damage, you will see a negative number next to the damaged item. This is how many stardates it will take to repair the item on your own. You cannot leave the quadrant if your engines are damaged. Instead, you must try to warp the number of quadrants that would take that much time. You won't go anywhere but you will repair.

If you dock at a starbase, you are instantly repaired of all damage, refueled and torpedoes are restocked. Starbases are placed randomly in the galaxy and never move or get destroyed. There are always two per galaxy. To dock, warp to the quadrant and sector where the base is, so you over the top of it.

Skill (Difficulty) switches
The right switch controls how easily you take damage. In the Expert (A) position, your chance of taking damage is twice as likely as in the Novice (B) position.
The left switch controls phaser strength. In the Novice (B) position, your phasers are twice as strong as the aliens'. In the Expert (A) position, your phasers are the same strength as the aliens'.</desc>

You are a tank that must get past obstacles and avoid enemy fire to reach a base at the far end on the course. You must not delay, however, as you will run out of fuel. There are fuel depots along the course that can refill you but be warned that sometimes the enemy guns will destroy these before you can grab it.

You start with three tanks. If you run out of fuel, are shot or run into a wall or enemy gun, you lose a tank. In two player game, you alternate tanks each time you die.</desc>
	<path>./Strat-O-Gems Deluxe (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>Strat O Gems Deluxe is a falling jewels game similar to Columns, Acid Drop, Jewel Master, Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest, among others.

Three colored gems fall from the top of the screen in a vertical pattern. You must place the gems on the growing pile so that there are three or more of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When you get three or more of the same color in a row, they will disappear from the screen. If you get a combo of three or more levels, you get a high bonus. A combo is when gems disappear and cause more gems to line up and disappear. Occasionally, three gems that change colors and have colored horizontal bars across them will appear. These will create a row with whatever gems you place them on. At the end of the level, a flashing white gem with a horizontal white bar will drop down. This will remove whatever color gem it is placed on, regardless of where they are on the screen. If the gems pile up to the line at the top of the screen, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Strawberry Shortcake - Musical Match-Ups (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Strawberry Shortcake Musical Match-Ups is a puzzle game where you try to straighten out mixed up Strawberryland characters within a given time limit. When the game begins, a mixed up character will appear on the screen and you need to change the head, body, and legs until they are all from a single character. If a complete character is correctly formed, the character will perform a dance and you will hear their musical theme; if an incomplete character is formed, the musical theme heard will be partially from each of the characters you did create. Several levels of difficulty are included which dictate the time limit and which character needs to be created. In the easier levels, the character you must create will be indicated by text at the bottom of the screen. In the more difficult levels, you must create a character based on the theme song that plays.</desc>
	<path>./Street Racer (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Street Racer is an action racing game for one to four players played from an overhead view. The screen is split into two lanes; in one or two player games, each player has a lane. In three and four player games, players must share the lanes. Each game has a two minute and sixteen second time limit, and your goal is to earn as many points as possible by the end of this time. In addition to the basic racing version, several other game variations are included as well. The games available are:

Street Racer: This is the basic race car game. Points are earned by passing other cars.

Slalom: Each player controls a skier and needs to slalom through the course to earn points.

Dodgem: Each player controls a race car and needs to avoid the oncoming obstacles. One point is earned for successfully completing the race course.

Jet Shooter: Each player controls a jet in this game. Points are earned for shooting down the various oncoming planes.

Number Cruncher: Each player controls a motorcycle in this game variation. Various numbers will appear in the race track, and points are earned by running over the numbers.

Scoop Ball: Each player controls a race car with a scoop on the front. The goal is to scoop up the balls that appear in the raceway and then place them in a computer controlled car.</desc>
	<path>./Stronghold (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are sent to check out an abandoned asteroid base called Stronghold. As you approach, drones are launched from the surface. It may be abandoned but apparently the automatic defense system still works.

You must shoot or avoid the drones. If the drones are cloned, and traveling in sets, shooting any drone in the set destroys all the ones in the set, if they are destroyable (see Game variations). You can move in any direction but cannot shoot straight left or right. You can shoot in any other direction, however. After you get past the drones, three shields form near the bottom of the screen. Also, interceptor and patrol ships appear. The interceptors track you and the patrol ships just move back and forth over the shields.

You must shoot through the shields while dodging these ships so you can shoot the command crawler on the asteroid's surface. Be warned, though, that once there is a hole in the shield, the command crawler will shoot through it to destroy you. The crawler tries to stay below you but it is slow. In some game variations, the Mega-Field starts to form at the top of the screen, reducing your maneuvering room(see Game variations).

Difficulty switches
The difficulty switches determine what level you will start on.

With 8 difficulty settings there is a lot of the game to master as you must start to keep an eye on your fuel, torpedoes, radar, and enemy while avoiding depth charges as the difficulty rises.  You can fire up to two torpedoes at a time. While enemy shows go by your periscope sink as many as you can.  The periscope can turn 360 degrees and look off into the horizon or close to your sub.  Some ships move slower than others, and one of the ships moves so fast that the only way to hit it is by tracking it by radar instead of visually.</desc>

	<desc>Subterranea is a side scrolling shooter. Your goal is to locate treasure crystals within the Hexuplex Caves. Controlling your cave ranger, you need to blast the various types of aerobots which are guarding the cave. When all of the bots on a cave level have been destroyed, a passageway opens allowing you to travel deeper into the caverns. When you reach the last level of the cavern, you can collect the treasure crystal and be transported to the next (more challenging) set of caves and try for another crystal. In addition to the deadly aerobots, be sure not to crash into cave walls; these will drain your energy rapidly, especially if you hit one of the skulls. When all of your reserve cave rangers have crashed, the game is over. As you progress through the caves, they become narrower and the enemies move faster. Standard and advanced skill levels are available.</desc>
	<path>./Suicide Mission (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Suicide Mission is an arcade action game similar to Asteroids. You control a microscopic submarine navigating the bloodstream of someone who has been infected by a virus. Your goal is to destroy the virus! Each time you shoot a cell infected with the virus, it will split up into smaller pieces. Eventually the pieces will be small enough that they can be destroyed. When everything has been destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult level. The game features three levels of difficulty, and you can choose one of two shooting styles for your submarine (single torpedoes, or rapid fire).</desc>

	<path>./Super Breakout (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Super Breakout features similar gameplay to the original, but with several new game variations. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. To do this, you need to use the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the playfield. There are four different game variations included. The first is 'Breakout', and plays the same as the original game. 

This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there's room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top. 

The other two games add a second paddle. In 'Double Breakout' you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.</desc>

Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

This game is in three sections. They are called Shipwrecked, The Wilderness Island and The Secret Temple.

Shipwrecked: You begin on a raft in the water. You must make your way to the island at the top while avoiding sharks and other sea creatures. Along the way, you must collect food and water so you can survive the island. If a shark or other sea creature hits you, you will lose the raft and all supplies. If you are hit when not on a raft, you will lose your life. You can press fire to swim faster but this will cost you life points, which can get you killed.

The Wilderness Island: You make your way on the island while avoiding snakes, traps and other dangers. You must look for the temple, the key to the temple door and any other items you will need to get through the temple. Watch your food meter that it doesn't run out. Use the menu to eat food/drink water as needed. You can also switch to search mode, which allows you to place your walking stick on an item to learn what it is without getting hurt.

The Secret Temple: You make your way through the temple in first person perspective, trying to learn its secret. Sometimes you will need to find certain items to pass through magical barriers. Watch out for one-way walls and invisible transporters.</desc>

You move the target reticle by moving the joystick and fire weapons by pressing the red button. You can see the ships coming in the distance but if they get too close they will fire on you, causing you to lose energy. If you see a force field, you will see a square to the right. Shoot the square to disable the field. If your ship hits the field, you lose energy. You gain energy when you destroy a ship or disable a force field. Use the map on the top of your screen to determine which path to take, left or right. If you choose the wrong path or run out of energy, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./SWOOPS! (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>The Swoops! cartridge contains three games:

Splatform
Simply bounce to the right from platform to platform as fast as you can. Don't bounce in one place or you will lose points. Don't miss and end up below the screen or you will lose a life.

Crash 'n' Dive
As you fall down an endless tunnel, turn the paddle to hit platforms of the same color for points. You can also hit bonus platforms but beware of deadly platforms.

Cave 1k
You must press the button to make the helicopter fly up. You constantly move forward and must avoid obstacles, the cave roof and the cave floor. The farther you get, the more your points.

The fourth option, 3-athlon, allows you to play all three games in succession, with you final score being the total from all three games.</desc>
	<path>./Sword of Saros (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You have entered a wizard's dungeons in search of the fabled Sword of Saros. You must avoid the wizard, his hunter bat and other nasties while gathering treasure. Then you must escape from the dungeons.

You begin in the maze. The narrow areas are corridors and the wider areas are rooms. You must move from room to room, avoiding the wizard and his bat, gathering treasure, items and keys. Once in a room, do not stand around as each room has a monster in it that will harm you. Some rooms have doors that have either gold or a part of the sword behind them. When you find the sword piece, it will transport you to the next level of the dungeon.

In the first two levels, you will be able to see the entire maze. On the next two levels, you will reveal parts of the mazes as you explore them. On all later levels, you will only see directly around you. If a monster touches you, you will lose life points. If you encounter the wizard, you will lose life points and will need to get through his skeletons. You will start at the bottom of the screen and need to make your way to the top. In the final dungeon, all the rooms have only unlocked doors but you will need gold to bribe the monsters so you can search the doors for the exit.

The items in the maze, and their uses, are:

1. Gold: Not a selectable item. Needed to bribe monsters in the last level
2. Gems: If you collect nine gems, you can use them to get one or more type of each other item
3. Lamp: Makes it possible to see the entire maze. Not needed for mazes one or two.
4. Potion: Restores four to seven life points. You can never have more than twenty-five total life points.
5. Cross: Makes the wizard and bat move as far from you as the can
6. Scroll: Allows you to see the wizard and bat, even if they are not in a visible portion of the maze. Not needed for mazes one and two.
7. Ring: Makes you invisible to the wizard, bat and room monsters
8. Keys: Not a selectable item. Needed to open locked doors except on last dungeon. Keys do not leave the dungeon level where they are found. When you get the sword piece, any extra keys you are carrying are lost and you must find new keys.</desc>

	<path>./SwordQuest - EarthWorld (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>SwordQuest: EarthWorld was an adventure game produced for the Atari 2600. The game play boils down to walking from room to room, finding and dropping items, beating the action stages in order to find more items, and seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you if you get the right combination of items in the right rooms. 

The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.</desc>
	<path>./SwordQuest - FireWorld (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>SwordQuest: FireWorld, the second game in the SwordQuest series, was insanely identical to the first game, EarthWorld. In this installment you will find yourself walking from room to room, finding and dropping items, beating the action stages in order to find more items, seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you if you get the right combination of items in the right rooms. 

The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.</desc>
	<path>./SwordQuest - WaterWorld (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Much like the games SwordQuest: EarthWorld
and SwordQuest: FireWorld before it, SwordQuest: WaterWorld involves walking through rooms, picking up items, beating action stages to reveal more items, and seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you when you have the right items in the right rooms. 

The sets of numbers, for instance 8-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.</desc>
	<path>./Sync (USA) (Unl).a26</path>
	<desc>Sync is a collection of rhythm and puzzle games.

Mantra:
The screen will show various symbols. Move the joystick to match the sequence until the sequence completes and you receive points.

Jitter:
Much like Mantra, you must match the sequence but now, each time you match a symbol, your control moves, automatically, to the next in the sequence.

Flow:
You have to place bars around those placed by the CPU. As soon as a counter completes a given number, every CPU cell whose number of bars corresponds to the sum of adjacent bars placed by the player is removed, and points are scored.

Four:
Four has four mini-games. In Gate, you have to match symbols place by the CPU on a vertically scrolling column. In Here, you clear a cell whenever an arrow in inside each cell. Also in Four are Jitter 1K and Flow 1K, scaled down versions of their 4K cousins.</desc>

	<desc>Enemy airships are approaching your command base! You need to fly your five plane squadron into battle to defend it. Tac-Scan is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a squadron of five ships at the bottom of the screen, your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the various enemies which will be attacking. If one of the ships in your squadron is hit by enemy fire, it will be destroyed. The game ends when all five ships have been destroyed. As you progress through the game, you will occasionally have the chance to replenish missing ships. Everytime you complete a round by shooting ten enemies, an extra ship will float by on the screen. You can add this ship to your squadron by catching it in an empty space in the formation. Every time you complete four rounds, the game will advance to the next level with increased difficulty!</desc>
	<path>./Tapeworm (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>You are Slinky the tapeworm. You must move about the bean patch, eating beans. Each time you eat a bean, you grow longer and the bean count goes down by one.

Beans appear randomly in the patch and you must eat them before the beetle at the bottom get from left to right to get the count down to zero. If the beetle gets to the right before you get the bean, two more beans will appear in the patch and two more beans are added to the count.

At times, Beeky the bird or Spanky the spider will pass through the bean patch. In later levels, an obstacle will appear in the middle of the patch.

You lose a life if you touch your head (yellow square) to the obstacle or the sides of the patch, touch your head to your body, or Spanky or Beeky touch your head (eat you).

The third patch is night. When you get a bean, you can see the patch for two seconds. If you need more looks, you can press the fire button for another two seconds of light but it costs you a bean.

The levels and their point values are:
Apple (5 points per bean, 50 points for the apple)
Orange (10 points per bean, 100 points for the orange)
Grape (15 points per bean, 150 points for the grapes)
Strawberry (20 points per bean, 200 points for the strawberry)
Banana (25 points per bean, 250 points for the banana)

You get a bonus worm every 1,000 points. You can have up to 4 worms in reserve.</desc>
	<path>./Tapper (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Tapper is an action game where you're a beer tapper (barman) and have to serve beer to demanding customers. There are four customers, each has its own lane lengthier than the previous one, whom you have to keep at bay. If they reach the end of the lane without receiving their beer, you're a goner; if you miss one and accidentally spill beer needlessly you lose a life and should one of them throw you back the mug and you fail to catch it, you lose a life as well.

Occasionally a bizarre icon will appear on one of the lines and, should you grab it, will invoke a &amp;quot;cabarette&amp;quot;-style show which will keep some of the customers occupied.

The Xbox 360 version includes bonus rounds, as well as co-op and versus multiplayer modes, also online, along with achievements.</desc>

	<desc>You are John Q and you want to be rich.

In this game, you start out on the income screen where you try to collect the money (dollar signs) while avoiding the governmental red tape (look like red snakes). You have only one year to get your money and invest it. Each second, a day goes by. My, how time flies.

Once a season, you are sent to the investment/tax shelter screen, where you must collect an icon representing an investment and then grab your portfolio (briefcase). Investments have a 50/50 chance of making or losing money. Also on this screen is a character whose color changes.

What color he is determines who he is:
Black=Eggie, the IRS agent. If he catches you, he will audit you. In these audits, you always lose. You are then taxed at 50% of your income and sent back to the income screen.There are no appeals to tax court.
Pink=Waggie, the CPA. If he catches you (or you go to him), he will charge you $1,000.00 but whatever tax sheltered investment you have, he will put you in a better one.
Green=Toodles, the registered investment adviser. If you two meet, he will put you in the best tax sheltered investment available, thus making you the most profit.

After each season, you are taxed to an amount determined by your tax shelter. The object is to have $1,000,000.00 at the end of the year after taxes.</desc>

You chase the tourists with your chainsaw. When you get next to them, you press the fire button to rev up your saw and make cold-cuts out of them.

Try to avoid obstacles like hedges, fences, cow skulls and wheelchairs.
Try not to rev the chainsaw unnecessarily as you only have 3 tanks of fuel and when you're out of fuel, the game is over.

If you run into fences, cow skulls or wheelchairs, you will be delayed a moment. If you run into hedge, you will need to use the chainsaw to remove them. The chainsaw idles all the time so you don't want to be delayed.

You get 1000 points for each tourist killed. You get a new fuel tank every 5000 points. When you run out of fuel, a tourists comes up behind you and kicks you in the pants.</desc>

	<desc>This Planet Sucks! is based on the Taito coin-op game Lunar Rescue. You begin with your lander in the mothership at the top of the screen. You exit by pressing the button. You must guide your lander around asteroids to land on one of three platforms at the bottom. Be sure to press the button so you fire the retrorockets so you do not come in at too high a speed and destroy the lander. Also, take care not to hit the survivor you are going to try to rescue. Once you have your survivor, some of the asteroids change into flying saucers. You must then fly back up through these obstacles to dock with the mothership's docking area. Do not hit the left or right of it or you lose a life and the survivor you were carrying. Once all survivors are rescued, it is off to level two.</desc>

	<desc>There are six Core nuclear bases on the planet's surface. You must burrow underground to each of these bases and destroy them. But be warned, they are guarded by patrolling Core Ranger tanks that if they get you in their line of fire, will destroy you.

There are two types of tanks. The white Sentry tanks only move through existing tunnels and will only fire on you if there is clear space between you and them. The blue Digger tanks will create their own tunnels to pursue you. There is also a Sentry tank at the bottom of the screen that slowly moves towards your reserve tanks. If this tank reaches you reserves before you destroy all six bases, you lose a life. The game is over if you lose all lives.

There are enemy supplies buried in random areas that if you get them will get you bonus points. Later levels have the bases only appear one at a time or have no dirt between you and the enemy tanks, leaving them to pursue you from the start.</desc>

Tomarc is lost in a series of caves somewhere searching for his magic sword, and then must locate Senta to set her free. Deadly rats and other dangers must be avoided as you run and jump around the caves. Meanwhile, Senta must defend herself from giant bats and other creatures while trapped in the cage; although she can't move, she is capable of firing magic at enemies to destroy them. You are able to switch screens between the two characters to select which character to control.

	<path>./Tomcat - The F-14 Fighter Simulator (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>To be born with wings...

Become a F-14 Naval Aviator undergoing seek and destroy missions while dodging and gunning enemy bogeys in deadly dogfights with your 20mm cannon and air-to-air missiles.

You cockpit comes with state of the art technology, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force: Display and main computer, Bogey Alert Indicator, G-Force Indicator, Electronic Counter Measures, and a Cannon Overheat Indicator (yes, it can overheat!)...and if your feeling up to it, give the ol'bird a boost to Mach 1.0!

The gameplay like other simulation games consists of taking off, flying, combat and landing. Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision.

Taking off and landing however, also required additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise (No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try no to run over him...yet).

Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!).

After each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.</desc>
	<path>./Tooth Protectors (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In this game, you are T. P., the Tooth Protector, and are trying to protect some teeth from tooth decay by the Snack Attacks. 

Snack Attack moves across the top of the screen dropping snack food crumbs towards the teeth. You move at the bottom of the screen, just above the teeth. You must deflect the crumbs back up, hopefully hitting Snack Attack or a falling crumb for points. 

Each round is time-limited. You play until the time runs out then you get bonus points depending on weather you lost any teeth and how many. 

Occasionally, Snack Attack will try to swoop down and grab you. If you are caught, you lose a man. 

If one or more of your teeth are in danger of being lost, indicated by it flashing, you can press your fire button to Reach toothbrush, Johnson &amp; Johnson dental floss and Act fluoride dental rinse to save that/those tooth/teeth. You get three of these cleanings to start but earn bonus cleanings every 50,000 points. 

The game is over after you lose all three of your men or lose three of your teeth.</desc>

Your goal is to rescue as many survivors as possible from the many floors of the building. On each floor, your fire fighter begins at the bottom of the screen and needs to reach the top where the survivors have taken cover. Blocking your path are numerous (and dangerous) fires. Your fire fighter is equipped with a hose and an unlimited water supply to help you put out the fires. You need to be quick, however, for if you take too long the survivors will die! When you rescue as many survivors as you can and make it back out of the room, the floor is complete and a helicopter will transport you to the next floor. Although it isn't necessary to put out all of the fires on a floor, you will earn bonus points if you do. The higher you get in the building, the tougher the game becomes. Gameplay is for one or two players, and several game variations and difficulty levels are available.</desc>

	<desc>Ah, the Bahamas. Toyshop elves Patrick, Quincy, and Robert are laying on the beach, relaxing in the sun. Nothing could be finer than listening to the surf while enjoying a cold drink. A great reward for having gotten all of Santa's toys painted in record time. Unfortunately for you, Patrick's idea of "painting" toys was dumping them all in a bucket of gray paint. While this technically fulfilled his associates' obligations (thus their trip to the Bahamas), the toys--alas--still have to be painted properly.

It's now your job to clean up their mess, which means properly painting the toys in time for Santa's departure Christmas Eve. You must paint the toys as they move along five conveyor belts. Ahh, but only if it were as easy as it sounds! Toys must be painted the proper color, and some toys require two coats of paint (with different colors), and if that wasn't bad enough, some must have their coats applied in the proper order! And not that you needed the additional pressure, but you also have a daily quota to meet. You must properly paint all the toys that appear on the conveyor belts each day before the whistle at the end of your shift sounds!

Santa's counting on you to ensure that all the toys are painted correctly! Can you get the job done before Santa's sleigh is loaded up on Christmas Eve? You don't want to be responsible for children waking up Christmas morning without toys under their trees, do you? Time to juggle those cans of paint and get moving!</desc>
	<path>./Track &amp; Field (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Track &amp; Field is a sports game that allows the player to have an experience based around the Summer Olympic Games. It is based on an arcade game of the same name. Events include 100 meter dash, hammer throw, the long jump and the 110 meter hurdles.

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The NES version adds skeet shooting, triple jump, javelin throw, high jump, and archery as events but loses the hammer throw event. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If you want to go to the next event or round then you will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

During the game you use the joystick to control a cursor which aims the cue ball. By holding down the button you control the amount of power in a shot (the longer you hold down the button, the more power the cue ball is hit with). You may also apply some English by moving the joystick while hitting the cue ball. At the end of the game a trophy will appear on screen to indicate who the winner is!</desc>

Enemies will come at you three at a time, and will throw discs at you. You must keep moving to avoid them while also firing discs right back at them. There are different doors you can enter that will teleport you to another part of the room, giving you a chance to catch the enemies off guard.

There are two skill levels, and the higher your score, the harder the game becomes. Do good, and your enemies will move faster, become more accurate, and the discs will go much faster.</desc>
	<path>./Tunnel Runner (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Tunnel Runner" is an advanced 3D Maze Game, essentially what a 1st person version of Pac-Man game would be like.  Because Tunnel Runner was designed with a built-in expanded memory chip (RAM Plus!), it's 12KB of memory gives it the ability to present the maze in three dimensions.  Therefore, the playfield is a colorful, three-dimensional maze, so you never see yourself... just the walls on either side of you that form the corridors you travel along.  As you move along the passage-ways, additional tunnels appear on either side, which you can turn into by pressing left and right.

Your primary goal is to locate and collect the hidden key, located in a different spot within each maze. Through the assistance of a MAP, you can maneuver within the maze. While attempting to locate the key to exit the level, you must also avoid the hungry Zots. You will discover these enemy creatures throughout the maze. Successfully recovering the key without being intercepted by the Zot's opens the portal to the next level. As you pass each level, you will discover that the complexity and difficulty increases, while your MAP gradually reveals less and less information ultimately, your map will be of little use, requiring you to survive solely by instincts and quick thinking!</desc>
	<path>./Turmoil (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of Turmoil is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.

The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds. The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them. Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel. This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway. In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it. If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points. If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.

When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships. If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship. In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time. You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens. There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level. This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.</desc>

Be careful, for the tomb is guarded by many dangerous creatures! Cobras, bats, scorpions, and more all appear in the maze and will cause you to lose a life if you're caught! To defend yourself you are armed with a laser gun which you can fire left or right, but not up or down. In each of the mazes you are also give one "flash" which can be used to destroy all creatures currently on the screen.</desc>

	<desc>This is a home port of a 1983 Sega arcade game that was distributed by Bally Midway.

The object is to drive around a twisty course and collect all the colored flags. You can jump over gaps and over or onto other cars. If you land on another car, you kill them and collect points. You can also collect things like balloons and ice cream cones for bonus points. The faster you collect all the flags, the bigger a time bonus you get.

In later levels, there are dead-ends or gaps and a vehicle that is carrying a flag you need, so you will need to jump on him. If you are hit by another vehicle or go off the course, you lose a life. In two player games, play alternates.</desc>
	<path>./Vanguard (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Vanguard is an arcade style shooter for one or two players. Your goal is to pilot your spaceship to the City of Mystery which is located at the end of a heavily guarded tunnel, and once there destroy the creature Gond. The tunnel is broken up into several different zones, called the mountain zone, rainbow zone, stick zone, stripe zone, bleak zone, and City of Mystery. Each zone features different types of enemy spaceships to deal with, and can scroll either horizontally or vertically. In the mountain zone or stripe zone, you may also come across an energy pod marked with an 'E'. If you fly through this, your ship temporarily becomes invincible to the deadly cave walls and numerous enemies which are trying to stop you. When not invincible, your space ship is equipped with lasers to help destroy enemies. You can fire in four different directions, however your speed is decreased when firing. You also need to keep an eye on your fuel gauge; your fuel will deplete at a rapid rate, and your ship will crash if it runs out. Fuel is gained each time you destroy an enemy, so make sure you destroy as many as you can! When you finally make it through all the various zones of the tunnel and defeat Gond, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>

	<path>./Video Checkers (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In this classic game of checkers you can play with your friend or many different levels of computer AI.  Mastering all of them will take skill and strategy, as well as a bit of luck.  Video Checkers follows the standard checkers rules with the following rules: if there is a jump available, you must take it and if you get to king's row and are promoted, you cannot move again that turn but must wait for your next turn.

Game variations
Games 1 through 9 are regular checkers, from easiest to hardest in which the object is to capture or block all your opponents pieces.
Game 10 is a two player game. 
Games 11 through 19 are giveaway checkers, from easiest to hardest, in which the object of the game is to lose or be unable to move any of your pieces.

Difficulty switches

	<path>./Video Chess (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.

To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.

Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square. To carry out the en passant, you must advance your
pawn to the fifth rank. Your opponent then has the option of moving
his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two
squares. If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.

Skill levels
These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.
Level 1=15 seconds
Level 2=30 seconds
Level 3=45 seconds
Level 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds
Level 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds
Level 6=12 minutes
Level 7=10 hours
Level 8=10 seconds

Level 8 is a beginner level.</desc>

	<path>./Video Olympics (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>Video Olympics is an action game containing numerous variations of the game Pong. Two players (or one player against the computer) control paddles on the screen and attempt to prevent a bouncing ball from getting past them. In the most basic game variations, each player has a single paddle and there are no obstacles on the screen. The other game variations add paddles and obstacles, and some are loosely inspired by various sports and change the playfield around, but the goal remains the same: hit the ball past your opponents paddle into the goal to earn points. A few of these variations are:

1. Foozpong: Each player controls multiple paddles which are arranged somewhat like a foozball table.

2. Soccer pong: Each player controls two paddles (representing one goalie and one player) and the goal is much narrower.

3. Hockey pong: The playfield is set up to resemble hockey; the goal isn't at the very edge of the screen, so the ball may bounce behind and around the goal.

4. Quadrapong: The goals are located along the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the screen. This game is played by four players, two per team with one person defending each of the four goals.

5. Handball pong: There is no goal, and two players take turns hitting the ball against a solid wall to earn points. One point is earned each time your opponent is unable to return the ball.

6. Volleyball pong: The screen is set up like a volleyball court with a &amp;quot;net&amp;quot; in the middle. Both players are along the bottom of the screen and need to bounce the ball past their opponent.

7. Basketball pong: Each player controls a paddle on the bottom of the screen, and attempts to hit the ball into their opponents basket at the top.</desc>

You control a small shield which can be moved around the edge of the castle. To survive you need to use the shield to block a ball which bounces around the screen. If the ball hits your castle, it will take out some of the bricks. If a hole forms in the castle wall and the ball makes it though and hits your warlord, then you are out of the game. The last player left alive wins the battle, and the first player to win five battles wins the game! Several game options are included which allow you to either catch or ricochet the ball when the shield touches it, and control the speed of the game.</desc>

The game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>
	<path>./Word Zapper (USA).a26</path>
	<desc>In Word Zapper your goal is to zap three words in 99 seconds. First, the current word will appear at the bottom of the screen. You then have to recreate this word by controlling your spaceship and zapping letters in the correct order which will be scrolling by at the top of the screen. To make this task more challenging, various asteroids will fly by horizontally; some asteroids will cause you to lose time, others destroy your ship ending the game. To help protect yourself, your spaceship is also equipped with lasers which can be used to destroy the asteroids. If you shoot five asteroids in a row, you earn a &amp;quot;freebie&amp;quot; which can be used in place of any letter. You will also need to use the &amp;quot;freebie&amp;quot; to move on to the next word after all the necessary letters have been zapped. The game ends when you successfully zap three words, the time limit runs out, or your spaceship is destroyed by asteroids. Numerous game variations are available. These control the speed and density of the asteroids, the speed of the scrolling alphabet, and allow you to choose between zapping words or random letters.</desc>

The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</desc>

	<desc>The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. 

The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.

For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.</desc>

2. Level 2: The Kingdom is larger than Level 1, containing secret rooms and hidden items to add difficulty.
3. Level 3 (Hardest): Similar to Level 2 but all objects/items are placed randomly throughout the Kingdom.

Gameplay revolves around picking up (and dropping) items, hacking your way though dragons, finding keys to open the castle gates and using magic (i.e. reincarnation) in case you get swallowed by failing-to-follow-their-diet-plan-dragons.</desc>
	<path>./Adventures of TRON (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Adventures of Tron is based on the motion picture TRON from Walt Disney Productions.

The game environment consists of 4 floors, each with flying "bits" as well as enemy MCP attackers. The objective of the game is to control TRON (you) in a maze of platforms and elevators while trying to intercept the flying bits (intercepting bits on higher floors are awarded higher points).

Dodge enemy MCP attackers by jumping, using elevators and hitching a ride on the Silver Sailor. Capturing all 7 "bits" will take you to the next level, with added speed and difficulty.

You have a total of 4 lives in play. Make each one count!</desc>
	<path>./Air Raid (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen.

There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends.

The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much damage that they collapse.

There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of these.</desc>
	<path>./Air Raiders (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Goal of the game is to shoot as many enemies as possible (only visible from the side) while avoiding being shot down by flak cannons (which can cause a drop by up to 15 altitude) and to land safely again before the fuel runs out. If more than ten enemies have been shot it is possible to take off again with an ammo equal to the number of enemies being hit.</desc>
	<path>./Airlock (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>The player is trapped in a crashed nuclear submarine which has begun taking on water. They need to escape by making their way up the levels of the submarine one at a time. Each floor has two hatch keys that need to be collected in order to unlock the elevator to the next level. There is a time limit, though; if you take too long the floor will flood and you'll be unable to escape. Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes. The player will need to jump over any torpedoes that cross their path, or they will be stunned momentarily and lose precious time.</desc>
	<path>./Air-Sea Battle (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game.  On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen.  The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.

In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft. You are stationary. Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile. 

In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above. On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen. Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above. Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired.

In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again. This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits). The controls are as in games 1-6. 

In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above. Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed. When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired. 

In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below. The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18. The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below. 

In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.

Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds. (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets. I have yet to see this happen.) In each of the single player games, the single player tries to outscore a computer opponent that simply constantly fires.</desc>
	<path>./Alfred Challenge (France) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>As Alfred, you must run, jump and climb ladders to reach keys to open the doors to get to the next level. Watch out for Tazniak and the Bukoï as they are out to kill you. Do not dally, as you have a limited time to complete a screen. There are three screens and a hidden screen.</desc>
	<path>./Alien (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In this game based, loosely, on the movie of the same name, you have to move through a maze (the halls of your ship in the manual), ala Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs). 

If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot (pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.

After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.</desc>

	<desc>As waves of aliens attack, you must kill them all before you are killed yourself. There are eight different aliens, each with different moves and attacks. Your ship is at the bottom middle of the screen. You do not move. Instead, when you push left or right, the enemies shift to that side.</desc>
	<path>./Alligator People, The (USA) (Proto).rom</path>
	<desc>This game is based on a 1959 20th Century Fox horror/sci-fi movie of the same name. You are Jane Marvin. Your finance and five of your friends are turning into alligators due to a failed medical experiment. You must get the alligator antidote to cure them.

You, as a syringe, must move about the screen, gathering antidotes and serums. Serums supposedly increase the strength of the antidote so you need less to cure someone. You must then aim at the infected person at the top or bottom of the screen and press your button to inject them. The longer you take to get the antidote to them, the more they will mutate and the more antidote it will require to cure them. Everything is not so simple, however, as there are normal alligators in the swamp and you will lose you a life if they touch you. You can shoot to kill them and it will not cost you an antidote.

Some variations have walls that move. These make it harder to see the alligators, antidotes and serums. Serums only appear in variations with walls. Some variations allow you to pass through the walls, others will make the walls solid and they can crush you if you get between two closing ones. Once you cure all six friends, it is off to the next level.</desc>
	<path>./Alpha Beam with Ernie (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Ernie's ship has run out of fuel and it is up to you to help him.

Use the buttons of the controller to move your ship left or right and beam letters to the correct slots on Ernie's ship. Once all the letters are in place, Ernie can fly away.

This game helps kids learn to recognize letters and match capital letters to lower case and recognize easy-to-confuse letters.

The game manual also contained a read-aloud story.

	<path>./Artillery Duel (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In this two player game each player controls an artillery gun set in a mountain landscape with the goal of destroying the other player. Players take turns firing at each other; on each turn you have a limited amount of time in which the barrel angle and powder level can be set in order to control the direction and distance of the shot. When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of time you have to make a shot.</desc>
	<path>./AStar (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>Inspired by a calculator game called DStar, collect all the items on the screen in the fewest moves. Your character can only move in one direction until he hits something then he can change directions. If you collect all items on each screen without exceeding the minimum moves required, you win the game. If you exceed the minimum moves for your screen, a tone will sound and the score area will change color. You will not be stopped but you will not have been counted as won.</desc>

	<path>./Asteroid Fire (Europe).rom</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Asteroids (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name.

Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon. When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.

The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.

Game Difficulty and Variations
There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 

The game also offers three different game variations:

1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.

2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.

3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.

Scoring
The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.

1. Small saucer - 1,000 points
2. Other player's ship - 500 points
3. Large saucer - 200 points
4. Small asteroid - 100 points
5. Medium asteroid - 50 points
6. Large asteroid - 20 points</desc>

	<path>./Atari Video Cube (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In this game, you control Marvin the Cube Master. You move him around a six-sided cube with nine squares to a side.
The object is to get all nine sides to be one color each in the least amount of time or fewest moves, depending on the game variation you select.

Marvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire button. Marvin will then exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot move onto a space of the same color as he is.

To rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the direction to rotate.

The game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest moves.
Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it rotates, so you don't know what color your on.
Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict you rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces.

Eight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.</desc>
	<path>./A-Team, The (USA) (Proto).rom</path>
	<desc>If The A-Team looks familiar it's because it is little more than a graphic hack of another unreleased Atari game called Saboteur.  At one point it was thought these games were the same except for the graphics, but after analyzing them I've found some slight gameplay differences.  On this page I'll concentrate on the differences between Saboteur and The A-Team, for more information on the gameplay itself look at the Saboteur page.  

It's unknown why Atari decided to change Saboteur into The A-Team, but we assume it's because they wanted a game based on the then popular A-Team TV show and didn't want to wait for a new game to be developed. At that point Saboteur was ready for release and Atari decided that they would attempt to integrate A-Team characters into a game that was already finished. The results are interesting at best, confusing to say the least.</desc>

	<desc>The lost city of Atlantis is under attack! Wave after wave of Gorgon vessels are approaching, each armed with weapons capable of destroying a part of the city. You are in charge of the command posts at the edges of the city and need to defend it from the invaders. The various gorgon craft will keep flying by on the screen in varying numbers and in different flight patterns. At first they fly high in the sky but then progressively lower. If an enemy makes it low enough before you destroy it, it will use it's weapons and destroy one of the buildings in Atlantis. As you progress in the game, the enemy craft will keep increasing in speed. The game ends when all remaining buildings in the city have been destroyed.</desc>

On the first screen, you are running the Gauntlet. Your character runs towards the horizon, from which a pyramid arises as you go, while spears shoot from left or right. You must jump or duck the spears by pushing up or down on the joystick.

After you clear the Gauntlet, you must run up the Stairs of the pyramid while the priests throw stones down at you. You must push left or right to avoid these stones hitting you.

Using the left difficulty switch, you can select to play one level after another of the Gauntlet or play level one of Gauntlet followed by level one of Stairs then level two and so on. The right difficulty switch selects music or sounds.</desc>

	<path>./Backfire (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>The year is 2947. Earth is being invaded by the evil Kcaj clan from the Yenrut galaxy. You are Galactic Commander Frank Drexor. The United States Space Guard has commissioned you with the task of defending the most important sector of the galaxy from the invaders. Kcaj technology is much more advanced than the technology of Earth. Some of the ships have tractor beams. Others are equipped with subspace energy disruptors. These disruptors create energy barriers that will actually cause the shots from your cannons to reflect back at you! If your mission is a failure, the Kcaj will gain control of this vital sector of space, allowing them to maneuver their troops and equipment much more efficiently and gain a larger foothold in the battle for the planet. This would certainly spell disaster for the citizens of Earth. Their fate is in your hands! 

You have a gun on the top of the screen and one on the bottom, each of which travel left or right. To switch between weapons, just press the joystick up or down. You must be careful when you fire because if you shoot your own gun, you will lose a life. There is a yellow spaceship that starts on the row next to the middle row and moves across the screen. Each time it reaches the screen, it moves one row closer to one side. If it gets to your gun, you lose as life. Later in the game, barriers appear in the playing field. You must be careful when these are there as they will reflect your gun's shots back, losing you a life if they hit. In the center, at times, there is a UFO colored either red, blue or green. The red is worth one-hundred points, the blue grants and extra life and the green resets the difficulty to level one without removing the points. Play simply continues until you lose all your lives.</desc>
	<path>./Backgammon (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in this manual.

Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:
All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.
No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.
A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.
After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.
If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.

Difficulty switches
Right:
A=computer rolls dice for you
B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers
Left:
A=computer sets up the board for you
B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

	<path>./Bank Heist (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You are a bank robber, driving around a maze of streets (representing the city) in a 1930's style car.  Your purpose is clear: perform "bank heists" by driving across white-pillared symbols that represent banks.  As you "rob" each of the banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its place, beginning hot pursuit after a few moments.  You must avoid the cops to stay alive.  Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite, which you can strategically drop to destroy the cop cars.

Besides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to another (as in Pac-Man), there is an additional tunnel that represents the road out of town. By taking it, you will find yourself in the next city. Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and smarter.

There are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one. Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to town, navigating the mazes of streets, and robbing as many of the banks in each town as you are able to. This keeps your gas supply high, and the money rolling in! If you run out of gas, the game is over.</desc>

	<desc>In Barnstorming, you are the pilot of a biplane. Your point of view is from the side as the screen scrolls by horizontally. Your goal is to fly through a set number of barns in the shortest amount of time possible. Several obstacles will appear in your way, including flocks of geese, windmills, and weather vanes. Crashing into any of these will cause you to lose speed which will increase your overall time. There are several difficulty levels included which will require that you fly through anywhere from 10 to 25 barns.</desc>

Each game of Basic Math gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a function, and inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is available to ramp up the difficulty. The game has eight primary game settings - basically two settings for each mathematical function. Games 1 - 4 allow you to select one of the numbers you will be working with, while 5 - 8 give random questions. 

Hint: For division problems that have a remainder make sure to put a space between the whole number and the remainder, which goes to the right.</desc>

Using the joystick you can move your player around the court, dribble/shoot the ball, and attempt to block your opponent. The game is played in two 4 minute halves, and the player who scores the most points wins. There are two different skill levels available which can be set individually for each player.</desc>

	<desc>Atari Games' 3D tank game was ground-breaking when released to the arcades, and as such was converted officially to many systems. Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.</desc>

	<desc>Beamrider is a 3-D arcade action game. You control a beam riding spaceship on a mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occassionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</desc>

The object is to stun then capture Beannies. You can also capture Bouncing Orange Eyeballs and various Falling Objects.

If an unstunned Beanny touches you, you lose a life. You don't need to stun the other items to capture them but doing so makes them slow down.

You get a bonus Bopper by shooting four Beannies in a row without losing a Bopper.

There are two game options, one where the Beannies bounce off the walls on screen, the other where they pass through.</desc>

Then you will be in the forest, where, depending on the cassette you have selected, you will have to catch the correct numbers, letters or the letters to spell a certain word.

After you catch the required items, you then move on and either have to dodge stones again or cross one or two bridges that open and close.

If you hit a stone, catch the wrong falling item or don't get across the bridge(s) in time, you get a warning sound but do not lose a life. You can play non-stop until you choose to stop.</desc>

Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by collecting treasures and destroying the various enemies you'll encounter. Your mini-sub is equipped with a tractor beam which can be used to collect treasures found along the bottom of the ocean; when you successfully retrieve a treasure, you will then need to carry it safely up to the research vessel on the surface. Your mini-sub is also equipped with lasers which can be used to destroy the many dangers you'll encounter, including giant squids, man-eating sharks, mines, bombs, enemy ships, and more. The game ends when all of your mini-subs have been destroyed, and there are multiple skill levels available.</desc>

	<desc>Big Bird wants to win the county fair egg contest and you can help him.

A chicken at the top will lay and egg and it will go down a chute. You must get Big Bird under the correct chute to catch the egg.

Game one is one player only. Games two through ten are one or two player. All games have two rounds.

Game one is a practice round. There are two chickens, straight chutes and when you move Big Bird left or right, he pops right under the chute.

Games two and three have three then four chutes and the game gets faster in the second round. Game two's chutes are straight, game three's zig-zag. Big Bird still pops under a chute.

Games four, five and six have three rounds. There will be eleven white eggs dropped and one golden egg. Games four starts with two zig-zagging chutes in the first round and four in the second. Game five has two crisscrossing chutes in the first round, four in the second. Game six has four crisscrossing chutes in both rounds. Big Bird no longer pops under the chute but must be positioned correctly.

Games seven has eleven white eggs and one golden egg dropping per round with unlimited rounds. There are five broken eggs on the bottom left and you do rounds until you miss so many eggs you are out of broken eggs. when you catch the golden egg, in addition to points, you get an extra broken egg.

Game eight is the same as game seven except you can't see an egg in the chute, only when it pops out the bottom.

Games nine and ten are the same as game seven but the chutes shrink up in the direction of the hens. This means you must memorize when the chute comes out for which chicken. In game nine, the chutes are all the same for each round. In game ten, the patterns change per round.

Each white egg caught is worth one point, each golden egg, five.

	<desc>Blackjack is based on the casino card game of the same name. You can play alone or with up to 2 other players against the computer that takes the role of the dealer. 

The game follows the same basic rules as its casino counterpart. Each player starts the game with 200 chips and each can bet from 1 to 25 chips to get a hand. A player breaks the bank when he reaches 1000 chips and loses when he has no more chips to bet. In both cases, he is removed from the game. At any time, a player may quit or resume the game by using the game select switch. A player who went broke or who reached 1000 chips may also stay on the game using the same switch. He will then start with 200 chips.</desc>

Freeway originally featured people crossing the road instead of chickens since that was the scenario that inspired David Crane. However some people at Activision complained that they didn't like the idea of people being struck by cars, so chickens were substituted for people before the game was released.</desc>

	<desc>Your girlfriend Daisy is in trouble! Ollie Org is chasing her across the top of the screen, and you need to come to the rescue. To stop Ollie before time runs out, you need to construct a machine. The blue print for the machine is at the bottom of the screen, so all you need to do is locate the parts which are hidden in the numerous houses in a maze like town. When you locate a part, drag it back and place it on the blue print. When all parts have been located, press the start button and the machine is ready to go! To make your task more difficult, there are several obstacles that get in the way. If you enter a house which doesn't contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a bomb. You will need to hurry and diffuse any bombs in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to time, a flower pot will fall from above and then hop off the screen. Get hit by a flower pot, and you lose a life. You also need to be careful of Fuzzy Wuzzy, who wanders around the neighborhood randomly. An encounter with Fuzzy Wuzzy will also be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete; while he isn't deadly, he will occasionally appear and press the start button before your machine is complete. If this happens, you will need to drag Pete back to the bomb pit and reassemble all of the machine parts.</desc>

	<path>./Boing! (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>This is a game rather reminiscent of Q*bert.

In this game, you are a bubble named, with great originality, Bubble.
The object here is to bounce on each of the thirty-six squares and turn them all on. You start at the bottom left. On the bottom right starts the Bubble Eater. He will chase you around the play field and if he catches you, you lose one of your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost.

The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is popped, it turns into a glowing puddle for a short time. While it is a puddle, you can bounce on it without getting hurt.

Game variations
The game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three.

Levels
There are 5 waves per level.
Level 1: The Bubble can bounce on any square and it will turn on and stay on.
Level 2: The same as level 1 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.
Level 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce on it again it turns off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on again.
Level 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.

Scoring
You get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave.
You score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points even if you are turning on a step a repeatedly.
You get points for completing a level and/or wave. The amount varies by what level or wave you completed.</desc>

The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:

1. One Player
Two Player Alternating
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.

This is accomplished by moving your pieces diagonally forward on the board; an opponents piece is removed from play if one of your pieces jumps over it (if any of your pieces are able to jump an opponents piece, you must make that move). When beginning the game pieces can only move in a diagonal forward direction until they reach the other side of the board; that piece then becomes &amp;quot;kinged&amp;quot; allowing movement both forwards and backwards. The game can be played by one player against the computer (with three skill levels available) or two players against each other.</desc>

	<path>./China Syndrome (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>The Spectra Island reactor provides power for millions of residents. Ordinarily, there is no problem but there has been an earthquake. This has damaged the reactor, causing it to release radioactive particles. You must use the robot arm to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too much and we have a meltdown.

There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red, blue and yellow. You start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm.

If you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.</desc>
	<path>./Chopper Command (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Chopper Command is a side scrolling shooter. As the pilot of a helicopter gunship, your mission is to protect the convoy of trucks which is travelling at the bottom of the screen. Each wave consists of numerous enemy choppers and jets which are trying to destroy you and the convoy. When all enemies in the current wave are destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult wave. To help out, a long range scanner is located at the bottom of the screen which can locate trucks in the convoy as well as enemy aircraft. Good luck, the ground troops are counting on you!</desc>
	<path>./Chuck Norris Superkicks (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In this action game you play the part of Chuck Norris on a quest to reach a monastery where an important leader is kept hostage. The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.</desc>

	<desc>Pop the balloons and score points. A wall of red, blue and white balloons will appear at the top of the screen. You must pop balloons by catching a clown on the teeter-totter and bouncing him up to the balloons. Use the controller to move the teeter-totter across the screen to catch the clowns. Each time a clown pops a balloon, the balloon will disappear and you score points. Each player receives five clowns or turns. If you fail to catch a clown on the teeter-totter he will crash and disappear from the playfield. Press the controller button and another clown will bounce off the trampoline from the right or left corner of the playfield. After five clowns have crashed the game is over. The clowns may land on any point on the teeter-totter except where the other clown is sitting, which causes them to crash.</desc>

	<desc>In CocoNuts Stanley the intrepid jungle explorer is under attack from Coco the monkey! Coco is up in the trees throwing coconuts at Stanley. You control Stanley and need to dodge the incoming coconuts. You begin the game equipped with a helmet and an umbrella to protect yourself. Each time you are hit by a coconut, you lose one of these items. You may also regain an item by scoring enough points. The game ends when you have nothing left to protect yourself and a coconut hits you. Of course, the longer you can last in the game, the faster it becomes!

	<path>./Codebreaker (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In Codebreaker your goal is to guess a 3 or 4 digit secret code which is generated by either the computer or another player. Depending on the difficulty setting, the player has either 8 or 12 guesses to figure out the code by entering in values with the keyboard controller. After each guess, the computer analyzes your input and displays results which indicate if you have a correct digit in the correct position, a correct digit in the wrong position, or no correct digits at all. Points are scored based on how many turns it takes to correctly identify the code. A second game variation called Nim is also included. In this game, two players take turns removing items from a stack. On each turn, a player must take at least one item from a stack, and the player who removes the last item from the screen wins. You can have the computer set up the stacks automatically or set them up manually, and a variation is included where the player who removes the last item from the screen loses rather than wins.

	<desc>Mayday! Mayday! This is Colony 7! We are under attack by the Jarvians! Defensive shield has been raised. We will do what we can to survive.

This is an Atari 2600 port of a 1981 Taito arcade game. The Jarvian have attacked. You must defend Colony 7. You are manning the defensive guns that defend the colony. The Jarvians will send wave after wave to try to break through the colony's defense shield and/or destroy the defense cannons. The defense laser fires non-stop so you just need to use the joystick to place the cross hair over an enemy to kill them. If the enemies get to be too much, press fire to activate the Mega Blaster and destroy all the enemies on the screen.. Be advised that you only have three shots for the Mega Blaster. If the colony or cannons are destroyed, the game is over.

The Jarvian ships are:

1. The Fighter: This is the most common and several attack at once, firing at the shield and colony and, sometimes, your cannon.

2. The Advisor: This will cause the Fighters to target faster so remove it as soon as you can.

3. The Bomber: This one will not target the shield but will try to bomb your cannon. Shoot it and/or it's bombs before they reach their target.

4. The Scout: This one will call in replacement ships so see to it that he doesn't stay long.</desc>

	<path>./Combat Two (USA) (Proto).rom</path>
	<desc>The year is 2037. Nations no longer fight monster wars, killing millions. Instead, two combatants enter an arena and fight for their countries honor.

This is a sequel to the 1977 game Combat however, there are no planes, just tanks and missiles. Each player starts in a base in a corner, one in the upper left, the other in the lower right. You must seek out your opponent and shoot them three times to destroy their tank. If they are under trees or, in another game variation, behind walls, you must shoot the trees/walls out of the way first to reach them. Each player has three tanks. The winner is the last one standing.

If you are still in your base, you can press the button to fire a homing missile that will seek out you opponent. When the homing missile hits, it counts as two shots. Missiles must reload between shots and the reloading time is several seconds. If a tank is not hit for several seconds, the 'crew' will affect repairs.

There are game variations for trees, which you can drive but not shoot through, walls, which you can neither drive nor shoot through and versions where you can place the trees/walls where you would like them to be.</desc>
	<path>./Commando (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Several levels await your super-tough Commando in this arcade conversion. Armed with only a standard rifle and a few grenades you must take on hordes of Nazis. Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill form distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.</desc>
	<path>./Commando Raid (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Your city is under attack by commando raiders, and it's your job to defend it! You control a large gun at the bottom of the screen. Choppers will be flying in paratroopers, both of which need to be destroyed. If a paratrooper makes it past your fire and lands, it will damage and eventually destroy one of the buildings in the city. After a building is destroyed, the paratroopers will then begin tunneling towards your gun in an effort to destroy it. Occasionally an airplane will fly by and drop a large bomb. The bomb needs to be shot before it lands, or it can destroy the entire city! The game ends when your gun is destroyed by a bomb or a paratrooper.</desc>
	<path>./Communist Mutants from Space (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Communist Mutants From Space is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. Your goal is to defend your home planet from the various mutant warriors which are attacking. You control an anti-mutant canon on the bottom of the screen, and need to shoot as many of the mutants at the top as you can. At the very top of the screen a Mother Creature will be creating mutant eggs that fall into the formation. The eggs will slowly hatch into various creatures which fly down and try to bomb or crash into your canon. If you destroy the Mother Creature as well as all of the mutants on the screen, you will move on to the next, more difficult level. Several game options are included which allow you to enable or disable a shield, guided fire, a time warp to temporarily slow down the game, and penetrating fire allowing you to take out several mutants with one shot.</desc>

	<desc>Cookie Monster hungry! Want cookie!

You are moving around a maze, collecting cookies and bringing them back to a cookie jar.

Games one through three are one player, games four through ten are one or two player.

In games one, two and three, you move Cookie Monster around the maze, get the cookies and return them to the cookie jar, one at a time. Between mazes, Cookie Monster eats each cookie, one at a time. There are three mazes per game. In game one, there are one, two then three cookies. In game two, four, five then six and in game three, seven, eight the nine.

Games four through six are timed. You can carry multiple cookies and keep playing mazes until time runs out. In games four, five and six, you have five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Games seven through nine are also timed but now you play as the Cookie Kid. You are trying to collect cookies for a surprise party for Cookie Monster. Since he hasn't been told this, he is pacing back and forth on the other side on the fence. Each time you pick up a cookie, Cookie Monster jumps over the fence and chases you. He will each and cookies of the path he is coming down and if he catches you, he will eat all the cookies you are carrying. The times for games seven, eight and nine are five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Game ten in the same as game nine (three minute time limit, you are Cookie Kid and chased by Cookie Monster) except the maze is invisible. When you pick up a cookie, the maze flashes for a second so you can figure out the fastest route to take.

You get one point per cookie in the jar.

	<path>./Cosmic Ark (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>The Alpha Ro solar system is in crisis! Their sun is about to go supernova, meaning the death of all the many planets and the exotic lifeforms who call them home. Luckily, though, the noble Atlanteans have heard of Alpha Ro's plight and have sent a vast Cosmic Ark thousands of light-years across the galaxy to try and save as many species as possible. As the captain of the Ark, the player will have to contend with deadly meteor storms and planetary defense systems to succeed the mission.

Cosmic Ark features two play screens: On the first, the player will have to blast meteors with four-way cannons. Blast enough and the player can go on to the second screen. The Ark descends low over one of Alpha Ro's planets. The player will then have to guide a shuttle craft down and beam aboard two creatures, while avoiding any laser defense system that may be in operation. The player will have to get the creatures back on board quickly, because another meteor shower could happen at any moment. Then it's off to the next planet!</desc>
	<path>./Cosmic Commuter (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Cosmic Commuter takes place in the year 2075. You work for the Galactic Travel Agency, and need to help the citizens commute to and from work! Each level consists of several parts. First, you must successfully land the rocket module on the planet surface (this contains your astrobus). This part of the game is similar to the game Lunar Lander; you must control the speed of the lander to make sure you don't crash! In the second, horizontally scrolling segment you control the astrobus and attempt to pick up the commuters at the bus stops. Once all of the commuters are picked up, return to the rocket module and take off to transport the commuters to the grand central space station. Of course, there are many obstacles which can prevent a successful mission. Meteors, fireballs and space mines all get in the way and can destroy your astrobus. Your astrobus is equipped with a laser that can be used to destroy these obstacles. The astrobus also has a limited amount of fuel; if you start running out you better find more fuel before you crash!</desc>
	<path>./Cosmic Creeps (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Civilization is doomed! You are our last hope! You must protect the Cosmic Kids from the Cosmic Creeps as they escape the orbit-decaying planet!

The first part of the game is The Voyage. You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay a little more

The second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.

If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety. You need to score 5000 points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you will start the Voyage again, only faster.</desc>

	<desc>You are at the Waypoint Interstellar Trade Depot, a quiet outpost in space, when suddenly a dormant group of alien, mineral-eating termites awakens. They then begin haphazardly making their nest.

Using your probe ship, you must destroy the termites and their nest blocks. You simply fire at the termites to destroy them but their nest blocks must be energized before you can destroy them. To energize a nest block, you must hit a block while a termite is still carrying it. This will energize all the blocks on the screen.

If you shoot a termite that is not carrying a block or if one is carrying a block but you only hit the termite, all the blocks will not be energized and not be damageable. If you run into a block, energized or not, or are touched by a termite, you lose a life.

Every so often, a refuel ship travels down and then back up the left or right side of the screen. You must dock with it (touch it) before it gets back to the top or the game ends, no matter how many lives you have left.

To fire, press the fire button. To move, move the joystick while the button is not pressed. If you hold down the button, you can rotate left or right then you will stay at that angle until you rotate again.

The points are:
Shooting a termite that is NOT carrying a block=1 point
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block but only hitting the termite=2 points
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block and hitting the block=3 points
Shooting an energized block=1 point</desc>

	<desc>As a professional ornithologist, you're thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills have nested in your "old yolk tree." But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.

You get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site.</desc>

	<desc>A barrage of bugs are attacking your home, and you need to defend it with potted plants! You control your character at the top of the screen where there are six potted plants. These can be dropped on the bugs to destroy them as they make their way up from the sewer at the bottom. Just beneath the potted plants are six windows; you need to make sure you destroy the bugs before they can reach these windows. If six of the bugs make it into the windows, a layer of your house will be eaten. This will drop you one step closer to the bottom of the screen, making it more difficult to destroy the incoming bugs! The game ends when six layers of the building have been eaten. There are four different color bugs in the game, each of which have a different pattern of movement. As the levels progress, bugs will keep coming faster and faster!</desc>

	<desc>The object of this game is to use your flying sub, the Sea Hunter,  to destroy enemies and get treasures.

You move fastest when in the air, half speed when in the water and cannot move forward when on the sea bottom.

Your enemies and their point values are:
Plane = 300
Helicopter = 100
Bird = 0
Boat = 50
Sting Ray = 20
Shark = 100
Angler Fish = 200

You get 1 point for stunning the sea monster but cannot kill him. You cannot do anything with mines but avoid them.

The possible treasures and their point values are:
Sword = 200
Wine Bottle = 400
Sunken Boat = 500
Crown = 1000
Chalice = 2000
Pot of Gold = 3000

You cannot take all day because you are timed, as well. To make matters worse, in the later levels, you face moving spikes, Hurricane Man, who will try to blow you into a wall, and magnets that try to drag you into the wall. There are sixteen levels total.</desc>

	<desc>As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.

The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects, another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 

Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.</desc>

Use a joystick to take items, talk to characters and go places to find the king's rose.
Inspired by text-based games like those released by Infocom, you do not type here. Instead, you move the joystick to change the selection at the bottom of the screen then press the button to select.</desc>
	<path>./Deadly Duck (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You are Deadly Duck and the object is to shoot your bill bullets at crabs, the bricks they drop and dragonflies.

Each level starts with eight crabs. The crabs grab bricks from the sides and try to drop them on you. You can shoot the bricks as they fall and the crabs but if a brick lands on you, you're a dead duck.
When a brick lands, it will stay on the pond for a moment, blocking you from moving horizontally.

On levels two to four, you have two, four and six dragonflies, respectively, moving together just under the crabs. You get ten points for shooting the dragonflies but this makes them angry. They then drop one, two or three bombs (depending on the level). If you are next to a bomb when it explodes, your goose is cooked.

The game continues until you lose all you ducks.

It's all enough to make you quack up.</desc>
	<path>./Death Trap (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You have been sent to deliver a message. Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.

IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)

You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.

As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).

After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.

You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.

Game variations
After you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.

The difficulty settings are:
Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.
Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.
Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.

The difficulty switches are not used.
After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.

Scoring
Readiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.
Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.
Destroy the left or right generator=2000 points
Destroy the center generator=5000 points
Shield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than zero.</desc>
	<path>./Defender (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Defender put players in charge of a ship sent to protect mankind from wave after wave of attacking alien forces.

Armed with "smart bombs", and the ability to use hyperspace to move quickly around the planet, the player ship must fight against Bombers, Pods, Swarmers, Baiters, and Landers - that can capture the humanoids and transform them into deadly and relentless Mutants. Fail to save the humanoids from freefall or Mutant transformation, and the planet is destroyed.

Eugene Jarvis' Defender has been widely regarded as one of the most popular and addictive space shooters of the early 1980's</desc>
	<path>./Demolition Herby (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Wham! Bam! Watch out, ma'am!

You are Demolition Herby and you're out to own the roads. You must drive around a square section to black it out; the object being to black out all sections. There are only three things in your way: the chase cars. When they drive over a line you have turned red, it turns white again. To make matters worse, they will try to ram you off the track. The good news is if you ram them from behind, you run them off the track for a few seconds. If you need a burst of speed, shift into overdrive by pressing your button however, there is a drawback, as I will explain. Something else to keep an eye on is your fuel. You burn fuel as your drive and burn faster when you use overdrive. Each time you black out an section, you gain points and fuel. If you black out two sections at once, you gain more fuel. You will lose a life if you run out of fuel or are knocked off the track. If you lose three lives, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Demon Attack (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</desc>
	<path>./Demons to Diamonds (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In Demons to Diamonds, you control a laser zapper which moves horizontally at either the top or the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting objects in the center of the screen. Wandering back and forth in the middle are demons which can be one of two colors. If you shoot a demon that is the same color as your zapper, it will turn into a diamond. Shooting the diamond before it disappears will earn you bonus points. If you shoot a demon of the opposite color, it will instead turn into a skull which will rapidly fire at your zapper. You begin the game with five zappers, and the game ends when all five have been destroyed by skulls. The game can be played by one or two players, and several game variations are included to set the level of difficulty.</desc>
	<path>./Desert Falcon (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Desert Falcon is an arcade style shooter. Many of the Pharaoh's great treasures are lost throughout the desert, and your goal is to steal as many as you can to earn points. The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</desc>
	<path>./Dice Puzzle (Europe).rom</path>
	<desc>If you enjoy games like Rubik's Cube, then you'll like this one. The object of Dice Puzzle is to get all 16 dice to show the same number. You accomplish this by clicking on a column or row, which advances all of the numbers in that column or row by one (of course six advances to one). See how quickly (or in how many moves) you can do it.</desc>
	<path>./Dig Dug (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>
	<path>./Dodge 'Em (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You control a race car on a four lane track, and your goal is to collect all of the dots in order to earn points and advance to the next level! The race track is broken up into four quadrants; your racecar must remain in the lane it is in except where there is a break in the lanes between quadrants. Trying to stop you is a second car which travels in the opposite direction. This car will always be trying to get into the same lane as you, causing a crash, so you need to make sure you switch to any lane it isn't in! To help out, your racecar has the ability to travel at a fast or slow speed. You begin the game with three racecars, and the game ends when all three cars have crashed. A two player game variation is also available where one player controls a car trying to collect the dots, and the second player controls the crash car trying to stop the first player.</desc>
	<path>./Dolphin (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Dolphin is a side scrolling action game. You control a dolphin that is being chased by a giant sea squid. Your goal is to earn points by staying alive as long as possible. As you swim away from the squid, you will encounter schools of sea horses which form a vertical row on the screen with only a small opening to swim through. As you approach each school, the dolphins sonar will help you locate the opening; a low pitched sound will indicate the opening is near the bottom of the screen, and a higher pitched sound indicates the opening is near the top. If you miss the opening, the dolphin will lose speed allowing the squid to catch up to you! From time to time, a seagull may fly overhead; if you jump out of the water and touch the seagull, your dolphin will temporarily be able to chase the squid. Throughout the ocean are waves which are indicated by arrows; an arrow pointing the same direction you are travelling will boost the dolphins speed, whereas an arrow pointing the opposite direction slows you down. The longer you stay alive, the faster and trickier the squid will become! The game ends when all of your dolphins have been caught by the squid.</desc>
	<path>./Donald Duck's Speedboat (USA) (Proto).rom</path>
	<desc>Donald has entered the Duckburg boat race and has taken to the sea with his speedboat. The objective is to steer the boat away from the obstacles along the way to the finish line and do so as fast as possible without losing pressure on the throttle. The game takes place across multiple screens which each presents its own obstacle patterns and challenges.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</desc>
	<path>./Donkey Kong Junior (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa!

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong. In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage. As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.

Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior. Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes. The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.

Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.

In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot. Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.

Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</desc>
	<path>./Double Dragon (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.</desc>

The treasures are being kept in various castles, each one guarded by a fire breathing dragon. Each level in the game has two parts; first you will need to cross the castle's drawbridge. You will have to jump and duck the dragons fireballs as well as avoid flying arrows to reach the other side! In the second part you need to collect all of the treasures on the screen and make it to the exit while avoiding the dragon who runs across the bottom of the screen. The dragons on each level have different patterns of movement and firing, and as the levels progress will become faster and trickier.</desc>
	<path>./Dragonstomper (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Long ago, a Druid magician created an amulet of great power that could subdue a dragon. Heading to the dragon's lair, the Druid accidentally dropped the amulet and it fell deep into its lair. Over time, the amulet imbued the dragon with cunning and power so that it began to spread treachery and evil about the peaceful Kingdom. The player's quest begins with the king summoning the player to defeat the dragon once and for all. Taking up the call to arms, the player begins by gathering their strength and fighting creatures in the enchanted countryside to build up enough power to become a Dragonstomper. When finally ready, the player moves on to an oppressed village near the dragon's lair in order to recruit soldiers, buy magical scrolls, and acquire medicines and elixirs needed to face the dragon in its lair. With all of his skills, training, equipment and soldiers, the Dragonstomper descends into the dragon's lair for a final combat to bring peace to the Kingdom.</desc>
	<path>./Dragster (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Dragster is a drag racing simulation for one or two players. The object of the game is to be the first car to race across the screen in the two player game, or to race across the screen in the shortest possible time in a one player game. The joystick acts as both the gas peddle and clutch; you have the ability to shift from first through fourth, but be careful not to shift too soon because you can't downshift! You must also be careful not to rev your engine too much, or you'll blow your engine and be out of the race. There are two game variations included; in the simpler game, you just need to drive straight to reach the goal. In the advanced variation, you also have the ability to steer and need to keep your car driving straight between the bleachers and road divider.</desc>

The object of the game is to find pieces of E.T.'s phone. Once all pieces are found, E.T. calls home and the spaceship arrives to pick him up. E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces scattered around in order to regain energy which is constantly depleted with time. 

The phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving. 

Evil scientists and agents wander around the area, trying to capture E.T. and steal the parts he's carrying.</desc>

	<path>./Eli's Ladder (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>This game was designed to help teach children addition, subtraction and counting. Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.

The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.

The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.

There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.</desc>

All very well but you note that there is a timer counting down. You have a suspicion that when it ends, so will you.

You begin in a maze on the lower left corner. You can move anywhere but cannot pass through walls or the outer perimeter. If you press fire, you can see a spotlighted area of the maze and by holding down the button, you can move the joystick around to see more maze. You must find the exit before the timer, which begins counting down as soon as you move, reaches zero. In the maze, there is a box that will give you more time. If the timer reaches zero, game is over. Once you exit the maze, you get any remaining time as your score. If you never used the spotlight in that maze, your score is doubled.</desc>

	<desc>Using an anti-matter launcher, you must defend the starbase L5 against a non-stop horde of blue Megalyte warrior ships and their death ships. As the warriors reach the bottom, they fire on your base. It does not hurt the base but would lose you one of your four lives. Sometimes the death ship takes a dive towards your base, firing as it goes. If it reaches your base, it will destroy your generator, losing you a life.

As hordes of Megalye ships descend, you can hold down the fire button. This will keep the anti-matter launcher in place and moving the paddle will shift the cursor and thus your aim. If you are in danger of being shot or need to destroy a death ship, just release the button and then you can move the launcher left or right.

There are 26 game variations. The odd numbered ones are one player, the even numbered are two player.

The archaeologists' only hope of survival (apart from some very fast running) is an ancient device known as the 'make-break', which can be used to either create or destroy pieces of wall.

In this increasingly frantic one or two-player arcade game, you'll need wits as well as dexterity. You'll have to think on the fly, plan strategically and race through the maze as fast as you can. Fail to keep up the pace and you're zombie fodder. Good luck!</desc>
	<path>./Escape from the Mindmaster (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You've been abducted! Kidnapped! Shanghaied! You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes.

You begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.

There are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:
Maze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.
Maze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow
Maze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence
Maze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once
Maze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five attempts.

You start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.

	<desc>You are a UFO. You must shoot tall and short towers above ground. You can shoot the short ones on any part of them but the tall ones must be shot at the firing spot. To shoot, you move in the direction you want to shoot, the press fire. You have to do this every time you shoot.

After you destroy ten towers, a tunnel will open so you can get underground. You will have three chances to get underground. If you choose to remain above ground, the firing rate of the enemies doubles.

Underground, the tunnel narrows after a time. If, after you hit ten towers underground, the firing speed doubles.

Points:
Hitting a tall above ground tower=50 points
Hitting a short above ground tower=20 points
Hitting an underground tower=50 to 360 points
Getting through tunnel safely without hitting a tower=20 points

After a certain amount of towers are hit, the ground turns from green to blue. When this happens, if you hit ten towers, you get an extra man. You can only have a maximum of eight extra men.</desc>

	<path>./Fantastic Voyage (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Fantastic Voyage is a vertically scrolling shooter for one player. The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.</desc>

You have to get at least nine prizes. After you get the ninth, High-Top will be low enough to jump over. You then jump over him to get the key above him. Then it is on the the next screen.

You get ten points for the first prize, twenty for the second, and so on up to ninety points for prizes nine and ten. You don't HAVE to get the tenth prize unless you want the extra ninety points.

After every screen, you get an extra Eddie; up to a maximum of three in reserve.</desc>

	<path>./Final Approach (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You are an air traffic controller at an international airport. You must guide planes in to landing safely.

Your first screen is the Approach Control Radar screen or ARC. You must guide the aircraft , using the cursor, until they are headed left to right along the yellow line headed towards the black stripe. Make sure the other planes are headed where they won't immediately head towards each other or off screen.

After the plane gets near the black stripe, move the cursor to the center red light and press the button. You will then be on the Ground Control Approach screen or GCA. Here you must center the plane's nose on the glide slope and localizer before it arrives at the end of the runway. If the landing is successful, the plane will disappear from the ARC screen and a new one will appear soon to take its place. If not, when you press your joystick button and return to the ARC screen, the plane will still be there. If a plane starts flashing on the ARC and you hear an emergency sound, this plane has an emergency and must be landed first.

Scoring
Successful landing=25 points
Successful emergency landing if landing before other planes=50 points
Aircraft wanders off radar=lose 5 points

You get a control error (lose a life) if you allow a near miss or do not immediately land an aircraft in distress. You are allowed an additional control error (extra life) every 500 points.

Your goal is to save the worker who is trapped in the warehouse; on the right side of the screen is a firetruck with an adjustable ladder. You can move the ladder to the appropriate floor of the building to climb up and rescue the trapped worker. Depending on which floors have caught fire, the worker will move to the lowest floor he can which isn't burning; you'll need to estimate which floor he'll be on when you position the ladder. Once the worker is safe, you move on to the next (more challenging) level. The fire in the building may spread quickly! If necessary, you can use a fire hose to put out the fire. Of course, you have a limited supply of water so make sure you don't run out! As the levels progress, the building becomes shorter and the fire spreads faster which means you don't have as much time in which to rescue the trapped victims.</desc>

When all the bricks are destroyed, you move on to the next round and are given one additional fireball to keep in play. Five different game variations are included:

Firetrap: Two additional fireballs are trapped within brick walls. Once a hole forms in the walls, you will also need to keep these additional fireballs in play.

Marching Blocks: In this game, each time you catch a fireball the rows of blocks will drop down one level. From time to time, a mystery fireball may also appear.

Knock-A-Block: This is the most basic game variation. There is a solid wall of blocks at the top of the screen that you need to destroy.

Migrating Blocks: In this game, the rows of blocks move! Every few seconds each row of blocks will rotate either to the left or to the right.

Cascade: There are five additional fireballs trapped within the block formation! When you destroy enough blocks to release an extra fireball, it too will need to be kept in play.</desc>

By moving the fishing line up or down, you can catch the fish that are swimming by. The deeper down you go, the bigger the fish are. When you catch a fish, you need to real it in! To make the game more difficult, a shark is constantly swimming back and forth. If you have a fish on your line and it touches the shark, the shark will eat it and you then will have to catch another fish. Two difficulty levels are available, and the game can be played by one person against the computer or two players against each other.</desc>
	<path>./Flag Capture (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Flag Capture is an action/strategy game for one or two players. Your goal is to locate a flag hidden somewhere on a 9x7 grid. Using the joystick you can move your explorer around the grid; on any square you can press the button to see if the flag is located in that square, or if not to receive a clue as to the flags location. If the square doesn't contain the flag, one of several items may appear: an arrow indicating what direction the flag is, a number indicating how many squares away the flag is, or a bomb which will cause you to have to start again. In the one player game your goal is to locate as many flags as possible in the 75 second time limit. There are several varieties of two players games: in free-for-all, both players can move around the grid simultaneously and whomever finds the flag first scores a point. In the other two player games, players take turns moving around the grid. Several skill levels are available which control the players moving speed, allow the flag to be stationary or move, or add an invisible wall around the playfield.</desc>

	<desc>You are Flash Gordon. Many spacemen have entered Spider City but never returned. Your job, Flash, is two fold. Rescue any spacemen you find in the tunnels of Spider City and destroy all the hatching pods.

The lower part of the screen is a map. You are the horizontal line, the hatching pods are the vertical lines and the Disrupters are the crosses. The upper part of the screen is the close-up of the action.

You rescue spacemen by touching them with your ship. You destroy hatching pods, and the spider warriors that hatch, by flying to the pods then shooting the warriors.

You can also shoot generators, patrol ships and debris. Shooting the generator will keep the Disrupter from moving about the city for a little bit but the debris never stops while you are within, so don't hang out in the Disrupter.

If you destroy five warriors at one hatching pod or your ship is destroyed when it returns, you will have a shield for a short time. There will be two beeps to warn you of the shield leaving.

The scoring is as follows:
10 points = Debris
25 points = Patrol Ship
70 points = Rescued Spaceman
100 points = Disrupter Generator

You get 100 points for killing the first warrior at a pod, 200 for the second, 300 for the third and so on.

You lose 1,000 points if you shoot a spaceman, but Flash Gordon would never do that, right?

Every time you conquer a city, you get an extra man.</desc>

In the second game, you have the option of controller your players after a play is selected or allowing the computer to control the players. The third game has the computer controlling the players at all times and you only need to select the plays you wish it to execute  and indicate when you wish to punt or pass the ball. In all of the game variations the timer begins at 5 minutes, and is active only during plays. Of course, the team with the most points when the timer runs out wins!</desc>

You must make your way two screens to the right to get to your tree. Animals will come at you from either side of the screen. You must either jump over the animal or press your button and push the joystick in the desired direction to chop them with your axe. Snakes cannot be chopped, only jumped over. 

Also to contend with is a bird in the air that is dropping stones. If you are hit by a stone, you will be unable to move for two seconds, which could prove fatal. Once you reach the tree, you must chop it down while still avoiding the animals. It takes four chops per side to fell the tree. If you need to, you can climb the tree to avoid animals. Once the tree is chopped, the game restarts at a faster level. You have only one life so if an animal touches you, it is game over.</desc>

Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.

You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.

Your orders are to snipe any gang member. DO NOT SHOOT AN INNOCENT! Watch out for Nitro Ed. He likes to play with hand grenades. One of those and you're pushing up daisies. Good luck.

You move the joystick to aim at a gangster and push the button to fire. Your ammo is limited so don't fire randomly. Occasionally, Nitro Ed, on the roof, will hold up a grenade. You must shoot him to disarm him. You get money for each gangster shot. The values for level one are:

1. Mugsy=$20
2. Scare Face=$30
3. Lefty=$40
4. Shifty=$50
5. Disarming Nitro Ed=$100

These amounts increase for each level by $10. You also get $10 for each bullet you have left after each level. There are six levels. The fourth level is a nighttime level. In this level, you must fire one bullet to light up the windows. If you do not fire for a couple seconds, they go dark again.
If you shoot an innocent, you will lose $1000 or you total amount if you have less than $1000.

If a gangster rises all the way out of a window, after a couple of seconds, he will shoot you and you will lose one bullet proof vest (life). After you lose all your vests, the game is over and Nitro Ed will laugh at you. If Nitro Ed gets off his hand grenade, no matter how many vests you have, the game is over.

As you go along, you can accelerate or decelerate to avoid being bombed but be careful because you might ram some ships near the ground. You can jump to avoid them or blast them for points. You will also see numbers along your way. Run into them to acquire their point value. Do not shoot them or their value will be deducted from you score.

As this is Gas Hog, you will soon run low on fuel. You must get below ground via the occasional holes, to grab a refuel marker.

Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>
	<path>./Ghostbusters (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

	<path>./Glib - Video Word Game (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600.

The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.

Difficulty switches
Use the left switch to set the number of players; B for one player, A for two.

Game variations
There are five games, each with five skill levels.
The skill levels differ by the amount of time you have to make words.
Skill levels for one player games:
Skill level 1=unlimited time (no clock)
Skill level 2=132 seconds
Skill level 3=39 seconds
Skill level 4=26 seconds
Skill level 5=random times
For two player games, the times are half of what they are in one player.

The games are:
Game 1 (Billboard): After each round, all the letters are reshuffled, so you get a whole new set of seven letters. Any letters that were not used go back into the mix.
Game 2 (Skill Builder): Only the letters you used to make the word are replaced. Any unused letters stay on the top spaces.
Game 3 (Times Up): You are given seven letters only. You must use these seven to make as many words as you can.
Game 4 (Encore): The letters on the top row all shift to the right, with the last letter disappearing and a new letter plopping into the first spot. You must grab you letters and place them quickly. Any letters the you don't use will reappear randomly again.
Game 5 (Over the Edge): Same as game 4 but letters that disappear never return.</desc>

	<path>./Golf (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Golf features a nine hole, par 36 course which can be played by one or two players. The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.</desc>
	<path>./Gopher (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>A pesky gopher is after your carrot patch! Your goal is to stop it before all of your carrots are gone. The gopher will be tunneling in the ground at the bottom of the screen; you are at the top and need to fill in the gophers tunnels with your shovel. The gopher is fast, however, and if you don't fill in the tunnels quick enough it will make it to the surface and run off with one of your carrots! If the gopher manages to take all of your carrots, the game will be over. From time to time there will be a duck that flies overhead. As the duck passes by, it will drop a seed; if you catch the seed and plant it, a new carrot will grow to replace one of the ones that was stolen. Several difficulty levels are included, which control the speed and intelligence of the gopher, and whether or not the duck will appear.</desc>
	<path>./Gorf (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Gorf is a game similar to Space Invaders, alien vessels approach closer and closer in their threatening row formation.

The game itself consists of four levels:

1. The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship &amp; shield on one side and the aliens on the other side;

The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;

The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading "towards" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;

The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.

Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.</desc>
	<path>./GoSub (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>You are a submarine driver in search of sunken treasure off the coast of Cape Chammawingiwakauguflidplitargoknotz. Your job: Get the treasure chests and be rich! But there are dangers: it seems the treasures are well protected by walls and a pesky octopus. Go luck and be careful, Captain.

You pilot your sub through a maze, avoiding touching the deadly walls. Your goal is to reach the treasure chest at the end of the maze. Don't let the octopus completely cover your sub or you will die. Be aware that the octopus will slow you down so be prepared for a burst of speed once you are past.

The two player game, dubbed GoSub 500 by the creators, is a counter-clockwise race around an oval track. First to cross the finish line wins.</desc>
	<path>./Grand Prix (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Grand Prix is an action racing game for one player. The game is played with an overhead view of the racetrack which scrolls horizontally. Your goal is to reach the finish line in the shortest possible time on one of the four different tracks included. Of course, there will be obstacles on the tracks which will slow you down if you're not careful. Numerous other cars will often get in your way, oil slicks will cause you to temporarily lose control, and on the more difficulty tracks narrow bridges will cause you to come to a complete stop if you miss the path.</desc>
	<path>./Gravitar (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.</desc>
	<path>./Gremlins (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>This game is based on the Steven Spielberg movie of the same name but is different than the other versions.

In this version, on the first screen, Mogwai are jumping from the roof to get at hamburgers on the ground. You, as Billy, must catch them before the hit the ground. If you get them all, it is off to the next, faster, level. If you miss eight, then you go to a shooting screen.

On the shooting screen, gremlins are approaching from the distance. You must shoot them before they reach you. If one reaches you, you lose a life. After they are all dead, it is back to the first screen at a faster level. In later levels, puddles of water will divide the gremlins in two.</desc>

You control a spaceship which is the last hope to save the planets. Unfortunately, your ships lasers are unable to reach Dromeda, so you you must shoot the explosives as they come in. If you miss any explosives, they will destroy part of the shield. If a large enough hole forms, an explosive could get through and destroy an entire planet. The game ends when all of your planets have been destroyed.</desc>

	<desc>The entire solar system is being attacked by the vicious Gyrusians, and it's up to you to save the day! You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</desc>

	<desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

Guess a correct letter, and it will appear on the screen in the proper location, but if you guess a letter that isn't in the word then you are one step closer to being hung. Guess eleven incorrect letters, and the game is over. A point is earned each time a word is completed. Several difficulty settings are included which affect the number of letters in the words. The game can be played by one or two players, and in the two player version the words can optionally be created by one of the players instead of the computer.</desc>

	<path>./Haunted House (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the  four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.

The mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!

You are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn, you will need to put down the scepter so be careful! You win the game when all three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the better the score!</desc>
	<path>./Holey Moley (USA) (Proto).rom</path>
	<desc>It's video Whack-A-Mole!

Each round consists of twenty-five moles. When a mole pops out of his hole, press the corresponding button on the Kid's Controller to whack it. The faster you hit him, the more points you'll get. If the King Mole pops up, whack him for even higher points. Beware of the acorn. If it pops up, don't whack it as it will cost you points. You must score at least three hundred points by the time the mole count reaches zero. If you reach or exceed three hundred points in one round, any points beyond three hundred will be added to your score as a bonus. If you fail to score three hundred points in one round, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Home Run (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base. 

The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</desc>
	<path>./Human Cannonball (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land in a bucket of water. To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.</desc>

The gameplay in question involves a progression through 14 levels 
of platforming to impress Esmeralda, climbing up and down ladders to gather bells while avoiding guards and a regular stream of missiles being fired in from the sides.

At any given time one player is active and can be controlled while the other remains inactive; if the puck is near your goal then the defensive player becomes active, otherwise you control the offensive player. Each player has the ability to shoot the puck at a variety of angles, and can even body check their opponent! The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player more of an advantage.</desc>

In the two player game, the first player to complete 25 laps wins! Included are several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and additional game variations called ice race, tag, and crash 'n score. In ice race, the track is icy causing your car to slide often and making it difficulty to steer.  In tag, one player is "it" and needs to tag the other player. For each second you race without being tagged, a point is earned. Lastly, in crash 'n score the goal is to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the track.</desc>

You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out.

	<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>
	<path>./JoustPong (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>This is a variation on the classic game Pong that adds flapping wings to your paddles. You must press your flap button repeatedly to go up and stop pressing to come down.

In the Atari 2600 version, there is also a pterodactyl on the screen the interferes with the ball or your paddle. The Atari 2600 version also includes a variation referred to as 'Poorlords' that adds a wall of bricks behind the players that must be busted through to score points.</desc>
	<path>./Jr. Pac-Man (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Jr. Pac-Man features gameplay similar to the original Pac-Man, but with a few changes. As Jr., you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.</desc>

	<path>./Jungle Hunt (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty once all four have been survived.  If you don't survive these adventures, you will not only lose your own life but that of the lovely Penelope, who has been captured by cannibals!

The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines without plummeting to your doom? The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river. Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with. Don't forget to go up for air! In the third part, you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics. Once you've cleared all these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked spear. Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?

Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile phase). The view is always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.</desc>
	<path>./Juno First (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>There is no one left. No attack fleet. No reinforcements. Just you and a handful of reserve ships. Enemy forces are threatening the Juno colony-Earth's last defense post. You must fend off wave after wave of enemy ships, skimming dangerously above the planet's force field. How long can you hold them off? You must persevere-whoever controls Earth, must take Juno first!</desc>

	<desc>Kabobber was originally a prototype game that was programmed by Rex Bradford, known for his work on Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Jedi Arena. It was discovered in 2000 and improved upon a little before being released to the public in ROM format. Kabobbers are strange (but cute) little creatures who just love wreaking havoc. Your objective is to send in your Buvskies to krush the Kabobbers before they krush you. You can have up to nine Buvskies onscreen at one time, but you have reserves waiting offscreen should one get krushed. You move your Bruvskies across the grid, jumping on enemy Kabobbers in order to defeat them and earn additional reserve Bruvskies. The baby Bruvskies become big ones when they defeat an enemy. The enemies get tougher and tougher, meaning very good timing is required in the later stages. Above all, you must reach Princess Buvsky before she reaches the rainbow energy at the other end of the level and devours it. A very unique game, but also somewhat fun.</desc>
	<path>./Kaboom! (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>The mad bomber is on the loose! As he races back and forth at the top  of the screen, you need to catch the bombs he drops in buckets of water. One point is earned for each bomb caught, but miss one of the bombs, and Kaboom! As the levels progress, the mad bomber will move faster and faster and drop more and more bombs. You start the game with three buckets, and lose one each time a bomb is missed. The game ends when all of your water buckets are gone.</desc>

	<desc>Baby Roo has been kidnapped by monkeys, and it's up to Mama Roo to come to the rescue! Your kangaroo starts out at the bottom of the screen. You need to guide the kangaroo up the various ladders and platforms to the top where Baby Roo is being held captive. The monkeys will be trying to stop you by throwing or dropping apples and knocking you off the platforms. Your kangaroo has boxing gloves, however, and can knock out the monkeys with a single punch! Along the way various types of fruit can be collected to earn bonus points.</desc>
	<path>./Karate (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Karate is a fighting game for two players or one player against the computer. Your goal is to earn a black belt by winning a series of fights. By moving the joystick in various directions and pushing the button, you can use a variety of kicks and punches which are each worth varying amounts of points if successful. Each fight lasts for two minutes, and at the end of that time the points earned will be added up to determine who the winner is. There are two difficulty levels available.</desc>
	<path>./Keystone Kapers (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</desc>
	<path>./Killer Satellites (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>For decades, the weapons satellites have orbited Earth harmlessly. Now, for unknown reasons, they have dropped from the sky to obliterate mankind. You are a test pilot with an experimental craft that can stop the satellites. It is up to you to protect your home town.

You fly above your town's forcefield. Satellites will drop from the sky and show on the radar area at the screen top. You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the ability to penetrate the town's shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town's shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram into one.</desc>
	<path>./King Kong (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>King Kong has taken a lady to the top of the Empire State Building. It is up to you to rescue her but it won't be easy. Kong is throwing bombs at you.

This game is a clone of Donkey Kong, except instead of barrels, you must avoid bombs. You must make your way across the floors and up the ladders while jumping over bombs for points and holes in the floor. There is also a timer in the upper right. It starts at nine-hundred ninety and counts down ten points per second. If you are hit by a bomb or fall through a hole in the floor or the time reaches zero, you lose a life. Occasionally, Kong will release a magic bomb that gives more points when you jump it as well as moves you to the next floor up. Once you reach the top floor, the game starts again but faster.</desc>

Kool-Aid man must gather up Kool-Aid soft drink mix in order to catch and put a stop to the Thirsties' scheme. The three ingredients are Water (W), Sugar (S), and Kool-Aid (K). If the Thirsties touch Kool-Aid Man, he gets bounced around the yard, losing time, and the pool gets drained further. 

If the Thirsties succeed in draining the pool, it's "Game Over" for Kool-Aid Man. If Kool-Aid Man succeeds, then he wins and goes on to the next level of difficulty. Oh Yeah!</desc>
	<path>./Krull (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Krull is a multi part action game based on the movie of the same name. A beast and his army have traveled through space until finally landing on the distant planet of Krull and ravaging the entire planet. But there is a prophecy which tells of a king and queen who will someday take back the planet. These future rulers are Princess Lyssa and Prince Colwyn. But before their marrage, Princess Lyssa is captured by the beast! 

You play the part of Prince Colwyn on a mission to rescue Lyssa and destroy the beast. The game is divided up into several parts.

The first part takes place during the foiled wedding. A large number of slayers arrive at the castle, and you need to defeat as many as you can to earn points. But eventually Princess Lyssa is captured.

In the next section you need to ride your horse towards the Widow's web; on the way you can collect Glaives which may be used to fight the beast. Once you reach the web, you need to make your way to the cocoon at the top of the web in order to find the correct path to the Black Fortress. The crystal spider along with strands of the web make maneuvering your way around this screen a challenge. Once you know the correct path, you ride on to the Black Fortress. 

Here you need to use the Glaives you've collected to free the Princess from a prison, and then destroy the beast! After successfully completing all tasks, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>
	<path>./Kung-Fu Master (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>A conversion of the arcade game of the same name, which itself is loosely based on a movie, Kung-Fu Master is a side scrolling action game for one or two players, who alternate turns.

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.</desc>
	<path>./Lady Bug (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>An action game in the same style as Pac-Man but very very different. Players control a ladybug who must venture around different mazes collecting all of the food pellet "x"'s. In addition to there being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game.  In the center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned every time the border around the screen makes a complete "lap". Timers for the border vary upon the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.

In addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses. However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to that colour's word. The red word is "SPECIAL" and the yellow word is "EXTRA". Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus round.

Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the X's being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player dies, but letter powerups are not.</desc>

But be careful, they are fully armed with their own lasers and have no intention of letting you take them out easily! The more enemy vehicles you destroy, the more points you earn. If you do get hit by a laser blast, your spacecraft will fall to the ground and crash. When hit you still have one last chance to take out an enemy by maneuvering the spacecraft to crash land on top of it.</desc>
	<path>./Laser Gates (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Laser Gates is a side scrolling shooter. Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the force fields.</desc>

As you collect diamonds you need to bring them back to the shark cage in order to earn points. Swimming back and forth constantly is a deadly shark. If the shark encounters any of the diamonds, it will eat them; likewise you can also be eaten by the shark, causing you to lose a life. You have no defense against the shark, however you are immune if you are in the shark cage and the doors are closed. Somewhere in the maze the Loch Ness monster remains hidden. If you disturb the monster, it will continuously chase you unless you can lead it back into one of the caves located in the corners of the screen.</desc>

	<desc>Lock 'n' Chase is an arcade action game similar to Pac-Man. You play a thief who is trapped in a maze like vault. To get out, you need to collect all of the gold dots located in the maze. Your task won't be easy, since there are four police officers in the vault who are constantly trying to catch you! Located throughout the maze are numerous doors. As you run through the maze, you have the ability to temporarily close a door in an attempt to block the police. You can only close two doors at a time, and any closed doors automatically open again after a short amount of time. When all of the gold in the maze has been collected, the exit to the vault will open and you can escape and move on to the next, more difficult vault. Occasionally a bonus item will appear in the maze, such as a cash bag, crown, or briefcase, which can be collected to earn even more points.</desc>
	<path>./London Blitz (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>During WWII German bombers turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Most bombs exploded on impact but some would sit for hours, days or weeks before detonating. It was up to the Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXB's) before they exploded. As a Lance Corporal in the Royal Engineers, it is your job to defuse these bombs.

First, you will check your London map to see where the bombs are. Then it is defusing time. 

On the C64, you must use the joystick to cause the dial to rotate, changing the numbers next to a switch then clicking on the disarm switch at the bottom. If the number is wrong, you must change it again and keep trying. 

On the Atari 2600, you slide a sliding bar. On green bombs, the top bar controls the left switch, the middle the middle and the bottom the right.You set the slide to a spot the move to the switches and push right. On orange bombs, what slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb and on blue bombs, you can't control the switches. They just randomly change and you push right and hope you disarm in time.

The possible ranks are:
Lance Corporal
Corporal
Sargent
Staff Sargent
Warrant Officer
Second Lieutenant
First Lieutenant
Captain

At the start of the game, you can select which rank to start at, from Lance Corporal to Second Lieutenant on the C64 or from Lance Corporal to First Lieutenant on the Atari 2600.

Every time you disarm a bomb, you move up levels within your rank. Move up eight levels and you are promoted. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage, you are demoted a level in rank.

You lose the game is you are demoted below Lance Corporal or a bomb explodes while you are near it, a not-very-healthy thing to happen.

You win if you get promoted to Captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.</desc>

As the levels progress, more and more luggage will need to be caught, and the games speed increases. There are two difficulty levels available; the easier mode gives you two men to catch luggage with, and the harder mode gives you only one man. Several other game variations are also available: if the terrorist suitcase option is enabled, explosive suitcases will occasionally appear. If you don't catch these, the game immediately ends regardless of how many lives you have left.

Waves of rockets and other ships will fly by on the screen, and occasionally one will drop in an attempt to destroy one of the stations (as a warning on most levels, the enemy will turn white just before it drops). You need to make sure you shoot it before your energy station is destroyed! When all six energy stations are gone, the game is over.

	<desc>M*A*S*H was one of the many attempts by various software companies to take a successful movie or television show and convert it into a playable game.

In this game, you play the role of "Hawkeye Pierce," a surgeon stationed at the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital #4077 during the Korean War (1950-1953). There are two main stages in the game, each of which you must pass to move to the next round. The first mission involves rescuing injured soldiers from the battlefield with your helicopter and returning them to home base without being shot down by enemy tanks. The second mission takes place in the operating room while you are required to carefully remove bullets and shrapnel from wounded soldiers... it is very similar to the classic "OPERATION" tweezers game by Milton Bradley.

Each set of missions are repeated four times. The first player to reach 999 points wins the game. There are four different variations of games, each selectable as either one player (against the computer) or two-player mode.</desc>

There are three airlock doors per starbase. You must get the correct key for each door. Each is held by one of three Malagai. The order of which Malagai is holding which key is shown by the pictures above the starbase.

If you are away from your assigned compartment for too long, as indicated by the line at the bottom of the screen, the Malagai will attack and you will need to return to your compartment to make them friendly again. When you touch a Malagai and, if it is the correct one, get the airlock door key, the Malagai will attack and the airlock will flash, on most game variations (see below). You must then make your way to the airlock. One door will disappear and the Malagai will become friendly again. After you open the third door, it is off to the next starbase.

After the third (blue) starbase, you get an extra man.

Game Variations:
Version 1: All the Malagai have different shapes and colors
Version 2: All the Malagai have the same shape but different colors
Version 3: All Malagai are the same shape and color and the airlocks do not blink to show you got the right key.

Scoring:
Touch a Malagai while they're friendly=100 points (50 point bonus if it has the correct key)
Open airlocks one or two=100 points
Open airlock three to exit starbase orange or teal=150 points
Open airlock three to exit blue starbase=250 points

	<desc>Mama Mia! That's a  lots a pasta!

Mama brings pasta to the table. You must either eat the pasta, toss it to Frankie the cat when he is at the window, or toss it to Sergio the dog when he is under the table.

You have four lives. If you eat more than 20 plates of pasta, you will burst (literally) and lose 1 life. If more than 9 plates of pasta are placed on the table, it will collapse and you will lose 1 life.

To eat pasta, you move the joystick to the right then the left. To toss pasta to a pet, you move the joystick to the right then up or down in one smooth motion. You must throw when Mama's back is turned and the cat is in the window or the dog is in the right spot under the table. If you throw food at the floor or window when the pet is not in position or if Mama sees you throw food to a pet, she will bring 3 plates the next time. Remember, over nine plates on the table and it is arrivederci una vita (goodbye one life).

To clear a level, you must eat or toss a certain number of plates of pasta.
1=31
2=32
3=35
4=37
5=40
6=42
7=45
8=47
9=49

The point value of each plate of pasta starts at 5 at level 1 and increases by 1 point per level, to a maximum of 13 at level 9.
You get an extra life at every 1,000 points. The highest points you can reach is 9,999.</desc>

In the first part of the game, you control the Wind Raider flying towards Castle Grayskull. You have a limited amount of fuel with which to reach your destination, plus numerous fireballs will be flying around the screen trying to stop you and Skeletor will be running along the ground. The Wind Raider is equipped with bombs and guns which can be used to defend yourself from the fireballs, and also can earn bonus points if you can hit Skeletor.

	<path>./Miner 2049er Volume II (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Bounty Bob has tracked Yukon Yohan into Nuclear Ned's uranium mine. Bob must 'claim' each section of each part of the mine...but cannot take too long in each area, or the radiation will kill him.

Taking the role of Bob, players must traverse through different types of areas inside the nuclear mine. In the first level, "Lift", Bob must walk on each part of the screen to 'claim' it. Avoid the monsters by jumping over them or grab an old miner possession to become energized and grab a mutant for points. Use the lift to reach the higher parts of the screen.

The next area is the Crusher, with the same goal as Lift but more challenging as the player must also avoid getting crushed. The last part is the Radioactive Waste, where the goal is again the same, but the player must maneuver Bob around the radioactive waste. In each screen, there is a timer in the upper right. If this timer reached zero before you claim all sections, you lose a life.

After you have beaten all three screens, they repeat but without any of the bonuses for energizing, so you must jump over or avoid all mutants.</desc>
	<path>./Mines of Minos (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You are the last mining robot on the Minos mine. Monsters have destroyed all your comrades.

As the last robot, you must traverse the mine's various levels, gathering spare parts to make more robots (extra lives). You must either avoid the monsters or blow them up with a bomb. After a few seconds, if the monster hasn't hit the bomb, it will explode harmlessly. You can only drop one bomb at a time. If a monster is killed, it will regenerate somewhere in the maze.

To deposit your spare parts, you must get to the center top or bottom of any level. To move to another level, hold your joystick button down while moving through the tunnels on either side. You can also use these tunnels, without holding down the button, to quickly get from left or right side of the maze to avoid monsters.

To win the game, get to level five and ram each of the three stationary monsters to kill them. You will need at least two spare robots as the ramming will destroy you and the monster.

In two player games, player one is the robot, player two is a monster. If the robot runs into the monster being controlled, the monster is destroyed instead of the robot. However, by pushing the joystick button, player two can switch to another monster, allowing the robot to run into an uncontrolled (and therefore deadly) monster.

	<desc>This is a computer game simulation of a Miniature Golf course. It attempts to refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance.  As in a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the "cup."  Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated.

Rather than a full 18 holes, this Miniature Golf variation has a nine-hole half-course. Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the cup. The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes. While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it. So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole.

Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.</desc>

If anything gets through, one of your cities could be destroyed. When all of the cities are gone, the game is over. On each level you have a limited amount of ammo, so make sure most (if not all) of your shots are accurate or you could run out of ammo and leave your cities at risk! As the levels progress, there are more and more enemy weapons to destroy which come in at an increasingly faster rate.</desc>

	<desc>Missile Control is a Missile Command-style game. The player has to defend their cities from incoming bombs fire by alien spaceships.

The player controls a cursor on the screen which indicates the direction of fire for the defense missiles. Once launched, they travel in a straight line from the launcher through the point the player specified until they hit an object. Each level is won by destroying all alien spaceships. The player loses once all their cities are destroyed. Bonus cities can be obtained by destroying a sufficient number of alien spacecraft.

The game gets progressively harder, for example bombs will fall faster and energy barriers might protect the aliens from the player's attacks. To get around the barriers, players can deflect their shots from large defense missiles launched at the sides of the screen.</desc>

As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>

In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. 

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.</desc>

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

	<path>./Obelix (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>A classic Asterix &amp; Obelix game where you simultaneously play as (both) Asterix and Obelix maintaining their favorite Gaulish sport of thumping the living daylights out of Roman soldiers.

The objective of the game is to help Asterix "stun" Roman soldiers (simply by running into them, and they turn white from blue) while you command good ol'Obelix to throws his oversized Menhirs down at stunned Romans with a splat.

If by any chance a stunned soldier is not whacked by a flying menhir, they turn "red" and hostile, which means Asterix is in trouble. In any case, he needs some good ol' magic potion from Getafix in order to defeat the "red" Romans, so be ready to catch some when Getafix comes knocking.

There are 2 types of Roman soldiers to thump: the fat legionnaires and the small centurions. Centurions are worth more points.</desc>
	<path>./Off the Wall (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Off The Wall is an arcade action game with Breakout style gameplay. You control Kung Fu Lu, whose mission is to destroy a mysterious, evil wall by reflecting a bouncing ball into the bricks that make up the wall. When the bricks are hit by the ball, they are destroyed. On the top of the screen is a mystical dragon which guards the wall. Each level can be completed by either destroying all of the bricks in the wall, or hitting the dragon six times with the ball. Once the first level is completed, a blackbird will also appear on screen just below the wall. The blackbird will deflect the ball, and tries to get in the way to make your mission more difficult. From time to time, a magic token will fall downward which gives you special powers if caught. These can make the ball magnetic and follow your player, give you a larger paddle, or make the ball explosive and take out larger chunks of bricks. You start the game at a skill level of Peasant, and advance in rank every time four waves of bricks are cleared. You lose a life every time the ball falls off the bottoms of the screen, and the game ends when you lose all five of your lives.</desc>
	<path>./Off Your Rocker (USA) (Proto).rom</path>
	<desc>Off Your Rocker is a Simon Says... type game for one to four players, alternating. The character on the screen will lean towards a colored shape while a tone sounds. You must lean in the same direction on your joyboard. As the game progresses, the sequences get longer and more complex. In two or more player games, each player alternates to see who can do the most sequences.</desc>
	<path>./Official Frogger, The (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Starpath Version - The player guides a frog which starts at the bottom of the screen, to his home in one of 5 slots at the top of the screen. The lower half of the screen contains a road with motor vehicles, which in various versions include cars, trucks, buses, dune buggies, bulldozers, vans, taxis, bicyclists, and/or motorcycles, speeding along it horizontally.</desc>
	<path>./Oink! (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Oink! is based on the fairy tale of the three little pigs. The big bad wolf is trying to blow down each of the pigs houses. You control each pig one at a time. The wolf is at the bottom of the screen and will blow a hole in the house one section at a time. Each time a hole is formed, the pig must patch it up quickly so the wolf can't get in. New materials are located at the top of the screen, and you need to grab them and place them in the holes as they are formed. The longer you last, the tougher the wolf will become! You start the game controlling the pig whose house is made of straw; when he is caught, you move on to the pig in the house made of sticks. Finally you will control the pig in the house made of bricks. When all three pigs have been caught by the wolf, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Okie Dokie (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>Okie Dokie is a puzzle game where you are to clear the screen of all the items. You do this by clicking the item to 'flip' it to off. But things are not as easy as that. When you flip an item, the spaces above, below, to the left and to the right of it are reversed. If the items in those spaces were on, they turn off but if the items in those spaces were off, they turn back on. Try to clear the screen in the fewest moves.</desc>
	<path>./Omega Race (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game.  You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you.  Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too.  The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</desc>
	<path>./Open Sesame (Europe).rom</path>
	<desc>Open, Sesame! is an action platform game. You control Ali Baba, and your goal is to reach the cave of treasures. The treasury entrance is at the top of the screen, and you begin each level at the bottom and need to climb your way up. To do so, you will need to find a good location where you can throw a rope up to the next platform and climb up (there will be a dot on the platform where you can safely throw a rope, two on each floor). Before the treasury can be entered, you need to attach ropes to each of the possible locations. To hinder your progress, there are guards wandering each of the floors. If you're caught, you'll lose a life! To help out, a magic ball will appear on screen from time to time; if caught, this can be used to temporarily freeze a guard. When you successfully enter the treasury, you then move on to the next level of gameplay.</desc>
	<path>./Oscar's Trash Race (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>It is the Grouch Day Picnic and three little grouches (Herman, Grungetta and Sloppy) want to win the Trash Race.

Game one is a practice race. The trash truck dumps one to five items. One of the trash cans at the top will then have a number on it. Press the button on the controller for that can the use the arrow keys to move it to the trash. Once you get the trash, move the grouch back to the top. You get one point per race. There are three races per game then Oscar appears to congratulate the winner (in his own grouchy way).

Game two is the same as game one except there will be a number on all three trash cans and you must select the one that corresponds to the number of items.

Both games one and two are one player only.

In games three and four, the truck dumps one to nine items. You again select the correct grouch but this time there are puddles, three in game three, several in game four. You get one point for each puddle you jump. If you step into a puddle, the grouch will play in it, delaying you. There are three races in game three, five in game four.

In game five, you run races one after another until Slimey the inchworm gets from one side of the screen to the other. Once Slimey get to the other side, the races ends. There are several puddles. You get one point per puddle jumped and one point per race completed.

Games six and seven are the same as five but it will rain sometimes. When it does, the puddles turn blue. If you jump a blue puddle, you get two points.

The trash items are:
bones
hangers
coffee mugs
toothbrush (presumably used)
old tin can
old televisions
old ten-gallon hats
old telephones
old tennis shoes
old dress shoes
junk mail
scissors
old toy boats
hammers
beach balls

For ages three to seven.</desc>
	<path>./Othello (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Othello is a conversion of the board game. Each player tries to fill the game board with as many discs of his color as possible. On each turn the player places a disc on the board by selecting a location where the opponents discs will become trapped between two of his discs. The trapped discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when the board is filled or time runs out, and the player with the greatest number of his color discs on the board wins. Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.</desc>
	<path>./Out of Control (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>This is an obstacle race in a space ship. The ship controls in a rather Asteroids-like way, in that you push left or right to rotate and press fire to thrust. Once you stop thrusting, the ship does not immediately stop, although it will slow down on its own. To stop sooner, you have to face away from the direction you are traveling and thrust.

First, you must pass a set number of hurdles. If there is a single hurdle, you must pass on the side indicated by the arrow. If there are two hurdles, you must pass in between them. If there are three, you can pass through them or go around. If you hit a hurdle, you must go back to the last successfully passed hurdle and do it again to continue.

After the hurdles, you must pop ten space balloons by running in to them. They appear one at a time at random spots on the screen. After you pop all ten balloons, you must dock in the space dock to end the race.

The difficulty switches are not used. You select your game variation by moving the joystick up or down.

Game variations
There are 28 variations. The odd numbered ones have fast maneuvering, the even numbered ones, slow.

The number of hurdles also varies. The first two have 10 hurdles, the next two, 14, then 22 (twice), 27 (twice), 35 (twice), 39 (four times), 47 (twice), 51 (twice), 54 (twice), 63 (twice), 64 (twice), 72 (twice), and 82 (twice).</desc>

	<desc>You're a gunslinger in the old west! Outlaw features both one and two player games. In the one player version, your goal is to shoot a moving target as many times as possible in 99 seconds. In the two player version, each player tries to be the first to shoot his opponent ten times. Several game variations are included in both the one and two player versions. In the middle of the screen is one of several possible obstacles to make the game more difficult. A giant cactus, a stagecoach, a moving stagecoach, or a breakable wall all can block the target or provide some shelter for you to hide from your opponents shots. You also have the choice of unlimited fire, or only a six shooter. If you choose the six shooter, then each player must use up all six shots before either player can reload. And lastly, there is the "getaway" option. With getaway, a player may move immediately after firing; without getaway, a player must remain stationary for as long as his bullet is on the screen.</desc>

	<desc>"In the Irata solar system lies the planet Stella. It is surrounded by an energy belt. In this belt there live space oysters. They make good food, so there are other outer space creatures living among them, that eat the oysters..." 

The space oysters are headed your way. You must shoot them to reveal pearls. Collect the pearls and deposit them in the Pearls Zone. Defend you pearls from being stolen or destroyed by attacking enemies. Near the end of each level, you must destroy the Oystron by dropping bombs. There is also a warp phase where you must travel at high speed between space oysters and enemies.</desc>
	<path>./Pac-Man (Atari) (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Bop a Buggy: Drive your buggy through the course fastest to the finish line. Watch out for the buggy boppers, as they will throw bricks at you, slowing you up. In a two player game, each player controls a buggy and the computer controls the buggy boppers. In a four player game, two players control a buggy apiece and the other two control a buggy bopper apiece.

Tug of War: Simply pull the other team over the center line. In a two player game, each player control an entire team, each. In a four player game, each player controls one of the four players.

Wizard's Keep: Use the power of magic to destroy more targets for points than the opposing team. In a two player game, each player controls a pair of wizards. In a four player game, each player controls one wizard apiece.

Down on the Line: You must get a package from the left conveyor belt and pass it to the second worker who will then move it to the belt on the right that matches the package color. The game clock starts at 8:00 and the game ends when the clock reaches 5:00. In a two player game, each player controls a pair of workers. The package will pass from one worker to the other automatically. In a four player game, each player controls one worker apiece and must use the fire button to pass the package as well place it on the conveyor belt.

	<path>./Phantom II - Pirate (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>This cartridge contains two games: Phantom II and Pirate.

Phantom II: Come fly the not-so-friendly skies.
Based on a 1979 Bally Midway coin-op game, you must fight your way through enemy planes to find and destroy the enemy bomber within the time limit. Do not ram the enemies as you only have one life. In the night time scenes, the enemy is only visible when the radar sweeps over them.

Pirate:
Can you find the treasure of the evil pirate "Up" Chuck LeDuc? Beware! His bony corpse wanders the island looking to protect it! Also watch out for snakes and the voodoo priestess!

Use your joystick to move about the island and use the button to fight, pick up an item, use an item and enter or exit the hut. You can carry nothing, a sword and/or a shovel but you must have the shovel when you reach the X that marks the treasure.</desc>
	<path>./Phantom Tank (Europe).rom</path>
	<desc>In Phantom-Panzer, the player takes control of an assault vehicle in order to defend their "energy base" at the bottom of the screen from the attacking phantom tanks.

The game consists of three phases: the first phase takes place in a city and looks like a maze. It offers relative protection with the building walls. The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there's practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it's an all-out battle with the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player's base and no obstacles to stop them.

The player can only shoot one bullet at a time and has to destroy 20 tanks in each stage. Enemy bullets can be canceled by hitting them with one's own bullet. The player loses one life if they collide with one of the tanks or the enemy bullets. The game is over immediately, however, if an enemy tank or shell hits the player's energy base.</desc>

	<desc>In Phaser Patrol you are the pilot of an interstellar spaceship on a mission to defend the Human Federation from the deadly Dracon armada. Gameplay is similar to Star Raiders. You begin with a view of the sector map, and need to warp to a sector where the Dracon are located. Once you've reached your destination, the game switches to a first person point of view where you need to destroy all enemy fighters located in the sector. Once the sector is cleared, you can return to the sector map and warp to a new location. The mission is successful when all sectors containing enemy fighters have been cleared. Your ship has a limited amount of energy; energy is depleted by warping to new sectors, or by taking damage from enemy fighters. If your energy runs out the game is over, however you can recharge your ship by visiting one of the friendly starbases that are located throughout the galaxy (visiting a starbase will also repair any equipment that has been damaged, such as the photon torpedoes or sector scanner).  The game is timed, and the faster you can complete your mission the better your ranking at the end will be!</desc>

If the mothership is destroyed, the game will then repeat, but with increased speed and difficulty. To defeat the numerous enemies, the Phoenix is equipped with a laser cannon and a force field.</desc>
	<path>./Pick 'n' Pile (Europe).rom</path>
	<desc>Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.

In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</desc>

	<desc>OK, here's the deal. If you want that lover of your dreams to get off their pedestal and go out with you, you need to present them with the right gifts. Then you can head over to the Love Nest Hotel to really score!

You start with your lover of a pedestal on the left and various items floating above you. You must shoot each item once to acquire it. If an item starts flashing, shoot it next because after a short time, you'll lose a chance. If you shoot an item a second time, you will lose it and a chance. Lose all your chances and the game is over. If you collect all the items needed, head over to the pedestal then head off the screen to the right. Head to the door of the hotel and the hotel sign will say how many times you have scored. Now head left to start the next level.</desc>

	<desc>You are out enjoying a picnic, when suddenly a swarm of flies arrive! You control a fly swatter at the bottom of the screen; your goal in this game is to protect your hamburgers (located on the left and right bottom of the screen) from the attacking flies. When a fly is close enough, it will stick out its tongue to eat the food. If you can swat the fly right when it has its tongue out, it will be knocked out and fall into your fly trap. When all of the flies have been knocked into the trap, you will then need to face a large super fly before the level is complete (be careful, it can eat your food fast!) After knocking out the super fly, you move on to the next round. The game ends when all of your hamburgers have been completely eaten.</desc>
	<path>./Piece o' Cake (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In Piece o' Cake you are a chef, and your goal is to successfully build cakes! At the bottom of the screen is a conveyor belt, and a platter will appear at the left side moving towards the right. You are at the top of the screen, and need to take cake layers from the oven and drop them onto the platter. The cake layers are different sizes, and you must drop them such that each layer is the same size or smaller than the one beneath it. After you have created a cake, you need to top it off with a cherry. If you are unable to successfully create a cake with the layers in the proper order and a topped with a cherry before the platter reaches the right side of the screen, it will fall off the conveyor and you lose a life. The different size cake layers come out of the oven randomly, so if you get a size you don't want it can be dropped off at the right side of the screen until a layer you do want appears. Although you can build cakes of different sizes, bonus points are earned for building a perfect cake consisting of one large layer, one medium layer, one small layer, and a cherry. As the game progresses, the conveyor will pick up speed to make cake building tougher.</desc>
	<path>./Pigs in Space - Starring Miss Piggy (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Now it's time for...PIIIIIIGS IN SPAAAAACE!!!

This game is really three smaller games. You select what to play to choosing which character you want.
For Captain Link Hogthrob, it is Chickenvaders. A Pigs in Space take in Atari's Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders.
While exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space chickens. Captain Link must destroy them before they make their way all the way to the planet. He does this by firing link sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken! You also lose a life. From time to time, Gonzo flies across the screen top in his saucer. You can hit him for points also.

Scoring
Hitting a chicken on...
Row one=10 points
Row two=20 points
Row three=50 points
Row four=70 points
Row five=100 points
Hitting Gonzo=300 points
Destroying all the chickens=1000 point bonus

If you select First Mate Piggy, you play Pastaroids. Somehow, Piggy has been ejected from the Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the bottom of the screen to the top and board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will lose ground, and thus time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't dawdle.

Scoring
Karate-chopping a meat ball=100 points
Boarding the Swinetrek=1000 points

If you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The Swinetrek has gotten trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The Gonzoids are standing on ledges, throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the Boomeray. When you fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life.

Scoring
You get one point for every mile you get through the mine.
Hitting a Gonzoid=100 points
Escaping the mine=1000 points

The difficulty switches do nothing. The only game selections are one player or two player, alternating.</desc>

Poisonous frogs, eels, scorpions, bats and other hazards get in the way. Pitfall II is the sequel to Pitfall, the original platform game. Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint.</desc>

	<desc>Pitfall! is a platform action game. You play Pitfall Harry who is on a quest to locate treasure deep in the jungle. With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!</desc>

Your ship flies to the left, while you control you up and down motion. Initially, you must shoot the oncoming lager, red ships but avoid the smaller, blue missiles. Do not shoot the black ship. Dock with it so you can land and refuel later. When you come to the three enemy fuel depots, shoot each one to destroy it then make your way through a mine field to continue. If you come to the landing strip, just align your ship with it to land and a refueling truck will top off your tanks. As you move into night, the enemy ships become too dark to see. You can then create light, temporarily, by firing off shots.</desc>
	<path>./Plaque Attack (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In Plaque Attack, your goal is to protect a mouthful of teeth from a variety of incoming foods! You control a tube of fluoride toothpaste, and you need to shoot the attacking foods before they can decay the teeth located at the top and bottom of the screen. Hamburgers, hot dogs, gum drops, strawberries, donuts, ice cream cones and more will all appear from the sides of the screen and make their way towards the teeth. If a food item reaches a tooth and is allowed to remain there for too long, the tooth will decay and disappear. The game ends when all of the teeth have decayed and disappeared.</desc>
	<path>./Pleiades (USA) (Proto).rom</path>
	<desc>This is a sequel to Phoenix. 

On the first screen, you must shoot swooping aliens while not getting shot by them. At some point, an alien will create a shield across the screen just above your ship that will require you to shoot holes through to destroy more aliens. Be aware, however, that the alien shots are not slowed at all and can still kill you.

On the second screen, you must shoot or avoid a phoenix(es) shots but the object is to shoot the alien in the mothership above. You can also shoot the phoenix(es) themselves for points.

On the third screen, you must maneuver between parked ships, without hitting any, to dock at your spot at the top. Once you do this, the game goes to the first screen only harder.

There are game selections to choose to also play only the first, second or third screens, with each wave getting harder.</desc>

You must face one to three enemy subs and one to five bombers in a squad. You must destroy the bombers by shooting missiles. After you destroy the bomber squadron, you must face a dive bomber dropping torpedoes that plunge to your depth then move horizontally. After destroying him, you must navigate through a channel, avoiding or torpedoing mines to reach the next level. Occasionally, an enemy destroyer will move across the screen and will drop a depth charge.</desc>
	<path>./Pole Position (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Pole Position is the conversion of the arcade racing game. Enter the Grand Prix, race against other racing cars to achieve the highest score possible in the shortest amount of time.

Before the player can enter the Grand Prix, the player must first qualify by competing in the Qualifying Lap within 73 seconds or less. If the player however, does not qualify in the Qualifying Lap, the player may continue to race until the Race Timer runs after 90 seconds. The player will score 50 point per 5 meters and additionally 50 points for every racing car passed. When the time runs out - Game Over. The player will have to restart the Qualifying Lap.

Qualifying will enable the player to start in one of the eight available positions. The faster the lap time was, the better the starting position in addition to bonus score points. The number one starting position, is the Pole Position.

During the Grand Prix, the player will compete against the Race Timer as well as against other racing cars. If the player fails to beat the Race Timer in any lap, the player drops out of the race - Game Over. Completing the race by reaching finishing line will grant the player 200 points per each second left on the Race Timer, bonus score for distance covered, and passing bonus points.

Scoring

1. Every 5 meters driven: 50 points
Passing Car Bonus: 50 points per racing car

	<desc>This is a game of polo, played on horseback. You move your horse with the joystick. The mallet swings automatically and will always send the ball in the direction of the opposing goal. The object is simply to to get the ball through the opposing player's goal more than they get the ball through yours. Some game variations have the ball wrap around the screen, some make the ball bounce off the sides, some give each player one horse to control, some two apiece.</desc>
	<path>./Pooyan (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home. Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground. If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig. But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig. But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too. If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit. Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair. Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall. Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present. Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</desc>
	<path>./Popeye (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Popeye is a conversion of the arcade action/platform game. As Popeye, you are trying to win Olive Oyl's love! She is at the top of the screen dropping tokens of her love, and you need to collect them before they hit the ground. After you have collected the required number of items, you can move on to the next, more difficult level. There are many obstacles trying to stop you from completing your task, though! Brutus wanders around the screen and is constantly trying to catch you. If you collect a can of spinach, you can temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus will knock you out. Other objects such as bottles or birds are also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of your lives if you are hit. Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!</desc>
	<path>./Porky's (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You play as Edward "Pee Wee" Morris, who, despite his shortcomings, strives to get revenge on Porky, the owner of the bar that dissed Pee Wee and his friends.

County Line
-----------------
You begin at the county line. You must move up from highway lane to highway lane without getting hit. You get points for dodging various obstacles on your way to Porky's.

Motor Boat=1 point
The Police=100 points
Porky's Girls=200 points
Attack Pigs=400 points
Porky's Bouncers=800 points

Last Band=3200 points

Porky's Bar
-----------------
After you get all the way to the top, you enter Porky's Bar, where you have to travel the correct path up the scaffolding, planting charges as you go. If you get to the top, there will be a detonator and so long Porky's! If you fall and Porky catches you, it is off to the swamp.

Porky catches you=lose 200 points
What points you get for exiting the scaffolding depends on the difficulty you have set the game to. The points are from 100 to 3200.

The Swamp
-----------------
If you get caught on any other screen, you end up here. You must pole vault up and release when in mid-flight to get up to one of the platforms.

The first time you are there, you have to collect bricks then place then on the wall on the other side until you can climb out. 

If you are sent to the swamp a second time, you can climb out right away but look out for Porky.

Place a brick=100 points
Getting out of the swamp screen=100 points
Each pole vault jump=lose 25 points
Falling into swamp=lose 100 points
Caught by Porky=lose a random number of points

The Shower
-------------------
Push the random object that appears at center, top into the pit at the bottom without getting caught by Ms. Balbricker or falling in the pit the climb out the top back to the county line. Every time you get through the shower, you stop or slow a lane on the highway.

You get 100 points for pushing an object into the pit.
You lose 200 points if you fall in the pit or are caught by Ms. Balbricker.
Every ten seconds you are in the shower, you lose ten points so don't dawdle.

The difficulty settings:
Left difficulty switch set to A=Shower scene most difficult
Left difficulty switch set to B=Shower scene less difficult
Right difficulty switch set to A=Swamp scene most difficult
Right difficulty switch set to B=Swamp scene less difficult

	<path>./Power Off! (France) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>You are Brian Mareck. Your father created a super computer to help mankind but when it was switched on, something went wrong. You must deactivate the computer, but beware of the robots that have been reprogrammed to protect the computer at all costs. You must run and climb ladders to get to the 'power pills' and deactivate them. Avoid the robots as they will kill you. Once you have deactivated all the 'power pills' in that part of the lab (level), it is off to the next.</desc>
	<path>./Pressure Cooker (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In Pressure Cooker, you are a cook whose job is to fullfill hamburger orders at "The Grille". Along the bottom of the screen you will see the orders for various types of hamburgers come in. Tomotoes, onions, lettuce, and cheese may all be requested and you need to collect the proper ingredients, put them on a hamburger, and drop it in the wrapping machine. The hamburgers will be coming down the left side of the screen on a conveyer belt as all other ingredients come flying out of the dispensers on the right. Make sure you catch all the ingredients and don't let any hamburgers fall off the end of the conveyer belt, otherwise you'll lose performance points! If your performance score drops to zero, you will be fired and the game ends. Of course, the ingredients will rarely come out in the desired order, so you also have the ability to toss an ingredient back without losing performance points if necessary. As you successfully create the ordered hamburgers and drop them in the proper warpping machine, the game difficulty will increase by upping the speed of the conveyer belt and increasing the complexity of the orders.</desc>
	<path>./Pressure Gauge (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>Pressure Guage's gameplay is a simple as its graphics, albeit not that easy to describe. On the left of the screen is a small colored line. On the right is a line that starts at the top of the screen and slowly descends. This is your timer. Next to the left line is a line that starts at the bottom and rises to the top. When it reaches the top, it restarts at the bottom. The object is to press your button when the rising line on the left is within the small line on the left. This will cause a new line to rise. If you press the button when the rising line is not in the left small line or let the rising line reach the top, the new line will lower. To clear the level, get the new line all the way to the top. If you do not get the new line to the top before the descending line on the right reaches the bottom, the game is over.</desc>
	<path>./Private Eye (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You are the great French private eye Pierre Touche. Your job is to capture the criminal Henri Le Fiend and send him to jail. To do this, you will first need to find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you: questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for! If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum, or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks so there will be a greater area to search! In addition to the various cases, several difficulty settings are included which control the speed of your car and how high you can jump.</desc>
	<path>./Qb (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>Explaining Qb is simple, even if achieving your goal proves not to be. You must slide blocks in the left playing field to match the pattern in the right field. You can jump from block to block, as long as they are adjacent. When you land on a block with fruit on it, you get extra points but beware of the monsters.</desc>
	<path>./Q-bert (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>
	<path>./Q-bert's Qubes (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Q*Bert's Qubes is the sequel to the game Q*Bert and features similar gameplay, but is now in three dimensions. Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.</desc>
	<path>./Quadrun (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Quadrun is an arcade style action game for one player. The planet of Quad has been invaded, and all of the "Runts" are imprisoned; your goal is to rescue them! The screen is broken up into four sectors (one on each edge of the screen), with the prison in the center. Your character is equipped with three phaser balls; on the screen you will see the captors running up and down vertically, and you need to hit them with a phaser ball. When hit, the captor will be destroyed and one of the Runts will be able to escape. The Runts will run back and forth horizontally, and you need to catch them before they run into the deadly wall at the edge of the screen. To make the game more challenging, you are only equipped with three phaser balls! This means after firing a phaser ball, you will need to quickly run around to the other side of the screen and catch it before it disappears. You will also lose a phaser ball if one of the captors collides with your character. Lose all three phaser balls, and the game is over. Also, there is a critter counter at the top of the screen; if you fail to destroy one of the captors or if one of the escaped Runts runs into a wall, the critter counter will decrease. If the critter counter runs out, the game ends.</desc>
	<path>./Quest for Quintana Roo (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You are Yucatan Sam on a quest to explore the temple of Quintana Roo. Your goal is to find the vault which is hidden somewhere within and return with the treasure that is inside. You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!</desc>
	<path>./Quick Step! (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In Quick Step a kangaroo and squirrel are competing against each other to earn points by jumping on trampolines. The screen is made up of an array of trampolines which scroll downward. As trampolines appear at the top of the screen, they will be grey in color; as soon as it turns pink, the trampoline is now in play. Each time a critter jumps on a trampoline, the color will change to that critters color (green for the kangaroo, or blue for the squirrel). If you jump on a pink trampoline, 3 points are earned; when a trampoline falls off the bottom of the screen that is your color, 6 points are earned (so although no points are earned by jumping on your opponents color, you want to try to get as many trampolines as possible your color in order to earn points when they reach the bottom).  If you fall off of the bottom of the screen, a life is lost; the game ends when one player has no more lives left and whomever has more points wins. A few bonuses can also be found; if you see a white trampoline, that is a magic hat; collect it and then jump onto the same space as your opponent to temporarily stun him. Each player also begins the game with 6 tricky traps; pressing the button lays a trap causing the trampoline to disappear so no one can land there.   Each level in the game gets progressively faster; at the end of a level, there will be a single column of fast moving trampolines to jump up, so be careful!</desc>

You start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game start back at the beginning only harder.</desc>

The player's jet is equipped with machine guns, guided missiles, and, in later levels, proximity mines, which can be used to destroy the Drones, Interceptors, Patrollers, Bombers, and other enemy fighters that the player will encounter. The jet has a limited amount of fuel, and at the end of each mission players will need to dock with the fuel tanker to replenish their fuel supply.

To help out during gameplay, there is an instrument panel at the bottom of the screen which displays your radar, fuel gauge, and weapons status.</desc>

	<desc>In Raft Rider you are floating down a river on a raft made out of logs. Your goal is to guide the raft as far down the river as possible while avoiding the many obstacles. You will come across dangerous rocks, trees, beavers (which chop down trees making more obstacles!), and even a moose, all of which can sink your raft. For each segment of river you travel 125 points are earned, and additional bonus points may be earned by collecting gold nuggets which you will encounter in the river from time to time. You begin the game with three rafts (bonus rafts can be earned), and the game ends when all of the rafts have been sunk. Several difficulty levels are available which control the speed of the current, as well as the speed of the beaver and moose.</desc>

	<desc>Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!</desc>
	<path>./Rainbow Invaders (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>It's the year 3006, and the evil Rainbow Invaders from the planet Pacco, are headed to Earth! They look like the ridiculous aliens depicted in 1980s arcade games, but are extremely dangerous and their goal is to exterminate all humans! You command a fleet of spaceships and you must defeat all of the Invaders to save Earth! Good luck!

This game is inspired by the game Space Invaders but with a twist. Yes, there are rows of invaders moving across the screen then moving down, firing as they go. Yes, your ship moves left and right at the bottom of the screen, firing up. Yes, an enemy ship will travel across the top of the screen. But there, the similarities end. For one thing, there are no shields to hide behind. Your ship does have a shield you activate by pulling back on the joystick but be warned, it drains all your energy so when you use it, after it is gone, you cannot move or fire for a second.

Also, the aliens are not dropping just electric shots. They also drop any of sixteen Special Shots. Some of these will help you, most will hinder you.

The Special Shots do the following:

1. Your ship's movements and shots become faster. Duration: ten seconds
2. Your ship's left/right movements are inverted. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
3. Your ship's movements and shots become slower. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
4. Enemies do not fire. Duration: ten seconds
5. Inavders' electric shots descend at maximum speed. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
6. Invaders' electric shots track your ship. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
7. Invaders stop moving. Duration: five seconds
8. Invaders move very fast. Duration: one second
9. All shots, your and the invaders, become invisible. Duration: ten seconds
10. If you shoot at an invader or the enemy ship and miss, a randomly generated invader could appear. And your Shoot Abort option, wherein when you shoot again the last shot disappears, is temporary disabled. Duration: thirty seconds
11. Your ship freezes. Duration: one second
12. Invaders electric shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
13. Your shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
14. Your shots dont stop when they hit an enemy but continue straight to the top of the screen, killing any enemies it hits. Duration: five seconds
15. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you dont blast it immediately, every few moments a new invader is randomly generated. Duration: thirty seconds
16. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you dont blast it before the bonus expires, your ship will explode. Duration: ten seconds. Meaning you have ten seconds to shoot that invader or lose a life</desc>

You, the Ramroid, are on a track in the center of the screen. You can aim left and right to fire. On both sides are colored bars that begin to randomly advance towards the center. You must shoot these bars to drive them back, preferably off the screen. If a bar starts flashing, it is a bonus bar and shooting it gets you larger points as well as clearing it from the screen completely. Be warned, though, that sometimes the bar will reappear on the opposite side of the screen.

A round ends when:
1. You have cleared all the colored bars from the screen or
2. The timer at the bottom, which starts at five thousand, reaches zero or
3. The colored bars have blocked off part of the screen and you clear the rods where you can

After three rounds, the game is over.</desc>

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human</desc>
	<path>./Raster Fahndung (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>You are presented with a screen full of squares, thirty-two squares wide by twenty squares high. The object of the game is to find a particular set of squares that measure six by six squares. This sounds simple but you are timed. You can view the pattern you need by pressing fire but don't stay long as this makes the timer speed up to twice as fast while you are in that screen. In a two player game, the first player to find the correct pattern collects one point. The game ends when the timer runs out or, in two player, one player reaches nine points.

You start with ninety seconds. If you select the easy difficulty, the second puzzle with have five less seconds. Time decreases per screen until you reach twenty seconds, the lowest time. On the hard setting, you have to clear as many boards as you can in ninety seconds, total.</desc>
	<path>./Reactor (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</desc>

	<desc>Terra I supplies Earth with Zenbar crystals, which is used to supply 72% of the power to Earth. Ordinarily, a computer controls the defense systems but it looks to have been sabotaged. Space pirates are in the area and the robot interceptors are working against us. Your orders are to fly your F-117 Starwarrior to Terra I, destroying anything that tries to harm you.

You can move your ship up, down, left or right. You begin with a top-down view if the F-117, facing towards the bottom of the screen. Meteors and later space pirates come from the bottom moving up and you must shoot them. After you get through these, you switch to a side view of the ship and face left or right. Robot interceptors will come from the sides and must be destroyed then fish force fields (yes, fish force fields) will come from the top, moving down and you must shoot the fish-shaped devices to destroy them. They are Terra I's last defensive line so when you get through them, you win.

In the two player games, player one controls the F-117's left and right movement and player two controls the up and down movement therefore players must work together. Firing alternates between both players in two second intervals.</desc>

Chimpanzees are harmless but orangutans can capture you and place you in a cage in the village and gorillas can capture you and/or shoot you. If you are captured, you must press your button to escape then head south to the desert. After the desert, you enter the poison caves. There are no apes here but you will lose a life point every second you are within. These caves are a maze you must get through but be advised that not all exits lead to the human stronghold. Some exits come out in the forest or desert. Once you reach the human stronghold, you will get a splash screen then your total points then you restart in the forest at a harder level.</desc>
	<path>./Revenge of the Beefsteak Tomatoes (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You must build three walls above the tomato plants at the bottom. You must also dodge tomato bombs shot by the tomato plants, shoot tomato vines that grow on any part of the wall, shoot cherry tomatoes (or just dodge their shots) and shoot or dodge beefsteak tomatoes.

To capture a brick, you shoot it once. Then to place it, you shoot vertically at the wall once. You cannot place bricks horizontally.

The game's default is level setting six, which has all enemies and each round is harder than the last. The level settings are as follows:
Level one: Tomato plants only and every round is the same difficulty
Level two: Same as one but adds beefsteak tomatoes
Level three: Same as two but adds cherry tomatoes
Level four: Same as three but adds brick-growing vines
Level five: Same as three but each round gets harder than the last
Level six: Same as four but each round gets harder than the last
Level seven: Same as five but the tomato bombs are wider
Level eight: Same as six but the tomato bombs are wider.

When the left difficulty switch is set to B, you have unlimited lives. If set to A, you have four lives.
The right difficulty switch affects the game speed; A faster, B slower.

The points are:
Killing the beefsteak tomato=5 points
Killing the cherry tomato=50 points
Shooting the brick-growing vine=5 points
Capturing a brick=10 points
Placing a brick in a wall=20 points
Completing the first wall=1,000 points

	<desc>River Raid is a vertically scrolling action game. You fly a jet up a river in an attempt to destroy bridges which are vital to the enemy. The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life.</desc>
	<path>./River Raid II (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You're the pilot of an F-14 assault jet, assigned to the dangerous mission of taking out an enemy bridge at the top of a heavily guarded river. In River Raid II, the gameplay is similar to the original River Raid, but with a few additions. For each mission you start out on an aircraft carrier. After a successful takeoff, you need to get past enemy forces located over the ocean which guard the entrance to the river. Make sure to collect plenty of fuel from the refueling jets, since once you reach the river fuel will become scarce! Next you will have to make your way up the treacherous river channel until you finally reach, and hopefully destroy, the bridge. But the level isn't over yet, for now  you have to return to the aircraft carrier and land safely. After completing all of this, you move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to the expanded levels, another change in River Raid II is the ability to control the altitude of your plane. You can fly high above everything, or fly low into the channel to take out enemy tanks and barges.</desc>
	<path>./Road Runner (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>This game is based on an arcade game that was released by Atari.

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.</desc>

	<desc>Robin Hood is an action game where you need to rescue Maid Marian who is being held by the Sheriff of Nottingham in a castle (and while you're at it, steal some gold to give to the poor)! Gameplay takes place on several different screens which have different objectives. First you will need to make your way through Sherwood Forest; numerous henchman are hiding here, so use your arrows to shoot them. Surviving the forest, the next section takes place outside of the castle; naturally, numerous henchman guard the castle gate. While dodging incoming arrows, you need to shoot enough of the henchman to cause the gate to open. Once it opens, you can enter the castle for the final scene. Inside the castle you will be able to find Maid Marian behind one of the many doors, and gold behind another. The rest of the doors have henchman hiding behind them, but if you can find the Maid Marian or the gold then you win this round and the game repeats at a tougher skill level.</desc>
	<path>./Robot Tank (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</desc>
	<path>./Roc 'n Rope (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides. Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points. 

Your player also cannot take a fall, except for extremely small ones unless he is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to "shake" the rope until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope. Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the player.

There are 4 distinct levels; the cliff-side, the windmill, the waterfall and the peak. Completing all of these levels will restart the game with faster enemies and power-ups located in different places.</desc>

You race along a five-lane freeway, in control of a car equipped with weapons, on a mission to destroy certain carrier cars which are causing traffic jams.  You must weave in and out of traffic at high speeds blasting slow-moving cars in your path to reach your destination.  Along the way, you must also avoid obstacles such as destroyed cars, barricades, nails, and  oil slicks on the road.  A radar tracks the enemy and warns of coming danger.

Collisions with other vehicles and objects will damage your car and cause malfunction. The car will repair itself slowly as time lapses, or you may pull over for a quick repair, but you may let your target escape if you take too long. You only have one car, and the game is over when this car is lost.</desc>
	<path>./Saboteur (USA) (Proto).rom</path>
	<desc>You are Hotot, a cybernetic life form from a serene planet in a distant galaxy. Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur.

On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly.

In Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt. Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you must destroy the warhead one-on-one.

In the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course, the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix that will try to hold you off. If you take to log to destroy the warhead, it will escape into space. Whether you destroy it or not, you will then return to the Rocket Construction Site at a harder level.</desc>

After you start the game, the whales will move from left to right along the bottom of the screen. The ship will start throwing down nets or harpoons, depending on the settings, to kill the whales. You must aim at the nets, in any direction and shoot them. After several nets/harpoons have been sent, radioactive debris will flow from the right side on the screen. This is up too high to hurt the whales but it can hurt you. You must shoot it as well. If your sub gets hit five times, the game is over. In a two-player game, one player is the sub and the other is the whaling ship.</desc>

You can carry up to six divers at a time, and when you safely return the six divers to the surface, you move on to the next, faster level. Your sub has a limited supply of oxygen; if your oxygen meter gets too low, you will need to surface to replenish the oxygen supply. If you surface with less than six divers, you lose one of the divers. If you surface with no divers at all, then your sub will explode. To make your task more challenging, numerous giant sharks and enemy submarines travel throughout the waters and can destroy your sub on contact. To help out with these enemies, you have an unlimited supply of torpedoes which can be fired to destroy both the sharks and subs. As the levels progress, the game gets faster and more enemies appear at a time.</desc>

You are a submarine along the bottom of the sea. You must sink ships with your torpedoes.

You move your sub left or right with the joystick and launch a torpedo with the button. Try to shoot past the mines as they waste torpedoes and give no points. Try to hit ships, destroyers, enemy subs and PT boats. Try to avoid hitting the white ships as these will cause your torpedoes to rebound back down. You have fifty torpedoes and ninety-nine fuel. You lose a life when you run out of fuel. After three lives, the game is over.</desc>

After a time, a tone will sound. This is when the boats on the water below you will stop moving and you need to get above them and 'make the hand off'. Be careful, though, for although the boats stopped moving, the falling items have not. In two-player games, the players alternate.</desc>
	<path>./Secret Quest (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.

You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring.

Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.

Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen. Hence, the game won't go long if you run out of energy.

Weapon energy use and damage
Energy sword=1 energy and 2 strength
Sonic blaster=2 energy and 4 strength
Particle beam=4 energy and 8 strength.

Naturally more points are awarded for targets that are further away or tougher to hit. At the top of the screen is a cuckoo clock which counts down; when time runs out, a cuckoo will eat some of your remaining ammo! To avoid this, the clock can be shot which resets the timer. Every 20,000 points bonus ammo is awarded. When all of your ammo is gone, the game is over and the score calculated.</desc>

	<desc>You must get ten parts from an orbiting factory to an incomplete space station. Unfortunately, a comet passed near Earth and left a space debris field that you will need to avoid.

After the launch, you will see the Earth being circled but four colored dots. At the bottom will be the elapsed time, remaining fuel and four indicator bars. These bars are your orbit altitudes and their colors correspond to the colors of the orbiting dots: white for the shuttle, gold for the station, red for the orbiting factory, and green for the fuel depot.

When you are lower in orbit than an item, you move faster. If you are higher than an item, you move slower. You must match orbit and location with something to dock. Once you are close to something, you switch to the maneuvering display. Now you can interact with an item or avoid it, as in the debris. If you hit something, whether debris or man-made orbiting item, you begin to leak fuel. This means you will use fuel even if you are not firing thrusters. You also have a 25% chance to damage the part in the cargo hold.

Game variations
The difficulty switches and select switch are not used. After you press fire on the joystick, move the stick up or down to select the difficulty level, from 0 to 3. Game 0 has no space debris.

There is no score, just the amount of time it takes you and whether or not you got all ten parts in place without running out of fuel.</desc>
	<path>./Sinistar (USA) (Proto).rom</path>
	<desc>An unreleased prototype of the classic arcade title.

The player pilots a lone spacecraft, and must create "Sinibombs" by shooting at drifting planetoids and catching the crystals that are thereby released. Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. At the same time, enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Meanwhile, enemy warrior ships can also directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.</desc>

Each level in this action game consists of two screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.</desc>

	<path>./Skeleton (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>You hear faint footsteps, so you follow the sound through the 
maze. To your horror, you discover the source of the footsteps 
is a Skeleton; and it doesn't look friendly. Acting quickly, 
you blast it with your Undead Disintegrator and the Skeleton 
vanishes in a flash of colour. But as you reload your UD, you 
hear footsteps again; and you wonder; are you the hunter or the 
hunted in this nightmare?

This game was inspired by the TRS-80 CoCo game The Phantom Slayer. In this title, you move through a maze, searching for skeletons. Find them before they find you. Once you encounter a skeleton, press a button to disintegrate it. There are ten skeletons per maze and eight mazes in total.</desc>

	<desc>In Skiing, your goal is to ski to the bottom of the mountain in the shortest time possible. The mountain is treacherous with plenty of trees and moguls in the way! There are two different modes of gameplay. In slalom mode, there are a series of gates you need to ski through; missing any will result in a penalty to your time. In downhill mode you just need to ski to the bottom as fast as possible. Each mode includes five different skill levels which affect the length of the course (and the number of gates in slalom mode.)</desc>

	<desc>Sky Diver is an action game for two players. The goal is to score the most points by jumping from a plane, opening your parachute,  and guiding your sky diver safely to a landing pad. The longer you wait to open your parachute, the more points you earn for a successful landing, but don't wait too long or your chute won't open at all! For each jump, there will be varying wind conditions which blow your sky diver off course. A wind sock at the bottom of the screen will help you determine the wind speed and direction so you can compensate. There are nine jumps total, and the player with the most points at the end wins.</desc>
	<path>./Sky Jinks (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Fly slalom around pylons (right of the red ones, left of the blue ones). Avoid skipping a pylon, hitting the pylons, trees or hot-air balloons. Try to get the best time you can. If you fly to the wrong side of a pylon, you will get a three second penalty for each missed pylon. The total number of pylons remaining is at the top of the screen above the time. If you hit a tree, pylon or balloon your plane will crash to the ground. You will not die but this will hurt your time as your plane has to take off again. Hitting a pylon will not hurt your pylon count. You will still get credit for the pylon but will lose time as your plane was slowed. You can press the fire button to throttle up or release to throttle down. Move the joystick left or right to turn. You bank into turns so you need to time turns as it is not instant. Up and down on the joystick do nothing.</desc>
	<path>./Sky Skipper (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You pilot a plane and must rescue animals from cages where they were placed by gorillas. To do this, you fly over a gorilla and drop a bomb, knocking the gorilla off its feet. Once this is done, the animals will be out of their cages and you just touch each one to rescue it. The animal cages will only be open for a limited time, then the gorilla will get back on its feet. You must then knock it down again.

You mustn't take too long rescuing the animals or you will run out of fuel. If you run out of fuel, run into a gorilla or the course walls or, strangely, a cloud, you lose a plane. You begin the game with four planes.

Difficulty switches
Set to A for faster plane, set to B for slower plane.

Game variations
Game 1...Tricky flying course
Game 2...Tricky flying course and clouds
Game 3...Tricky flying course, clouds and faster plane.

Scoring
Knock a gorilla of its feet=10 points
Rescue any one animal=100 points
Rescue one of each of the four types of animals, consecutively (1 cat, 1 turtle, 1 rabbit, 1 duck)=500 points

You get an extra plane every 10,000 points.</desc>

	<path>./Slot Racers (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>The goal of this two-players console game is to move your vehicle in a maze so you can shoot missiles at your opponent without getting shot at. 

The games features four different mazes to choose from, each faster than the last. Another feature lets you decide to make the missiles faster or slower than the car. The difficulty switch determines whether you can shoot a missile while one of your own is still on the screen. Otherwise, your missile has to hit the enemy or be retrieved by your vehicle before you can launch another one.

You steer your car with a joystick. Each time you hit your enemy with a missile, you get a point. The fist player to get 25 points is the winner.</desc>

	<desc>Smurfette has been kidnapped and is being held atop a platform in Gargamel's castle. The player controls a smurf across the screen and must jump over obstacles, away from spiders, eventually up to smurfette to rescue her. Completing of this task restarts the game with faster moving obstacles and it also takes longer (more scenes) to get to Gargamel's castle.</desc>
	<path>./Smurfs Save the Day (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In this children's learning game, you learn music, sorting and color mixing.

With Harmony Smurf, the computer will play four, five or six notes and you must repeat them. After the notes play, they fall to the ground and you must put them in their correct spots. The highest level has invisible notes, you must match by sound only.

There are two modes, changed by the select switch.
In Game Mode, the computer plays and you must duplicate it. In Toy Mode, there are six notes on the ground and you can make any tune you like, the computer doesn't create a tune.

With Handy Smurf, items will move along a conveyor belt and you must sort them into one of three bins. You press the button to close or open gaps to guide the object but don't press too soon or the gap returns to the way it was before after a short time.

In Game Mode, the first five items are sorted by shape, the next five by size and the next five by color then the sequence repeats only faster. In Toy Mode, after each item is sorted, the sorting criteria (shape, size or color) changes randomly.

With Greedy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf has a colored liquid in a glass. Using blue, red, yellow and white spigots, Greedy must put the same color liquid or mix liquids to get the same color in his glass. If he gets it right, he and Clumsy drink up. If he gets it wrong, the glass drains out.

In Game Mode, the colors start easy and get progressively harder. In Toy Mode, the color selection in Clumsy's glass is random.

There is no time limit or penalty if you get something wrong.</desc>

As it becomes colder and colder, I want nothing more than to store some nuts in my caves, lest I should be no more after the winter.  But why in the world is that greedy snail always hiding somewhere to rob me of my nuts, just like those highway men?  See what a dilemma I am involved in?  To keep away from that cunning snail, should I go on carry the nut to my cave or gather a newly ripe one?</desc>
	<path>./Sneak 'n Peek (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Sneak 'n Peek is a computerized version of the game hide and seek. The game is played by two players (or one player against the computer); one player will close his eyes while the other player hides somewhere. After the second player is hidden, the first player needs to locate him in the shortest time possible. After the second player has been located, the roles will then be reversed. The game takes place in an old house with three rooms available as well as the front yard to hide in; each of these four locations contains five different places to hide. The game can be played with fixed or variable hiding locations; in the fixed game, the hiding locations will always be found in the same place, and the variable game will move the hiding places around each time a room is entered. Two difficulty levels are available; in the tougher setting, the entrance to the hiding places is narrower making it tougher to find.</desc>

	<desc>Oh, no! The Evil Queen has created a poison apple and wants to give it to Snow White! We, the seven dwarfs, have to find Prince Charming so he can save her!

You play as one of the seven dwarfs. First you move through your diamond mine, collecting diamonds. You can collect up to twelve diamonds but you must collect one ruby to leave the mine. In HARD setting, avoid obstacles and falling rocks.

After you grab the ruby, you must cross a river on a log. In the HARD setting, beware of the bat that will try to drop rocks upon you, You can press your button to use a diamond's magic to scare away the bat for a short time.

After the river, you must make your way through the forest without getting grabbed by the evil trees. In the HARD setting, you must also be careful of the bat dropping rocks. You can, again, use diamonds to drive it off. You must hit the flashing white line to exit the forest. After this, you return to the screen with all the dwarfs lined up, dancing, while the Evil Queen is driven away from Snow White.</desc>
	<path>./Solar Fox (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In Solar Fox, your mission is to guide a space ship though a solar cell matrix and collect as many of the solar cells as you can. When all of the cells in a matrix have been collected, you move on to the next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer; if you collect all solar cells before this timer runs out, you will earn bonus points and skip ahead a level. The game ends when you have lost all of your space ships.</desc>

	<desc>You are salvaging for fuel in the far reaches of the galaxy when you spot an artificial sun in the area. You need that fuel before you run out but watch out for colliding with that sun.

You start on the screen with the artificial sun bouncing around and a fuel item on the right. You must grab the fuel before your ship is out of fuel, as it uses fuel at an impressive rate. If you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Beware of the sun as its touch is instant death. After every two fuels you grab, the pace picks up. You can accelerate by pressing your button.</desc>
	<path>./Solar Storm (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Solar Storm is an arcade style action game where you control a spaceship to defend your home planet. Deadly Deltoid ships will be flying in trying to destroy your planet; in addition to this danger, a far off sun has exploded sending debris towards you. Your job is to shoot everything that is heading your way before it reaches your planet (the bottom of the screen). Each time an enemy ship or some debris makes it past you, your planets shield absorbs the energy and heats up; if it overheats, it will be destroyed and the game ends. If your laser ship crashes into any incoming danger, you lose a life (the game also ends if all lives are lost). Every 500 points there is a bonus screen where you have a chance to earn more lives. The longer you last, the faster the game will become.</desc>
	<path>./Solaris (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>The Zylons are back, and are attempting another takeover of the galaxy! Your goal is to destroy all of the Zylon fighters you encounter, rescue cadets that are trapped on Zylon planets, and to find the planet Solaris to protect it from the Zylons. Your spaceship is equipped with a galactic map which can be used to warp to different sectors of the galaxy. The map shows the location of Zylon squadrons, Zylon planets, federation starbases, wormholes, clusters of stars, and Solaris when you find it. By warping to the correct sector, you can battle the numerous types of Zylon fighters to keep them from attacking federation bases and planets. Your spaceship has a limited amount of fuel; when you see the fuel gage get too low, you will need to warp to a federation starbase to refuel (make sure you leave enough fuel to warp). When flying over a Zylon controlled planet, you will see your cadets on the surface. If you rescue all of the cadets as you fly past, you will receive bonus points and an extra spaceship. The Zylon's have many different types of fighters which you will encounter, as well as some narrow corridors with blockades which you will need to clear in order to reach new locations in the galaxy.</desc>

	<desc>This is an unauthorized conversion of the 1978 Taito coin-op game Space Invaders for the Atari 2600. Unlike the authorized Atari Space Invaders, this version has all nine rows of invaders without flicker, rather than just six. Also, the sounds are closer to the arcade game. Gameplay is the same - shoot the rows of invaders and avoid their bullets, using your bases as shields and taking out the enemy mothership when it appears.</desc>
	<path>./Space Invaders (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>
	<path>./Space Jockey (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Space Jockey is a side scrolling shooter for one player. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by having your attack saucer shoot down the varied enemies which fly by. Tanks, jet planes, prop planes, helicopters, weather balloons, and even some trees and houses will all pass by on the screen and try to destroy your saucer. You need to make sure you avoid colliding with the various enemies and their fire or one of your three saucers will be lost. Extra saucers are awarded for each 1000 points earned. Several game variations are included which control the game difficulty, the movement abilities of the enemies, and the movement abilities of your saucer.</desc>
	<path>./Space Shuttle - A Journey Into Space (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>

	<desc>Your planet has done well but your neighbors have not so they have attacked and stolen your food. It is in a space cage. You must make your way past them to return the food to your planet.

You start at the bottom of the screen, on your base. You must push up to launch from your base, at which point you will begin consuming fuel. You must then make your way through drones that are moving left or right to the space cage at the top of the screen. When you are at the opening of the cage, where the food is, push up to retrieve it. Once you have the food, you must make your way back through the drones to your base before you run out of fuel. If you die, for whatever reason, before you return to your base with the food, you must restart the level at the bottom.

If your fuel gets too low (the indicator will turn red) your ship will actually slow down. Starting with level three, you must first grab a passkey from among the drones to open the cage and then go get the food and return.</desc>

	<path>./SpaceMaster X-7 (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You are an assault ship that was designed to destroy Hyperion military bases.

You must shoot the bases enough so that the energy meter at the bottom goes from the "+" to the "-". Once the meter gets to "-" the base will explode.

Obviously, the base is not a sitting duck. There is a force field that expands and contracts, base defenders and , in higher rounds, shields. The force field has a gap in it that you can shoot through or you can maneuver inside the field and shoot the base up close. Be careful, though, because you can get caught within the field.

If you touch a shield, the force field, the base or are touched by a defender, you lose a life.

The defenders are fireballs, heat seekers, bouncers, wanderers, and homers.

The scoring is as follows:
Destroy a fireball = 25 Points
Destroy a heat seeker = 100 Points
Destroy a bouncer = 50 Points
Destroy a wanderer = 200 Points
Destroy a homer = 400 Points

You also get 25 points for each hit you get on the base.

When you destroy the first four bases, you get 1,000 points per base; the next four, 2,000 points per base and so on.

You get a bonus ship after every second base you destroy and after every 10,000 points.</desc>

Use your web to climb the building, but be careful of Green Goblin's villians which appear in the windows trying to stop you. If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points. When you reach the top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.</desc>
	<path>./Spike's Peak (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Spike's Peak is an action game where you need to climb to the top of a mountain! Gameplay takes place on five different screens. The first screen shows you approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four different difficulty levels available.</desc>

	<path>./Spy Hunter (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>
	<path>./Squeeze Box (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In Squeeze Box your goal is to escape from prison! To escape, you will need to blast your way through the wall on either the left or right side of the screen. Once a hole large enough to walk through is formed, you can use it to escape to the next screen. To make the game more difficult, the walls are constantly growing, and if you touch a wall you will lose a life! A second game variation is included where one wall is stationary, and the second wall grows. Your goal is to shoot all of the moving multi-colored wall blocks to turn them white. A row of blocks turns white when they all of have been destroyed; the row will then begin growing again, but you will now longer be able to shoot the blocks! When all of the rows have been changed to white, you will move on to the next level. The third (and final) game variation included is similar to the second one, except that the wall behind you will also move inwards; Your goal is still to shoot your way through the left wall before the right wall catches up to you. Each variation has two difficulty levels, the tougher difficulty has twice as many blocks as the easier.</desc>
	<path>./Squish 'Em (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>Climb up the side of a series of 48-story buildings to collect suitcases full of money, while avoiding creepy monsters and falling objects that try to knock you off. Fortunately, you can strike back against the monsters by smashing them flat, by smashing them on the head. Don't linger too long, though, since they are soon resurrected, white and unsquishable. 

Squish 'Em is similar to Crazy Climber, with much faster gameplay.</desc>
	<path>./Sssnake (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You were hunting in the Amazon when you become the hunted of prehistoric creatures. You found a fortress with a large gun. Now you must avoid the snakes that enter and exit and shoot the creatures through the holes in the fortress bricks.

The snakes will slither from one side on the screen to the other then come the opposite way one level lower. You cannot kill the snake but you can shorten it when you shoot it. Your gun runs on a gun track inside the fortress walls and always shoots away from the fortress. You cannot shoot through the bricks themselves, only in between them.

Game variations
In game one, the snakes enter the screen from one side but move fast. In game two, they enter from any side but move slower. Either way, you only have one life. Player two begins after player one by just pressing the button on the right joystick. If there is no player two or after player two dies, then you must press reset to play again.

Scoring
You score one point for shooting a prehistoric creature.
You gain no points for shooting at the bricks or shooting the snake.</desc>
	<path>./Stampede (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>It's a stampede!! Your job is to round up as many of the calves as you can. The screen scrolls to the right as you chase the calves; if more than three calves get past you, the game is over. The calves all run at different speeds, and when you rope one you earn points based on how fast it was running. As the game progresses, more and more calves will be on the screen at one time, and other obstacles will begin appearing to trip your horse and slow you down.</desc>
	<path>./Star Fire (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>This is a conversion of a 1980 Exidy coin-op game.

It is a time of crisis for the Earth forces. Years of constant assault
from the EXIDY coalition have left Earth almost totally defenseless.

Intergalactic intelligence has discovered a new threat, several Exidy
freighters, protected by an armada of smaller vessels, have entered a
friendly sector of space and are advancing on Earth itself, loaded with
enough weaponry to completely annihilate the planet.

You are Earth's only hope.

Aim your cross hair onto an enemy ship and press the button to fire. Try to shoot as many enemies as you can. Once you destroy all the enemies in a sector, a warp gate appears. Shoot it to warp to the next sector. Whenever your ship gets a direct hit from enemy fire, your shield loses energy. To restore shield energy look out for, and shoot, energy diamonds.</desc>
	<path>./Star Fox (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Star Fox is a horizontally scrolling action game. You control a starship on a foreign planet with the mission of collecting valuable crystals. The crystals will be located on the planets surface or somewhere in the atmosphere. When you locate a crystal, you need to fly down into the planets atmosphere to retrieve it (be careful, your ship has limited maneuverability while in the atmosphere). Of course, your mission won't be easy; guarding the planet are numerous enemy fighters. To protect yourself from enemy attacks your ship is equipped with lasers. The game ends when all of your ships have been destroyed. Good luck!</desc>
	<path>./Star Raiders (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all of the Krylon fighters which are closing in on your starbases! There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starships energy; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shield, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the Krylon that are visible on your galactic map have been destroyed, you win this round and can advance in rank (or even be demoted if you performed poorly on a mission).  The games difficulty will gradually increase as you rise in rank from ships cook up to captain.</desc>
	<path>./Star Ship (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Star Ship contains three different arcade action games which can be played by one or two players.

Star Ship
These game variations are played from a first person point of view in your star ship. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various enemies and space debris. You have a time limit of 2 minutes 16 seconds in the one player versions. In the two player version the time limit is 4 minutes 32 seconds; for half of this time one player will be the star ship commander, and the other will control a space module and needs to dodge the star ships fire. The roles will be reversed for the second half of the time limit.

Warp Drive
These game variations are also played from a first person point of view. Your goal here is to travel as much distance as possible while avoiding the oncoming asteroids.

Lunar Lander
These game variations are played from a third person point of view. You need to pilot your star ship and successfully land on the constantly moving moon. One point is earned for each successful landing, and asteroids and other debris may get in your way and will deduct points if you crash. In the two player versions, one player controls the star ship and the other player controls the moon.

Each of these games feature several variations which control the game speed and level of difficulty.</desc>
	<path>./Star Strike (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Star Strike was clearly inspired by the Death Star battle sequence in the movie Star Wars. You fly a space craft into the enemy launch trench. Your mission: to destroy the alien station before Earth passes directly over the launch trench. You must evade the alien ships that are defending the launch trench while being sure to bomb the red "Hot Targets". The very first red target that is missed when the Earth is directly in the middle of the launch trench becomes a missile. The missile is launched and destroys Earth.</desc>
	<path>./Star Trek - Strategic Operations Simulator (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view</desc>
	<path>./Star Voyager (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Star Voyager is an action game similar to Star Raiders. You control the space ship Star Voyager from a first person perspective; your objective is to make your way through seven star portals to save the Capital Starport, destroying enemy ships along the way. On each level there will be multiple enemies to destroy; typically they appear first in the distance, then close in slowly while firing torpedoes at you. Using the Star Voyagers weapons (either lasers or photon torpedoes) you need to destroy the enemies before they destroy you. Once a star portal appears, you need to navigate your way through to reach the next level (don't crash into the portal walls, you'll be destroyed!). In addition to the main viewport, the bottom of the screen also contains a status bar which shows the number of enemies destroyed, your energy level, and a scanner to help locate enemies.

Two player game variations are also included; in these one player controls Star Voyager, and the other player can choose to either control Star Voyagers weapons or the enemy ships.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - Jedi Arena (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>In Jedi Arena, you have to face an opponent in the arena to see who is the true Jedi master. Wandering throughout the arena is a seeker which is capable of firing laser bolts. To be victorious you need to destroy your opponents shield by having the seeker fire laser bolts at it. You are armed only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well as block incoming fire from your opponent. The first player to break through the other players shield wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match! Several game options are included which control the speed of the seeker, or even make the seeker invisible.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - Return of the Jedi - Death Star Battle (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>"Death Star Battle" is loosely based on the events of "Star Wars, Part 6: Return of the Jedi". Your task is to destroy the Death Star before its construction is finished. You start the task outside the shield perimeter of the Death Star. There you'll have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the energy shield. After reaching the Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the point where you can hit the core. In the following blow up of the station you must avoid collision with Death Star debris.

After successful destruction the game will restart with increased difficulty (faster enemies, faster Death Star build up, etc).

Overall difficulty can also be adjusted before starting the game.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - Return of the Jedi - Ewok Adventure (USA) (Proto).rom</path>
	<desc/>
	<path>./Star Wars - The Arcade Game (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You're at the controls of LUKE's X-WING FIGHTER, heading straight for the DEATH STAR. Your mission: to destroy it before the EMPIRE seeks its revenge on the REBEL base. Lock your sights on attacking TIE FIGHTERS and blast them with your proton torpedoes. Race along the DEATH STAR's surface, firing on giant towers. Finally, dive full throttle into the DEATH STAR's equatorial trench. You'll need split-second timing to avoid all the obstacles as you streak through the trench in search of the main reactor. Hit it and you've blown the DEATH STAR out of existence! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.</desc>
	<path>./Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back recreates a scene from the movie of the same name. You are on the icy planet of Hoth, and Imperial Walkers are closing in on the rebel power generator. As the pilot of a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!</desc>
	<path>./Stargate (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Save the humanoids from the impending aliens in the sequel to Defender. The task is still rescuing humanoids before Landers can turn them into Mutants, while avoiding and shooting other foes, however you must now carry humanoids to safety through the Stargate of the title. 

Entering this Stargate not only warps you to the nearest humanoid in jeopardy, but can also warp you ahead (while on the first 15 levels) if you enter it with 4 or more humanoids, and give you extra lives if you warp with 10 humanoids, so there is a trade-off between guaranteeing the safety of existing humanoids, and trying to advance your position

There are more enemies on screen than ever before. The Inviso button makes you invisible to enemies, but also to yourself, so you will have to follow your bullets to work out where on the screen you are.</desc>
	<path>./Stargunner (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Players take the role of a stargunner for the Yarthae Empire. The Empire is being invaded by the Sphyzygi. The stargunner must destroy their invading ships but beware of the bombs dropped by the Sphyzygi droid, Bobo.

This game is similar to Defender without the humanoids to rescue. Players must fly around the screen, shooting any incoming ships that appear. Watch out for the satellite-like object, at the top of the screen, as it drops bombs. Play simply continues from wave after wave of ships, until the player loses their last ship.</desc>
	<path>./StarMaster (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases.   In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.</desc>
	<path>./Steeplechase (Europe).rom</path>
	<desc>This is a hurdles horse race.

The horse's names, from bottom to top, are: Lucky Devil, Absent Mind, Just Missed and Little Dictator. You play as one of the jockeys and must reach the right side of the screen first. The horse runs and hurdles come at you from the right. To jump these hurdles, you turn the paddle to set the height of the jump, as indicated by the marker on the right. You press the button to jump. The better you jump, the faster your horse goes. After 3 minutes, if no one has gotten all the way to the right, the race ends and whoever was in the lead wins.

There are 6 game variations. In games 1, 2 and 3, the distance between the hurdles is uniform with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.
In games 4, 5 and 6, the the distance between the hurdles is random with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.
The difficulty switches are not used.</desc>

	<path>./Stellar Track (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>This is an Atari 2600 version of a Star Trek game found on many college mainframes.

Like those mainframe programs, it has no graphics, only text. You use the joystick, moving left or right, to select the command you want then press the red button. You then move the joystick left or right to select set the parameters of that command, if there are any. You start by pressing Reset or Select to choose how many enemies you must kill in how many stardates. 

The commands and any settings are as follows:

Galaxy Map=a 6x6 grid that starts out empty until you do a long range scan. Afterwards, the quadrants will show a 2 digit number. The left digit is the number of aliens in the area. The right digit will either be a 1 or a zero, depending on whether there is or is not a starbase in that area. Galaxy map costs you no energy or stardates.

LR Scan=Long range scan. This will tell you what is in your quadrant and all the quadrants next to yours. If there are any enemies in your quadrant when you do an LR scan, they will attack you. LR scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.

SR Scan=Short range scan. This shows you the stars, aliens and starbases in your quadrant. You need to do this to destroy aliens and dock with starbases. Like LR Scan, if there are aliens in your quadrant, they will attack after you use SR Scan. Also, like LR Scan, SR Scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.

Warp=Warp is how you move, either from quadrant to quadrant or from sector to sector within a quadrant. You move by setting 2 settings. The first is your direction. You select a direction based on the numbers below:
8 1 2

/
7--*--3
/ 

6 5 4
Next, you select how many quadrants and sectors to move. If you want to move within a quadrant, set the left number to zero so you don't warp out of that quadrant. Warp uses stardates, energy and a turn. If you warp into a quadrant that has only you and stars, the screen will be green. If you warp into a quadrant with aliens or aliens and a starbase, the screen will be red. If you warp into a quadrant with just the starbase, the screen will be gray. You cannot warp through stars. If you try, you lose the stardate and energy but don't go anywhere.

Photon Torpedo=If you hit an enemy with one of these, just one shot kills them. You select the direction with the same numbers as warp. there must be a clear line of sight between you and the enemy; no stars. You carry up to 9 torpedoes and they can be replenished. Photon torpedoes do not cost energy or time, just a turn.

Phasers=Unlike photon torpedoes, you do not need to be directly in line of the enemy or tell the game where to fire. You just set how strong you want the blast to be, via a three digit number, and the computer fires. The closer you are to the enemy, the harder you hit. Phasers use the amount of energy from you as you fired. You also use a turn.

Status=A status report. This will tell you how many stardates, aliens, energy units and photon torpedoes are left and whether you have taken damage and to what. If you have taken damage, you will see a negative number next to the damaged item. This is how many stardates it will take to repair the item on your own. You cannot leave the quadrant if your engines are damaged. Instead, you must try to warp the number of quadrants that would take that much time. You won't go anywhere but you will repair.

If you dock at a starbase, you are instantly repaired of all damage, refueled and torpedoes are restocked. Starbases are placed randomly in the galaxy and never move or get destroyed. There are always two per galaxy. To dock, warp to the quadrant and sector where the base is, so you over the top of it.

Skill (Difficulty) switches
The right switch controls how easily you take damage. In the Expert (A) position, your chance of taking damage is twice as likely as in the Novice (B) position.
The left switch controls phaser strength. In the Novice (B) position, your phasers are twice as strong as the aliens'. In the Expert (A) position, your phasers are the same strength as the aliens'.</desc>

There are fuel depots along the course that can refill you but be warned that sometimes the enemy guns will destroy these before you can grab it.

You start with three tanks. If you run out of fuel, are shot or run into a wall or enemy gun, you lose a tank. In two player game, you alternate tanks each time you die.</desc>
	<path>./Strat-O-Gems Deluxe (USA) (Unl).rom</path>
	<desc>Strat O Gems Deluxe is a falling jewels game similar to Columns, Acid Drop, Jewel Master, Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest, among others.

Three colored gems fall from the top of the screen in a vertical pattern. You must place the gems on the growing pile so that there are three or more of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When you get three or more of the same color in a row, they will disappear from the screen. If you get a combo of three or more levels, you get a high bonus. A combo is when gems disappear and cause more gems to line up and disappear. Occasionally, three gems that change colors and have colored horizontal bars across them will appear. These will create a row with whatever gems you place them on. At the end of the level, a flashing white gem with a horizontal white bar will drop down. This will remove whatever color gem it is placed on, regardless of where they are on the screen. If the gems pile up to the line at the top of the screen, the game is over.</desc>

	<desc>Strawberry Shortcake Musical Match-Ups is a puzzle game where you try to straighten out mixed up Strawberryland characters within a given time limit. When the game begins, a mixed up character will appear on the screen and you need to change the head, body, and legs until they are all from a single character. If a complete character is correctly formed, the character will perform a dance and you will hear their musical theme; if an incomplete character is formed, the musical theme heard will be partially from each of the characters you did create. Several levels of difficulty are included which dictate the time limit and which character needs to be created. In the easier levels, the character you must create will be indicated by text at the bottom of the screen. In the more difficult levels, you must create a character based on the theme song that plays.</desc>
	<path>./Street Racer (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Street Racer is an action racing game for one to four players played from an overhead view. The screen is split into two lanes; in one or two player games, each player has a lane. In three and four player games, players must share the lanes. Each game has a two minute and sixteen second time limit, and your goal is to earn as many points as possible by the end of this time. In addition to the basic racing version, several other game variations are included as well. The games available are:

Street Racer: This is the basic race car game. Points are earned by passing other cars.

Slalom: Each player controls a skier and needs to slalom through the course to earn points.

Dodgem: Each player controls a race car and needs to avoid the oncoming obstacles. One point is earned for successfully completing the race course.

Jet Shooter: Each player controls a jet in this game. Points are earned for shooting down the various oncoming planes.

Number Cruncher: Each player controls a motorcycle in this game variation. Various numbers will appear in the race track, and points are earned by running over the numbers.

Scoop Ball: Each player controls a race car with a scoop on the front. The goal is to scoop up the balls that appear in the raceway and then place them in a computer controlled car.</desc>
	<path>./Stronghold (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>You are sent to check out an abandoned asteroid base called Stronghold. As you approach, drones are launched from the surface. It may be abandoned but apparently the automatic defense system still works.

You must shoot or avoid the drones. If the drones are cloned, and traveling in sets, shooting any drone in the set destroys all the ones in the set, if they are destroyable (see Game variations). You can move in any direction but cannot shoot straight left or right. You can shoot in any other direction, however. After you get past the drones, three shields form near the bottom of the screen. Also, interceptor and patrol ships appear. The interceptors track you and the patrol ships just move back and forth over the shields.

You must shoot through the shields while dodging these ships so you can shoot the command crawler on the asteroid's surface. Be warned, though, that once there is a hole in the shield, the command crawler will shoot through it to destroy you. The crawler tries to stay below you but it is slow. In some game variations, the Mega-Field starts to form at the top of the screen, reducing your maneuvering room(see Game variations).

Difficulty switches
The difficulty switches determine what level you will start on.
Both are set to B=start at level 1

With 8 difficulty settings there is a lot of the game to master as you must start to keep an eye on your fuel, torpedoes, radar, and enemy while avoiding depth charges as the difficulty rises.  You can fire up to two torpedoes at a time. While enemy shows go by your periscope sink as many as you can.  The periscope can turn 360 degrees and look off into the horizon or close to your sub.  Some ships move slower than others, and one of the ships moves so fast that the only way to hit it is by tracking it by radar instead of visually.</desc>

	<desc>Subterranea is a side scrolling shooter. Your goal is to locate treasure crystals within the Hexuplex Caves. Controlling your cave ranger, you need to blast the various types of aerobots which are guarding the cave. When all of the bots on a cave level have been destroyed, a passageway opens allowing you to travel deeper into the caverns. When you reach the last level of the cavern, you can collect the treasure crystal and be transported to the next (more challenging) set of caves and try for another crystal. In addition to the deadly aerobots, be sure not to crash into cave walls; these will drain your energy rapidly, especially if you hit one of the skulls. When all of your reserve cave rangers have crashed, the game is over. As you progress through the caves, they become narrower and the enemies move faster. Standard and advanced skill levels are available.</desc>

	<desc>Suicide Mission is an arcade action game similar to Asteroids. You control a microscopic submarine navigating the bloodstream of someone who has been infected by a virus. Your goal is to destroy the virus! Each time you shoot a cell infected with the virus, it will split up into smaller pieces. Eventually the pieces will be small enough that they can be destroyed. When everything has been destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult level. The game features three levels of difficulty, and you can choose one of two shooting styles for your submarine (single torpedoes, or rapid fire).</desc>
	<path>./Summer Games (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Summer Games allows up to eight players to compete in a series of summer themed Olympic events. The gameplay is similar to the other entries in Epyx "games" series. Each player can choose a country to represent, and then takes turns competing in various events to see who will win the gold medal! The game allows you to compete in all of the events sequentially, choose a few events, choose just one event, or practice an event. The events available vary slightly depending on the platform, and may include:

1. Pole vault
2. Platform diving
3. 4x400 meter relay
4. 100 meter dash

	<path>./Super Breakout (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Super Breakout features similar gameplay to the original, but with several new game variations. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. To do this, you need to use the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the playfield. There are four different game variations included. The first is 'Breakout', and plays the same as the original game. 

This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there's room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top. 

The other two games add a second paddle. In 'Double Breakout' you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.</desc>

	<desc>Super Cobra is a side scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

	<desc>You have entered a wizard's dungeons in search of the fabled Sword of Saros. You must avoid the wizard, his hunter bat and other nasties while gathering treasure. Then you must escape from the dungeons.

You begin in the maze. The narrow areas are corridors and the wider areas are rooms. You must move from room to room, avoiding the wizard and his bat, gathering treasure, items and keys. Once in a room, do not stand around as each room has a monster in it that will harm you. Some rooms have doors that have either gold or a part of the sword behind them. When you find the sword piece, it will transport you to the next level of the dungeon.

In the first two levels, you will be able to see the entire maze. On the next two levels, you will reveal parts of the mazes as you explore them. On all later levels, you will only see directly around you. If a monster touches you, you will lose life points. If you encounter the wizard, you will lose life points and will need to get through his skeletons. You will start at the bottom of the screen and need to make your way to the top. In the final dungeon, all the rooms have only unlocked doors but you will need gold to bribe the monsters so you can search the doors for the exit.

The items in the maze, and their uses, are:

1. Gold: Not a selectable item. Needed to bribe monsters in the last level
2. Gems: If you collect nine gems, you can use them to get one or more type of each other item
3. Lamp: Makes it possible to see the entire maze. Not needed for mazes one or two.
4. Potion: Restores four to seven life points. You can never have more than twenty-five total life points.
5. Cross: Makes the wizard and bat move as far from you as the can
6. Scroll: Allows you to see the wizard and bat, even if they are not in a visible portion of the maze. Not needed for mazes one and two.
7. Ring: Makes you invisible to the wizard, bat and room monsters
8. Keys: Not a selectable item. Needed to open locked doors except on last dungeon. Keys do not leave the dungeon level where they are found. When you get the sword piece, any extra keys you are carrying are lost and you must find new keys.</desc>

	<desc>SwordQuest: EarthWorld was an adventure game produced for the Atari 2600. The game play boils down to walking from room to room, finding and dropping items, beating the action stages in order to find more items, and seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you if you get the right combination of items in the right rooms. 

The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.</desc>

	<desc>You are Slinky the tapeworm. You must move about the bean patch, eating beans. Each time you eat a bean, you grow longer and the bean count goes down by one.

Beans appear randomly in the patch and you must eat them before the beetle at the bottom get from left to right to get the count down to zero. If the beetle gets to the right before you get the bean, two more beans will appear in the patch and two more beans are added to the count.

At times, Beeky the bird or Spanky the spider will pass through the bean patch. In later levels, an obstacle will appear in the middle of the patch.

You lose a life if you touch your head (yellow square) to the obstacle or the sides of the patch, touch your head to your body, or Spanky or Beeky touch your head (eat you).

The third patch is night. When you get a bean, you can see the patch for two seconds. If you need more looks, you can press the fire button for another two seconds of light but it costs you a bean.

The levels and their point values are:
Apple (5 points per bean, 50 points for the apple)
Orange (10 points per bean, 100 points for the orange)
Grape (15 points per bean, 150 points for the grapes)

Once a season, you are sent to the investment/tax shelter screen, where you must collect an icon representing an investment and then grab your portfolio (briefcase). Investments have a 50/50 chance of making or losing money. Also on this screen is a character whose color changes.

What color he is determines who he is:
Black=Eggie, the IRS agent. If he catches you, he will audit you. In these audits, you always lose. You are then taxed at 50% of your income and sent back to the income screen.There are no appeals to tax court.
Pink=Waggie, the CPA. If he catches you (or you go to him), he will charge you $1,000.00 but whatever tax sheltered investment you have, he will put you in a better one.
Green=Toodles, the registered investment adviser. If you two meet, he will put you in the best tax sheltered investment available, thus making you the most profit.

After each season, you are taxed to an amount determined by your tax shelter. The object is to have $1,000,000.00 at the end of the year after taxes.</desc>

Become a F-14 Naval Aviator undergoing seek and destroy missions while dodging and gunning enemy bogeys in deadly dogfights with your 20mm cannon and air-to-air missiles.

You cockpit comes with state of the art technology, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force: Display and main computer, Bogey Alert Indicator, G-Force Indicator, Electronic Counter Measures, and a Cannon Overheat Indicator (yes, it can overheat!)...and if your feeling up to it, give the ol'bird a boost to Mach 1.0!

The gameplay like other simulation games consists of taking off, flying, combat and landing. Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision.

Taking off and landing however, also required additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise (No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try no to run over him...yet).

Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!).

After each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.</desc>

Each round is time-limited. You play until the time runs out then you get bonus points depending on weather you lost any teeth and how many. 

Occasionally, Snack Attack will try to swoop down and grab you. If you are caught, you lose a man. 

If one or more of your teeth are in danger of being lost, indicated by it flashing, you can press your fire button to Reach toothbrush, Johnson &amp; Johnson dental floss and Act fluoride dental rinse to save that/those tooth/teeth. You get three of these cleanings to start but earn bonus cleanings every 50,000 points.

When you rescue as many survivors as you can and make it back out of the room, the floor is complete and a helicopter will transport you to the next floor. Although it isn't necessary to put out all of the fires on a floor, you will earn bonus points if you do. The higher you get in the building, the tougher the game becomes.

While this technically fulfilled his associates' obligations (thus their trip to the Bahamas), the toys--alas--still have to be painted properly.

It's now your job to clean up their mess, which means properly painting the toys in time for Santa's departure Christmas Eve. You must paint the toys as they move along five conveyor belts. Ahh, but only if it were as easy as it sounds! Toys must be painted the proper color, and some toys require two coats of paint (with different colors), and if that wasn't bad enough, some must have their coats applied in the proper order! And not that you needed the additional pressure, but you also have a daily quota to meet. You must properly paint all the toys that appear on the conveyor belts each day before the whistle at the end of your shift sounds!

Santa's counting on you to ensure that all the toys are painted correctly! Can you get the job done before Santa's sleigh is loaded up on Christmas Eve?

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The NES version adds skeet shooting, triple jump, javelin throw, high jump, and archery as events but loses the hammer throw event. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If you want to go to the next event or round then you will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

Enemies will come at you three at a time, and will throw discs at you. You must keep moving to avoid them while also firing discs right back at them. There are different doors you can enter that will teleport you to another part of the room, giving you a chance to catch the enemies off guard.

There are two skill levels, and the higher your score, the harder the game becomes. Do good, and your enemies will move faster, become more accurate, and the discs will go much faster.</desc>
	<path>./Tunnel Runner (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Tunnel Runner" is an advanced 3D Maze Game, essentially what a 1st person version of Pac-Man game would be like.  Because Tunnel Runner was designed with a built-in expanded memory chip (RAM Plus!), it's 12KB of memory gives it the ability to present the maze in three dimensions.  Therefore, the playfield is a colorful, three-dimensional maze, so you never see yourself... just the walls on either side of you that form the corridors you travel along.  As you move along the passage-ways, additional tunnels appear on either side, which you can turn into by pressing left and right.

Your primary goal is to locate and collect the hidden key, located in a different spot within each maze. Through the assistance of a MAP, you can maneuver within the maze. While attempting to locate the key to exit the level, you must also avoid the hungry Zots. You will discover these enemy creatures throughout the maze. Successfully recovering the key without being intercepted by the Zot's opens the portal to the next level. As you pass each level, you will discover that the complexity and difficulty increases, while your MAP gradually reveals less and less information ultimately, your map will be of little use, requiring you to survive solely by instincts and quick thinking!</desc>
	<path>./Turmoil (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of Turmoil is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.

The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds. The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them. Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel. This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway. In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it. If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points. If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.

When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships. If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship. In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time. You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens. There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level. This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.</desc>

	<desc>Vanguard is an arcade style shooter for one or two players. Your goal is to pilot your spaceship to the City of Mystery which is located at the end of a heavily guarded tunnel, and once there destroy the creature Gond. The tunnel is broken up into several different zones, called the mountain zone, rainbow zone, stick zone, stripe zone, bleak zone, and City of Mystery. Each zone features different types of enemy spaceships to deal with, and can scroll either horizontally or vertically. In the mountain zone or stripe zone, you may also come across an energy pod marked with an 'E'. If you fly through this, your ship temporarily becomes invincible to the deadly cave walls and numerous enemies which are trying to stop you. When not invincible, your space ship is equipped with lasers to help destroy enemies. You can fire in four different directions, however your speed is decreased when firing. You also need to keep an eye on your fuel gauge; your fuel will deplete at a rapid rate, and your ship will crash if it runs out. Fuel is gained each time you destroy an enemy, so make sure you destroy as many as you can! When you finally make it through all the various zones of the tunnel and defeat Gond, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>

	<desc>In this classic game of checkers you can play with your friend or many different levels of computer AI.  Mastering all of them will take skill and strategy, as well as a bit of luck.  Video Checkers follows the standard checkers rules with the following rules: if there is a jump available, you must take it and if you get to king's row and are promoted, you cannot move again that turn but must wait for your next turn.

Game variations
Games 1 through 9 are regular checkers, from easiest to hardest in which the object is to capture or block all your opponents pieces.
Game 10 is a two player game. 
Games 11 through 19 are giveaway checkers, from easiest to hardest, in which the object of the game is to lose or be unable to move any of your pieces.

	<path>./Video Chess (USA).rom</path>
	<desc>This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.

To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.

Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square. To carry out the en passant, you must advance your
pawn to the fifth rank. Your opponent then has the option of moving
his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two
squares. If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.

Skill levels
These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.
Level 1=15 seconds
Level 2=30 seconds
Level 3=45 seconds
Level 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds
Level 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds
Level 6=12 minutes
Level 7=10 hours

	<desc>Video Olympics is an action game containing numerous variations of the game Pong. Two players (or one player against the computer) control paddles on the screen and attempt to prevent a bouncing ball from getting past them. In the most basic game variations, each player has a single paddle and there are no obstacles on the screen. The other game variations add paddles and obstacles, and some are loosely inspired by various sports and change the playfield around, but the goal remains the same: hit the ball past your opponents paddle into the goal to earn points. A few of these variations are:

1. Foozpong: Each player controls multiple paddles which are arranged somewhat like a foozball table.

2. Soccer pong: Each player controls two paddles (representing one goalie and one player) and the goal is much narrower.

3. Hockey pong: The playfield is set up to resemble hockey; the goal isn't at the very edge of the screen, so the ball may bounce behind and around the goal.

4. Quadrapong: The goals are located along the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the screen. This game is played by four players, two per team with one person defending each of the four goals.

5. Handball pong: There is no goal, and two players take turns hitting the ball against a solid wall to earn points. One point is earned each time your opponent is unable to return the ball.

6. Volleyball pong: The screen is set up like a volleyball court with a &amp;quot;net&amp;quot; in the middle. Both players are along the bottom of the screen and need to bounce the ball past their opponent.

7. Basketball pong: Each player controls a paddle on the bottom of the screen, and attempts to hit the ball into their opponents basket at the top.</desc>
