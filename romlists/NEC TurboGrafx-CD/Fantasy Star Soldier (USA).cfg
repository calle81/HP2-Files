overview The special attack squad, lead by the Mother Brain, has launched an all out invasion on Earth. Take your small-scale fighter, the Neo Caesar, with its arsenal of 4 regular weapons and 2 special weapons, and send them back where they belong! In addition to the Normal Game mode in this vertical-scrolling shooting game, there are 2-minute and 5-minute Time Attack modes and a mode where high-scores can be checked. Normal Game is made up of 8 different stages, and in each stage (except Stage 7), a boss awaits you at the end.
