overview Legion is a horizontal shooter by Telenet and Renovation. The player takes control of a small spaceship and fights his way through a horde of enemy ships and facilities. The space-fighter starts off with a simple vulcan gun and there is a total of three powerup weapons available : vulcan-gun (red), laser (green) and homing-missiles (blue). There is also a small range of special icons, which appear every once in a while, and can either power-up the current weapon, add ground missiles or activate a shield around the ship. Finally, a smart bomb can be launched with the second action button and greatly damage everything on screen. Legion has an interesting level structure and different routes are provided at strategic points throughout the game. It is also the only shooter to play a narrative voice at the beginning of every stage, giving the game an unusual and authentic film noir touch.
