overview Pomping World is the conversion by Hudson Soft of the popular arcade game originally developed by Capcom. The goal of the game is extremely simple: The player (or 2 simultaneously) has to clean up all the huge colored bouncing spheres on screen. But, in a way similar to Atari's Asteroid, each time a ball is hit, it pops and splits in two, and in two, and so on - all in all, a standard ball can split up to eight times. And if a ball, even tiny, hits the player then he loses a precious life. The player can use several weapons to pop them up, from standard vertical Harpoons to fast Laser-Guns. But the player must watch out for the small creatures that wonder around the play field and that will freeze the active weapon for a short amount of time. Power-ups of course appear from time to time to help our bubble-buster in his journey, such as freeze-time options and special hook that can stick to walls. The game is divided into different group of stages which all represent a different location in the World like the Taj Mahal or Paris. (this feature certainly reminds us of Capcom's Street Fighters).
