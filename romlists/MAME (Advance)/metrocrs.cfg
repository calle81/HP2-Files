overview A single player runs through a number of futuristically-themed levels, avoiding obstacles - Coca-Cola cans, barriers, green floor tiles (which slow the player's progress), holes etc. - and attempt to reach the finish line before the tight time limit expires. Progress is aided by springboards - which allow the player to jump over obstacles - and a skateboard, which is unaffected by the green tiles that otherwise slow the player's progress. Bonus points can be earned by kicking the static drinks cans that can be found throughout each level.
