overview It is quiet now. The Inca Huayna Capac has foreseen it all. Although death is imminent, he is at peace for he knows that the Three Great Inca Powers - time, matter and energy - are safe, sent into space, out of reach of the conquistadors. So Chosen One, go forth. Take your gallant ship and soar through the heavens. Use your nine sacred jewels for combat and locate the Powers. Be just! Be swift! Have courage!
