overview The objective in Off The Wall is to score the highest number of points. Play against another player or try to beat your best score. Score points by using the ball to knock bricks out of the wall, hitting the dragon beyond the bricks, or catching the Mystery Token for bonus points. When the player clears four brick waves, he automatically advanced to the next skill level.
