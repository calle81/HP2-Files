overview Acrobat Mission is a vertical shooter published by Techiku and conversion of UPL arcade game of the same name originally released in 1991. In the year 2100, humanity has to leave Earth due to the consequences of environmental degradation. Humans have decided to move to Mars and they left behind a bio-computer in charge of preparing the blue planet for future recolonization. But soon, an armada of hostile flying objects attack their settlements on the red planet. The defense agency decides to immediately assemble an attack force to neutralize the invasion - the operation, which is dubbed Acrobat Mission, is on! The player takes control of the 2TV-00836 Icarus, a fast space-fighter, which comes equipped with a Standard laser. Two more weapons are available throughout the game - the wide shot (W) which spreads out in front of the ship and the Hurricane shot (H) which fires clusters of rotating balls of energy. Holding the fire button charges up a special attack and each weapon features a different energy blast and damage factor. The ship can also hold a maximum of two smart-bombs, one under each wing - although they can be activated by the player, they also do fall off easily and can be detonated by enemy shots. Interestingly, the Icarus can't collide with other ships or any part of the scenery - instead, it bounces off and only suffers damage from enemy shots. However, once the shield is depleted, the ship will fly out of control for a few seconds and grant the player a last chance to inflict damage to any remaining enemies.
