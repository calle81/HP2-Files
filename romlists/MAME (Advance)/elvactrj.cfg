overview Terrorists are on the loose and it is up to a special counter-terrorism squad to infiltrate their strongholds to snag information and terminate them before it's too late. Features excellent graphics and sound, three selectable characters, an expanded arsenal of weapons and an excellent challenge. Definitely improved over the last game and highly recommended for Rolling Thunder fans!
