overview The King Of Dragons is a side scrolling Beat 'em up and is one of Capcom's long series of side-scrolling beat' em ups that flooded the arcades back in the 1990s. This title is however rather unusual and takes place in a fantasy world populated with beefy warriors and evil dragons. The world is devastated by a red and ferocious dragon and the game spreads along no less than fifteen stages. Five playable characters are available from the start : the strong warrior, the cleric, the magical wizard, the light elf and the heavy dwarf. Obviously, each character has its own strengths and weaknesses and they can receive various upgrades throughout the game in the shape of new weapons, shields or new staffs. They can also level-up and consequently increase their life bars. Heroic fantasy games wouldn't be complete without magic, and magic there is - simple lightning bolt attacks can be triggered by any player and can damage several enemies at once. It is interesting to notice that a two simultaneous player option is available.
