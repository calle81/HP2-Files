overview Back in 1987, Taito's original game hit arcades like a storm. In the game, players take control of a single armed soldier who's mission in life is to infiltrate the heavily defended enemy territories and rescue as many Prisoners Of War, or POWs, as possible. Unlike many shooter back then, Operation Wolf offers a subjective view of the scene. This feature does not sound like much nowadays, but back in 1987, First Person Shooters (known today as FPS) were far from being the norm. The scenery is shown through the eyes of our valiant soldier and the screen automatically side-scrolls while hundred of enemy soldiers throw anything they have at him. In order to protect his life, he is equipped with a Uzi gun and a grenade launcher with a limited stock of ammo. And watch out ! Not everything on screen must be shot, and characters like nurses or children will dramatically lower your life. Bonuses are of course available, sometimes just laying on the ground and sometimes hidden inside small running animals (do no ask me why) or coconuts. The most common items are ammo, but our soldier will also find rockets, drinks and special items like the ammo-unlimited free gun or the dynamite which will vaporize every single enemy on the screen. Finally, a two simultaneous player mode is available.
