overview Combatribes is a side-scrolling fighting game by Technos, conversion of an arcade game. A group of three fighters, the 'Combatribes', decide to challenge the local gangs of New York City and to eliminate their most wanted leaders. The Cyborg Martha Splatterhead, the worst of all, has united the gangs and must be stopped. Berserk, the blond of the group, is average with moderate speed and strength, Bullova is the slowest but features more health and power and Blitz is the most agile and trades off a reduced health and power for greater speed. Our trio uses traditional fighting moves such as Punches, Kicks and Throws. They can also hit enemies on the ground, jump in the air and fall on their backs or smash their heads together. Flying Throws can also be triggered by grabbing opponents from the ground and spinning them around by the legs - the stronger the fighter is, the more spins he does and the more damage he can inflict on the surrounding foes. Combatribes features six stages, called 'acts' and each one of them takes place in a different location. Each area is rather short (a couple of screens long) and the stage's boss usually shows up when all his minions have being taken care of. At the end of each level, a password is given to the player to unlock new fighters (mainly game's enemies) from the versus mode. Unlike the original arcade version, Technos threw an extra Versus fighting mode in this conversion. Controls are also slightly different in this mode - shoulder buttons can block and fighters can throw fireballs at each other.
