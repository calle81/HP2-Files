		<desc>Based around a classic motor car race from either side of the war, 1000 Miglia (literally '1000 miles') is an unusual racing game. You have to progress across Italy through a number of stages in your rickety 20s car. Keeping within time limits at each point is crucial to staying in the game.

At the beginning of the game, you can choose the spare parts that you will take with yourself in case your car breaks down. You also choose a car and set up the skills for your two drivers; you can distribute points between Skill, Resistance and Mechanics, and choose the driver's favorite part of the race.

Atmospheric conditions change throughout the race: sometimes the weather will be clear, sometimes you'll have to drive through rain or mist. During the race, your car will sometimes lose a wheel or need other repairs. If this happens, you'll lose a couple of minutes repairing it - as long as you have the appropriate spare part; if you don't have one, it's game over! Source: MobyGames</desc>

		<desc>Trade goods between ports all over the world in this economic simulation game.

As a 19th century merchant newcomer, the player need to buy a ship, find a crew, load a few goods on the ship, and sail into the horizon, until the player reaches a port with a demand for said goods. Eventually will have the money to buy more ships, create regular trade routes, and become the head of a regular trading company.

1869 focuses on management and economy, rather than action. Actual sailing is done by plotting a route and then watching the days go by, interrupted only by the occasional random event. Basically you'll be planning routes, watching out for special assignments (that pay well if completed on time) and generally trying to steer clear of the shores of bankruptcy.

		<video>./snap/1943.mp4</video>
		<desc>The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese air fleet that bombed the American aircraft carrier, pursue all Japanese air and sea forces, fly through the 16 stages of play, and make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 of these stages consist of an air-to-sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as the stage boss), while 5 stages consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese bombers with a mother bomber at the end.

As in 1942, players pilot a P-38 Lightning. Controls are also similar: button 1 fires main weapons, and button two performs two special actions: a loop maneuver like in 1942, or one of three special attacks in exchange for some of the player's fuel. Indeed, players now have only one life, in the form of a large "fuel" meter; constantly depleting, but refillable by collecting various powerups (chiefly "Pow" icons). In 2-player mode, when both players overlap their planes on screen, the energy bar can be transferred from the player with more fuel to the player with less. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a new main weapon.

There are cheat codes, different for every stage, ranging from holding down a fire button or pointing the joystick in certain direction, player(s) are rewarded with fully upgraded weapons.

		<desc>Sharkey's 3D Pool is one of the earliest 3D cue-sports games, featuring a fully-rotating table and variable viewpoint allowing for much more realistic shot-playing than the traditional top-down game style (although the game can be played this way instead). The pace, spin and angle of each shot can be set up precisely before playing it. Both 8-ball (pot your seven colors plus the black to win) and 9-ball (pot the 9-ball with a shot that also hits the lowest remaining ball, whatever that may be) are included.

There are seven skill levels to work through. A trick-shot mode is also included, with 20 pre-set shots. Prior to each match it is possible to bet on the outcome.

		<desc>A-Train is a series of train simulation video games that were originally developed and published by Japanese game developer Artdink in Japan. The first game in the series was published in 1985. The first release in the United States was Take the A-Train II, published in 1988 by the Seika Corporation under the title Railroad Empire. However, the most well known U.S. release is Take the A-Train III, published in 1992 by Maxis as simply A-Train.

The game was tremendously popular in Japan, thus motivating Maxis to license it for US distribution as A-Train, available for DOS, Macintosh and Amiga platforms. It was released in October 1992, though it sold poorly. Even the release of an add-on pack for the game failed to stir up any real support amongst the gaming community. The game was the first major failure from Maxis.

The goal is to find five Roc's eggs hidden among the destroyed scenery. Once an egg is discovered, the two monsters fight for possession of the egg in a one-on-one battle. When five eggs are found, the monsters make their way to the volcano, working their way around the lava flows to reach the top and claim the Golden Egg for the ultimate victory.

In the real-time combat sections you must choose weapons and spells instantaneously, using the mouse-based interface. You will find many villages along the way, and you can gain clues and buy supplies at these. The game's difficulty is pitched at experienced role-players; ideally those with an experienced party from the first game to load in.</desc>

The Addams Family is a platform game based on the 1991 movie of the same name released by Ocean Software in 1992. The game was released for the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis, Super NES, Amiga and Atari ST.

Ocean released several other versions of the game for other platforms, featuring different levels and gameplay. One version was released for the Sega Master System, Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Game Gear, with the latter ported by Acclaim Entertainment. A third title was developed for the Game Boy, and a fourth was produced for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum home computers.

In all versions, players control Gomez Addams as he attempts to rescue other members of the Addams family.

The game follows the Addams Family father and husband, Gomez Addams, as he attempts to save the members of his family who have been kidnapped. They have been stowed away in various locations in the mansion and are protected by a boss of some sort. The manservant Lurch and the severed hand Thing are the only characters not to be kidnapped. Thing will provide hints on gameplay whenever Gomez finds one of his red boxes marked with an 'A' for 'Addams'.

Gomez starts outside the front door of the mansion. Inside the house, Gomez can move from level to level in basically any order. The player will soon discover that the mansion is full of secrets, hidden passageways and side levels and bosses (for the purpose of increasing Gomez's health).

Gomez dispatches enemies by simply jumping on their heads (similar to the Super Mario games). He can also find objects to throw at them, such as golf balls.

The game did not have a save system but, instead, bore a password system. Through progression of the game, the player would receive passwords, enabling him or her to start where they left off.

		<desc>Adrenalynn is a futuristic, action-oriented sports game. Artificial Intelligence took over Earth and the winner of the "Adrenalynn" championship may decide humanity's future. So naturally the player participates with the goal to win the major league (there are overall three with increasing difficulties). The game itself is a bit like indoor soccer with four athletes (armed with guns) and on a smaller playing field with bumpers. A match lasts 120 seconds and there are various power-ups to collect. Each player only takes control over a single athlete. The sportsmen show up on the screen as balls.</desc>

		<desc>Advanced Destroyer Simulator (ADS) is a naval combat simulation set in World War 2. It was the first naval simulation to use real-time filled 3D graphics. Its style and mechanics are reminiscent of Epyx's Destroyer (1986).

ADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard respectively, and a sonar to detect and track submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla.

There's no campaign, gameplay is mission-based and set in three scenarios (two in the CPC version) with five mission each: The Mediterranean around Sicily, the English Channel between UK and France, and the North Sea coast of Norway. Objectives include seek-and-destroy assignments, patrols, convoy escorts, submarine hunts and blockade runs. Each scenario also offers an open “Delta” option where you cruise and hunt without specific objectives.

You navigate the destroyer manually, in real-time and from a first person perspective, though with the help of a scenario map. ADS simulates ship combat as a close-quarter exchange of torpedoes and cannon fire. In proximity to enemy land bases, Stuka fighters can attack and must be shot down with the cannons. Submarines are tracked with the sonar and can only be attacked once they surface. Enemy vessels include freighters, tankers, torpedo boats, destroyers and cruisers. Most missions are time critical; in the course of the mission, it may be necessary to dock in allied ports for repairs, to refuel and restock on ammunition.</desc>

Seven small 'toolkits' to build from include Sci/Fi, Spy, and Medieval setting templates, plus two complete games are included as a demonstration: Rivers of Light is based on Sumerian mythology and contains 140 rooms and Land of Aventuria consists of seven mini adventures with different settings, e.g. an adaption of Alice in Wonderland or a Nazi castle.</desc>

		<desc>The Adventures of Robin Hood is a video game released in the autumn of 1991 by Millennium Interactive.
The protagonist, Robin of Loxley, is robbed of his castle by the Sheriff of Nottingham and has to get it back with the help of Maid Marian, Little John, Will Scarlet and Friar Tuck.
The gameplay can be described as an action RPG. The player controls Robin as he robs from the rich to give to the poor, adventures through Sherwood Forest, defeats the sheriff's henchmen, gathers special objects and saves peasants. Heroic acts increase Robin's popularity among NPCs. Archery plays an important role in gameplay.
The isometric interface developed for The Adventures of Robin Hood by Millennium Interactive is similar to the interface used in Populous. Robin Hood's interface was later used for Rome: Pathway to Power.

		<desc>Agony is a shoot 'em up but with a surreal-fantasy background. It features an owl (the company logo) flying its way through six worlds filled with monsters. The owl uses various waves of echo-location which the player fires at the enemies.

According to the manual backstory, the sun-wizard master Acanthropsis discovers the "Cosmic Power" with a toll on his life. Before dying he teaches it to his disciples, Alestes and Mentor.

Because of memory constraints, the game features no introduction, however the game and manual mention that Alestes has been transformed into an owl, and has to pass through Mentor's traps and monsters in order to reach the Cosmic Power.

		<desc>You have been turned into a ball of air with a slow leak by an evil wizard. You must find the Spellbook and the ingredients for the spell. Without these, you will never turn back into a human again.

These items have to be collected in the maze which consists of 150 isometric rooms. These can be explored freely but sometimes you need to have special objects to proceed, e.g. a candle in dark rooms. The dangers consist mostly of sharp objects which can cause your ball to burst. Additionally you are on a timer because your balloon loses air constantly. But it can be refilled by using pumps which can be found in the maze - but you have to leave them in time or you explode because of overpressure.</desc>

		<desc>A drug baron took over Alcatraz prison and now the player takes the role of an U.S. Navy Seal to break in and neutralize him. He has two hours to complete his objectives in three buildings and needs to survive two different playing styles: side-scrolling fighting on the streets and first-person shooting inside.

Outside, the goal is to reach the building in which the objectives have to be completed. Of course the baron's thugs are not too pleased and try to kill the hero - so he has to shoot back with a many different weapons, e.g. flamethrowers, machine guns, bombs, and other destructive or close combat weapons, which can be collected from dead enemies. Similarly to Hostage: Rescue Mission, he can also hide in the background in certain spots.

Once inside a building, the game switches to a first-person view, in which the player has to navigate a maze to reach his goal, e.g. recovering evidence. To his disposal are a radar and a rifle.</desc>

		<desc>Alfred Chicken is an action-adventure game originally created by Twilight. It was released in the United Kingdom in 1993 for the Amiga, Amiga CD32, Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. It was released in the United States in February 1994 for the Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Within PAL-A regions, it was only released in the UK.

The player takes the role of a chicken named Alfred who must find his way through bizarre levels full of balloons, telephones, cheese and other strange elements. While he is on the ground, Alfred can walk, jump, and peck balloons and ground switches. While he is in the air he can dive bomb enemies or springs. Dive bombing enemies will destroy them. Dive bombing springs will bounce Alfred much higher so he can reach platforms well above his normal jumping ability. If he does not hit an enemy or a spring, Alfred will get stuck in the ground for a short time.

To complete a level, Alfred must find and peck all the balloons. The last balloon will take him to a boss fight. If Alfred dies, he starts as an egg located at the last balloon pecked.

Alfred can receive a few powerups during the game. For one power up, he must answer a telephone in secret areas to make Mr Pekles (a giant flower) give him a pot of jam. The jam gives Alfred the ability to shoot a bomb (about the size of Alfred himself) which bounces around the screen collecting things and hurting enemies. Another power up is a worm that spins around Alfred destroying enemies that it touches. You must find a can of worms to get this power up.

		<desc>Alien³ is a video game based on the movie of the same name. The plot of the movie picks up directly after the end of Aliens. Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship. Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161. Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the colony until help arrives.

The gameplay of the various Alien³ conversions varies from platform to platform. The Amiga version is a side-scrolling action game with large maze-like levels. In each level, you have to rescue all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien attacks.</desc>

		<desc>Alien Legion is a side scrolling platform shooter similar to Hewson's Exolon which was released a few years earlier. Earth has been attacked and overrun by the evil forces of Marania. All the planet's soldiers were taken as prisoners, all except one, Captain Cosmose who happens to be the player. Now it's up to him and his laser gun Sycho to save the world. Gameplay involves walking from left to right, shooting at the various enemies that appear in the player's path and jumping between platforms to find the right route and avoid falling into a pit. Enemies range from regular aliens, armoured ones, aliens riding strange vehicles to more abstract flying things. Sometimes potions appear from killed aliens, which can be either green or red. If the player touches a green potion he regains some health but if he touches a red one he loses some. When all out of health, one of three lives is lost.</desc>

		<desc>One of the few computer games recreating cricket, the traditional summer pastime in many English-speaking countries. The game had different licenses with well-known cricketers in different countries. It was Audiogenic's second cricket game, 8 years after Graham Gooch's Test Match.

All the international sides are present, with the chance to change the player data and choose the team yourself. Test match and limited-overs matches are available, with 1 or 2 innings per team, and you can turn the Leg-before-wicket dismissal off, which makes the game easier to understand.

There are 3 skill levels - Amateur, Professional and World Class. The bowling involves positioning a cursor to place the bowl, then controlling the speed/spin (depending on the type of bowler selected). Batting involves timing one of the many available shots, and fielding is largely automated.</desc>

		<desc>You are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

The Altered Beast title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in single player mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</desc>

		<desc>Amberstar was the first installment in Thalion Software's never-finished Amber Trilogy, a role-playing video game franchise. Although considerably more advanced, the game had many similarities to Thalion's earlier game DragonFlight, and was by many fans thought to be a "sequel" to this game. However, as with most of Thalion's other releases, the public interest was somewhat limited.

The game is set in the fictional world of Lyramion and begins with the player situated at the graves of his parents. As the player sets out for adventure, it becomes apparent that an evil entity named Lord Tarbos, who was imprisoned a thousand years earlier, is about to be released again to wreak havoc upon Lyramion. The player - helped by the various adventurers who join the party along the way - must recover the thirteen missing pieces of the Amberstar, the talisman that banished Lord Tarbos initially, to defeat the demon once again.

		<desc>Released at a budget price around the peak of the WWF's original popularity, the twist in this wrestling game is the tag-team nature of competition. Each player selects two wrestlers from those on offer, and when the one in the ring is weakened he can go to the edge of the ring and tag his team-mate, who then enters the ring and allows the other to recover.

You can either play individual matches (for one or two players) or a full tournament, with three rounds of variable length. There is no joystick-waggling in the control system, with a variety of kicks, throws and punches on offer using simple joystick motions. Once the players are close together they grapple - this gives you a chance to lift and then piledrive your opponent.</desc>

		<desc>A young physics professor named Lester conducts a particle experiment. Suddenly, something goes wrong, a lightning strikes, and in a moment Lester finds himself in a strange alien world. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens who escapes from the prison together with him helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.

Another World combines shooting, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. The game is divided into stages; some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. Exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. Many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. Tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat.

Typically, enemies are defeated by using an energy gun found in an early stage. The gun's regular function is shooting energy projectiles. By pressing down and holding the fire button the player can activate an energy shield which protects Lester from regular attacks, allowing him to fire from relative safety until it evaporates. Finally, by holding the fire button even longer the gun creates powerful blasts which can disrupt shields. Most enemies are equipped with similar guns and are able to perform the same actions as Lester. Fighting enemies therefore requires tactical usage of regular attacks, shields, and bombs, as well as learning enemy patterns.

Each level can be accessed by typing a code the player learns after having completed the level. If Lester dies, the level must be restarted. There is no on-screen interface and no in-game dialogue in the game. Vector graphics are used for creating the game's environments and animated cutscenes.</desc>

		<desc>Antago is a puzzle game played on a 5x5 square board. It can be played either against the computer, with a choice of up to 10 levels of difficulty, or against another human player. Other options allow you to play a match or start a training session, as well as select between "plain" (empty board) and "prepared" (pre-arranged balls on the board) game modes. A demo mode is also available, where the computer plays against itself.

An angel and a devil compete against each other, with the goal of aligning five "balls" in a row on the board, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They are moved around the board with the joystick, pushing each other as their paths cross, and strategically placing balls on the edge of the board to both disrupt their opponent's lines and try to create a line of 5 of their own balls.

Each level features different background and board graphics. There is no background music playing during the game, and only basic sound effects when the two characters push each other, place a ball on the board and win.</desc>

		<desc>Good news: the Cold War is over and the world is at peace! Bad news: Terrorists stole a few leftover atomic bombs. Now the player has to use the new Apache attack helicopter in order to destroy the four terrorist hideouts.

Apache Flight is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player spends the most time shooting enemies by using the two available weapons: the unlimited standard ammo (released by tapping the fire button) and limited missiles (released by holding the fire button) which are required to hit ground targets, e.g. cannons and tanks. Those missiles are also available in the heat-seeking variety which are automatically used up first. Fuel is limited and is constantly drained every second, but it can be refilled by hovering over fuel depots which are regularly encountered during the levels. However, when shooting them with a missile instead, the depot releases additional missiles to collect. Of course it is also important to dodge enemies and their bullets because every hit causes the loss of a life. When that happens, a new helicopter with reset fuel and missiles appears with a brief invincibility period at the point of death. The game is lost when all lives are gone.</desc>

		<desc>Arcade Trivia Quiz is a quiz game for 1, 2 or 3 players.

There are four blocks of questions. Each block contains questions in six categories;

    Art & Literature
    Science
    Music
    Film and Television
    Sport
    History & Geography

Icons representing these categories are displayed in a pyramid arrangement. The icons of available questions flash in sequence and the players must press FIRE at the correct time to select the icon of their choice. All questions are multiple choice with four answers, one correct & three incorrect, being available.
Both question selection and answering are timed and must be completed in eight seconds.

Scoring is cash based. All players start with £1.00 and each player stakes 20p per attempt. If, by answering questions successfully, a player makes it to the top of the pyramid then they trigger a 'Cash Run' feature which can earn extra money - up to £5.00.

The game also has a random Jackpot feature in which a player can choose to either to bank the cash they have earned so far or double the money but risk losing it on an incorrect answer.</desc>

		<desc>The mysterious enemy known as DOH has returned to seek vengeance on the Vaus space vessel. The player must once again take control of the Vaus (paddle) and overcome many challenges in order to destroy DOH once and for all. Revenge of Doh sees the player battle through 34 rounds, taken from a grand total of 64. 
Revenge of Doh differs from its predecessor with the introduction of "Warp Gates". Upon completion of a level or when the Break ("B") pill is caught, two gates appear at the bottom of the play area, on either side. The player can choose to go through either one of the gates - the choice will affect which version of the next level is provided. The fire-button is only used when the Laser ("L") or Catch ("C") pill is caught.
The game also features two new features for bricks. Notched silver bricks, like normal silver bricks, take several hits to destroy. However, after a short period of time after destruction, they regenerate at full strength. Fortunately, clearing a level does not require that any notched bricks be destroyed. Also, some bricks move from side to side as long as their left and/or right sides are not obstructed by other bricks.
The US version features an entirely different layout for Level 1 that feature an entire line of notched bricks, with all colored bricks above it moving from side to side. The game features a mini-boss in the form of a giant brain, which will help you practice for DOH. Some home versions of Revenge of DOH also featured a level editor, where players could create their own levels or edit and replace existing levels, with the exception of two levels: the mini-boss and DOH.</desc>

		<desc>The player controls the "Vaus", a space vessel that acts as the game's "paddle" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks. The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same.
At round 33, the final stage, the player will take on the game's boss, "DOH", a head resembling moai. Once a player reaches round 33, he must defeat DOH with his remaining extra lives because there are no continues on the final round 
The game opens with a monologue stating the following:
"THE TIME AND ERA OF THIS STORY IS UNKNOWN. AFTER THE MOTHERSHIP "ARKANOID" WAS DESTROYED, A SPACECRAFT "VAUS" SCRAMBLED AWAY FROM IT. BUT ONLY TO BE TRAPPED IN SPACE WARPED BY SOMEONE........"</desc>

In a race against time you must choose and control up to six different vehicles, and use them to destroy enemy power lines and eventually the beam generator. And thus you save the Earth and all mankind.

Armour-Geddon is a blend of simulation and strategy, in which you get to play both the brass and the grunt. You designate your targets and choose which vehicle(s) you shall use to blow them up with.</desc>

		<desc>Army Moves is a one-player game which is divided into two parts. In part one, you drive a jeep and must avoid collision with other jeeps and being shot at by helicopters. Then, you fly around in a helicopter and the oject is to bring down airplanes without being shot at by the airplanes themselves, submarines, and any other ground fire. Make sure you land on the pad near the end.

In part two, you start out in the jungle and must jump from rock to rock without crashing into toucans (shoot at them to make them fly higher) and being blown to bits. Then you have to make your way to the general's offices shooting soldiers on the way, and finally, locate the secret documents. When you complete the seven sections of Army Moves, you'll receive a higher bonus.

Some versions have a high score table to record your achievements. The second section must be loaded seperately, using a code attained from completing part one, on some versions.</desc>

		<desc>Arnie 2 is an isometric action game. Although it's obvious to which Hollywood actor the game's name alludes, Arnie 2 is not a licensed title and not based on any movie.

It is the sequel to the Amiga / C64 platform game Arnie (1992). Unlike the previous title it has been developed in-house by Zeppelin

Fast reflexes and a lust for violence are required for success here. Your average muscleman shoots and bombs his way through four enemy-infested territories: Shut down a chemical plant by blowing up enough pipeline valves. Clear an airfield from enemy soldiers, tanks and helicopters. Climb from battleship to battleship in a hostile harbor. And finally, rescue as many prisoners as possible from a jungle POW camp.

Naturally, the levels are crawling with enemies: from simple infantry armed with rifles, mortars or rocket launchers to MG teams, missile batteries and tanks. Most of the opponents are stationary and stolidly fire in a single direction; however, foxholes spew out cannon-fodder at a constant rate. To destroy such nests or efficiently dispatch groups of soldiers, Arnie has a (limited) supply of grenades. Some deceased foes drop more powerful weapons as well as invaluable first aid kits and extra lives.</desc>

		<desc>Assassin is a video game for the Commodore Amiga system. It was developed by Psionic Systems and published in 1992 by Team 17. The game is an action game that has platform and shoot 'em up type gameplay. Assassin was updated and re-released in 1994 as Assassin: Special Edition.

Assassin's storyline is fairly simple. The character is an assassin that has been hired to kill the antagonist of the game, "Midan". He is then dropped behind enemy lines and must first disable Midan's power source, and then assassinate him. The assassin is armed with a boomerang that is razor-edged.

There are three skill levels to Assassin, Rookie, Arcade and Ultimate. As well as changing the difficulty, each level unlocks more of the game than the level that is easier than it. The enemies are tougher to defeat in the higher levels, but there are more rewards.

The player must guide the assassin through the levels facing enemies ranging from vicious dogs to wall mounted laser cannons. As well as the platforms, the player is able to control the assassin to climb on walls and ceilings as a method of getting around, and avoiding enemies. The player can use the boomerang to attack enemies, or use bonus weapons that are gained by achieving certain requirements. The whole game is controlled by a joystick.

Assassin: Special Edition was released 2 years after the original game and various gameplay elements were altered. The first level is gone which means that there no longer are the dogs as enemies, also the boomerang has been replaced with a laser gun.

		<desc>Autoduel is a hybrid game based on Steve Jackson Games board game Car Wars. It incorporates elements of role-playing, driving and action-based combat. The game is set in a futuristic version of USA, where gangs and vigilantes rule the wilderness, and people's only protection are armored cars with mounted weaponry. The player is cast in the role of an average person who must at first earn enough money to buy an own car, and then perform courier missions throughout the country.

The game's progression is fairly open-ended: the player is free to visit different cities, explore highways, participate in car Arena battles to earn money, take on gangsters in the wilderness, salvage car parts, etc. A few courier missions must be completed in order to advance the story. The player can construct and customize vehicles using guns, mine-layers, smokescreens, oil slicks, rockets and other accessories, choosing between various body and chassis types for the car. The entire game is viewed from a top-down perspective.</desc>

		<desc>In the sequel to Barbarian / Death Sword, the Wizard Drax is back after your previous defeat of him. But this time, you're not alone. The princess you saved back then has taken up a sword and joined your cause! Now, it's more than a death match. You have to explore the many tunnels in his dungeon, defeat the dangerous monsters that come between you and put cold steel to Drax's throat. 

The game has similar game play to the original, but with a different challenge. Various monsters will come and attack you, but you'll need to use different approaches in order to defeat each of them. For example, you can't overhead chop a monster that's shorter than your axe. There are 4 dungeon levels to explore before you reach Drax at the final stage.</desc>

		<desc>Game-play consists of arcade style fast and frantic reflex action from the first-person perspective, much akin to Atari's coin-op Battlezone and programmer Paul Woaks' earlier and very similar 8-bit game Encounter. The game takes place on a seemingly endless flat landscape, littered with obstacles in the form of some pseudo 3D spikes protruding from the ground. Armadas of hostile UFOs shoot fire balls at you from every direction. Your aiming reticle is in the centre of the display, and is surrounded by circular radar, which is formed by a series of small white dots, within this are numerous red dots which represent the UFO enemies. You are dealt an initial five lives, and you score points for each UFO destroyed. The game features environmental effects, such as day time turning to night, and vice versa.</desc>

		<desc>The plot of "Bad Company" is quickly told: Earth is dying and mankind needs new worlds to colonize, the Nu-Worlds. You and your (optional) companion have the task to clear those worlds from hostile alien insectoids.

"Bad Company" is played in a pseudo-3D view (third person) that very much resembles that of Space Harrier games.
Before you start to play you'll have to choose one of the eight offered troopers as your player character. This decision will influence gameplay later on, e.g. you won't be able to carry a specific weapon or your character is especially fast, and so on. When it comes to the action you'll be confronted with several different alien types including "level bosses".You battle these foes by using one of the four available weapon systems (equipment can be changed in the course of the game). You have full movement control over your character, meaning the screen isn't auto-scrolling like in comparable games. You can also take cover behind certain obstacles or choose to blow them up.</desc>

***Badlands*** is a 1989 arcade game published by Atari Games. It was 
later ported by Domark under the Tengen label to a number of home 
computers. It is set in the aftermath of a nuclear war and races around 
abandoned wastelands with many hazards. Three gun-armed cars race around 
to win prizes.
















***Gameplay***
















Badlands is effectively the spiritual successor to Atari's previous 
racing games Super Sprint and Championship Sprint. Similarly to the 
Sprint titles, Badlands pits three cars against each other in a three 
lap race around a small, single-screen circuit. Bonuses are present in 
the form of wrenches which can be traded for goods such as extra speed,
 extra acceleration or better tires
















Unlike the Sprint games, Badlands expands upon the formula, taking place 
in a post-apocalyptic environment and equipping each of the players with 
cannons. In reality, the cannons do little except to slow cars down by 
repeatedly shooting at them, but the shop between levels offers the 
possibility of arming the car with missiles which will destroy the 
target car, placing it at a severe disadvantage as a replacement is 
brought onto the track, taking a few seconds.
















The tracks also featured a number of new obstacles, including mines 
and retractable barricades.
















**Home Versions***
















The home computer versions of the game were released by Domark under 
the Tengen label. Development was carried out by Teque under the 
leadership of Matt Furniss. All of the versions were accurate in 
gameplay terms, with graphical compromises being necessary depending 
on the system. The Amiga and Atari ST versions of the game were the 
most faithful to the original, although the C64 version was graphically
 very similar, in spite of more blocky graphics.
















The Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions were virtually identical to each 
other.
















Response to the Spectrum version was mixed. Your Sinclair and CRASH 
awarded average marks, both claiming in reviews of the original and 
re-release that the title's contemporary Super Off-Road was superior. 
Sinclair User expressed more enthusiasm for the game, but made the 
same comparison to Super Off-Road.

		<desc>The objective is the same as in the original Balance of Power: use your military, covert, and industrial forces to make your country the most prestigious in the world while avoiding nuclear war. However, it is now 1989, and the Communist Block is crumbling...

Chris Crawford, who rarely ever made a sequel to a computer game, was besieged by mails asking him to update his classic from a few years before to reflect the new state of the world. Russia was falling, the Iron Curtain was shattering, and smaller countries were beginning to assert their own regional power with more freedom from the bipolar world of the Cold War.

The result was the 1990 Edition. This game featured an updated database, but the most significant new features were:

1. The multipolar level, where small countries could go to war with their neighbors on their own. Of course, you could help them out (or encourage them!) by sending in military aid.

2. 18 more countries, bringing the total to 80.

3. A "Crisis Advisory Board" of four people, who would give you advice during international crises. The nice thing about being a Superpower is that the little countries do whatever you tell them, but you still have to watch out for your main rivals (USSR or the US).</desc>

		<desc>In the 12th century, the Emperor Hui Zhong is faced with an internal rebellion led by Imperial Minister Gao Qiu. The Song Dynasty comes to an end, and Gao Qiu became the new ruler. You take the role of an exiled ruler, and you must build your stats up to be able to challenge- and destroy- Gao Qiu and restore Hui Zhong to the throne.

The game is a military strategy game, like most of Koei's games, but instead of conquering a country, the goal is to depose the despotic ruler of China. You start out lowly, and have to work your way up by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles. You have to earn the right to attack Gao Qiu's home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.</desc>

		<desc>Not to be confused with Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax by Palace Software, Barbarian II is a direct sequel to the Psygnosis game Barbarian, an action, point and click hybrid released four years earlier. The game continues the tale of Hegor the Barbarian. After being improperly defeated some years ago, evil lord Necron has been reincarnated by one of his cult followers. Now only Hegor is strong, courageous, and stupid enough to face Necron and his minions.

Unlike the original Barbarian, which was an action game with a point-and-click control interface, Barbarian II plays just like a typical action title with a maze-like layout. During his adventures, Hegor will visit many locales like a forest full of thugs, werewolves and spiky pits, a long, long cave, a semi-friendly human city, a dungeon, and finally Necron’s temple. All areas are rather large and are full of enemies and traps.</desc>

***Batman*** is an action video game developed by Ocean Software based on the 
1989 film of the same name. It was released in 1989 for the Amiga, 
Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, ZX Spectrum.
The game is also know as ***Batman: The Movie***.
















***Gameplay***
















The game consists of five stages based on events from the movie. Each 
stage has a time limit and a health gauge (represented by Batman's 
face turning into the Joker's), with Batman losing a life if he runs 
out of either. The first stage sees players controlling Batman as he 
navigates the Axis Chemical Plant to confront Jack Napier, leading 
to the incident in which he becomes The Joker. In this level, the 
game features side-scrolling gameplay, in which Batman can use his 
Batarangs to defeat enemies or and his grapple gun to reach higher 
platforms and swing across gaps. In the second level, Batman rides 
in his Batmobile where he must dodge traffic and use a grapple to 
swing around corners to avoid running into the police. The third 
level is a puzzle section in which Batman must identify various 
components for Smilex, the deadly chemical Joker has put into the 
market. The fourth level takes place during Joker's parade, in which 
Batman must use the Batwing to cut away balloons filled with poisonous 
gas without hitting the balloons themselves. Finally, the fifth level, 
which reprises the gameplay of the first level, sees Batman make his 
way to the top of Gotham Cathedral to finally confront Joker.




***Reception***




The game was number 1 in the Spectrum charts for February 1990 and was awarded Game of the Year in Crash magazine. 
Computer Gaming World recommended the Amiga version to action fans, but reported that the Commodore 64 version was too buggy.

		<desc>Battle Bound is a side scrolling beat 'em up where the player takes control of Calumn the Mighty who after saving Lady Charlotte has to go and conquer the lair of a horrific golem. But to get there he has to move through the graveyard of the beast which is inhabited by barbarous nomads and cross the bridge of fire which is guarded by dragon men. Calumn is equipped with an axe that he can throw at enemies or he can choose to punch them in a melee fight. For smaller enemies such as the crawling slugs a kick is needed. By destroying slugs it's possible to obtain different tokens. Red ones re-energizes, blue ones gives a power up, green ones give invulnerability and yellow ones give extra lives. In addition to all the enemies Calumn also has to avoid drowning in quicksand.</desc>

		<desc>This side-view shoot 'em up involves trying to retrieve two nuclear weapons which have been stolen by terrorists. These are located at opposite ends of the playing area, so you can pursue them in either order. Needless to say, the terrorists have plenty of forces out to prevent you getting too far.

Unusually, the game features both a helicopter and a tank - you choose either from the base, and can fly/drive back there to change. The best strategy is to use the helicopter to shoot out air-based enemies and repair the various bridges, then return for the tank. You get 4000 seconds in which to complete all this, and losing a life costs you 500 of these.</desc>

		<desc>As Ben E. Factor himself, you must travel through the six moons of Minniat, on which the peaceful and good-natured people of Lullyat have been kidnapped. These Merry Men each have their own potential skill once rescued, so releasing them in the right order is often essential for completing a level. Some Merry Men have grey suits - this marks them out as joyless and awkward characters which must be guided through a coloring machine.

The Miniation people have loaded the 60 levels with various nasties, ranging from slugs (slow, but must be jumped), Rock Men (those with sharp backs are more dangerous, but both are quite nippy), spiked teeth emerging from manholes, and so on. A large map is provided, and at any point you can pause the game and scroll around the map, which makes the forward planning easier.</desc>

		<desc>Shortly after the war, several countries want to control Berlin. An atomic bomb has been smuggled into the city by the Americans. You play an American spy, whose mission is to guard this bomb and not to let Stalin have it under any circumstances.

This is one of the early examples of a 3rd person perspective point & click adventure, the interface being slightly more complicated than the famous SCUMM system.</desc>

		<desc>Eddie Murphy became a star in the police film Beverly Hills Cop, and it was this license that Tynesoft used to create a game featuring four distinct sub-games, each of which can be practiced from the main screen in some versions. First Axel Foley visits a warehouse to shoot out some bad guys in a Green Beret-influenced sequence.

The second level (first on the C64 version) involves driving after 3 lorries full of weapons, and shooting them out one by one, Chase HQ-style. Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way.

The final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement angles and only one enemy on screen at a time.</desc>

		<desc>>Long ago, when the world was a dark and evil place, out of a black and 
>troubled sky emerged three fearsome dragons - creatures from hell, 
>bearers of destruction, flame, fire and torment. The world was plunged 
>into an age of devastation and misery. Only one man had the courage,

***Black Tiger***, known in Japan as Black Dragon, is a 1987 platform 
game released for the arcades by Capcom.
















A barbarian hero jumps and fights his way through a variety of 
colourful, enemy-packed levels. The sprawling, eight-way scrolling, 
two-dimensional levels are packed with hidden bonuses to encourage 
and reward exploration. Though a percentage of these bonuses consist 
of dubious and often self-evident "advice", most come in the form of 
"Zenny coins", currency that allows the player to buy such items as an 
upgrade to their weapons and armour, keys for treasure chests, and 
anti-poisoning potions. Special items that reveal coins, upgraded 
armour, full vitality, extra lives, extra time, or simply bonus 
points may be found by attacking certain walls. The player's vitality 
bar will also increase up to three times as a reward for reaching 
score benchmarks.
















The Japanese version has a few changes that makes it more challenging 
than its American counterpart. Several of the "falling rock" obstacles 
were added in this version. Additionally, the prices of many of the 
items are higher and more points are needed to increase maximum 
vitality. But perhaps the biggest difference is related to fighting 
the later bosses (the three dragons and the dual sword-wielding foes 
at the end of stages 5 and 7). In the American version, it is possible 
to duck and avoid taking damage when the bosses touch the player's 
character as long as one of their projectiles does not hit him. 
In the Japanese version, the player is not able to do this.
















Europe-based U.S. Gold released versions of Black Tiger for 
Amstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and ZX Spectrum in 1989. 
















A version for the Commodore 64 was released in 1990, developed 
by Softworx.

		<desc>The world has been enslaved by Murk, and you've got to free it by collecting the seven fragments of a tablet which are in the possession of seven wizards who inhabit seven towers.

Blade Warrior is a unique game in two ways, the most obvious being the graphics. Everything in this game is seen in silhouette - as you wander around looking for magical items and killing baddies, all you see is your silhouette and the silhouette of everything around you. The background is made up of a night sky, with clouds and hills.

Secondly, the game is an unusual mix of adventuring and battling. On your way to collecting magical items and exploring the huge ingame map, you're assaulted by baddies. Then, once you have collected certain artifacts, you can conjure up spells (so long as you have the recipe) back in your tower, trade with wizards for those all important tablet pieces and get clues to the next important artifacts.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the arcade game, Blades Of Steel is a hockey arcade action game (gameplay doesn't require the need to worry about statistics or provide the ability to customize teams.) Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer. In one player mode there are single game and tournament mode options. From time to time a fight may break out, which will provide a close up view of the two players. The player has control during the miniature fight game sequence, with the loser having to spend time in the penalty box. The referee will break up fights that go on too long, and calls a few penalties such as icing. Several short clips of digitized voices are also featured.</desc>

		<desc>The main character in this old fashioned no frills shoot 'em up is a Rambo doppelganger, which the developers may have been lucky not to be sued over. The main player is surrounded by a large tank which moves around as if you are walking it Flintstones style.

Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of.</desc>

home computer platforms. Its box featured artwork by Chris Achilleos.
















The plotline identifies the player as a champion of Trazere who, after 
recruiting up to three fellow champions, travels through dungeons and 
mazes fighting creatures along the way to find and destroy the evil 
Zendick, and banish the Lord of Entropy.
















***Gameplay***
















All of the champions fall into the four classes of Warrior, Mage, 
Adventurer or Thief, each with their own particular capability. Within 
each class there are four characters available, each with their own 
colour of Red, Blue, Green or Yellow. Each colour also has its own 
particular advantage, largely with respect to the families of spells 
the character will be most adept at casting and developing. However, 
that colour is also important when it comes to matching up coloured 
rings later in the game to magnify the effects of spell-casting.
















One particularly memorable quirk of the game is the ability granted to 
players to hold simple conversations with traders, other champions, 
and even enemies during combat. Stock pseudo-medieval phrases such as 
"Truly my courage is remarkable" and "Begone, thou oaf" are selected 
using a menu, and can be used in combination to flatter a desired 
companion, aggravate an enemy, or lower the price of an item which 
the player wishes to purchase. Many gameplayers have found that the 
price of a long sword (RRP 10 gold pieces) can fall to as little as 
6 or 7 after the shopkeeper has been buttered-up with phrases such 
as "Thou seems fine" - particularly when this strategy is used in 
conjunction with the Beguile spell (most effectively cast by Megrim).
















Bloodwych is also remarkable for the sheer scale of its maps. Gameplay 
can easily last weeks until the player eventually navigates his way 
though mazes and past monsters to the start of the enormous and 
fiendish "towers", in which the gameplay becomes focused on the task 
of collecting crystals, with a view to destroying Zendick and his 
associates.
















Bloodwych was inspired by Dungeon Master from 1987, like many other 
similar games (or even clones) in this era, for instance the Eye of 
the Beholder series.

		<desc>Blue Angels: Formation Flight Squadron is an F/A-18 flight simulator, with a focus on Air Shows. The Blue Angels are the United States' Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, known for tight maneuvers and precision flying. The game attempts to replicate this by offering formation flying, having to react and coordinate with other Blue Angels in the air.

The player can practice any maneuver in the simulator: dozens of high, low and flat maneuvers, Diamond 360 passes, left rolls and 4-point rolls or an entire air show for example. Other than practice events, the player can perform an air show or just go for a free flight. In the air, players fly from a 1st person perspective inside the plane or a 3rd person perspective from a chase plane behind the player. Additionally there are 4 different camera views and 3 different gameplay speeds. After the flight, an analysis is displayed of the flight and the player's performance graded.</desc>

		<desc>Blue Max is a World War I fighter plane simulator, where the player may fly fighter planes such as Fokker, Sopwith, Spad, and many other ones.

The game allows split screen gaming for two players, cooperatively or competitively, with multiple 3D camera angle features. Missions involve shooting down enemy planes, while others focus on specific targets. The game includes a very unique feature for those who chose to use it: the ability to convert the dogfights to turn-based battles fought on a hexagonal map but still maintaining the 3D view in a frozen window.</desc>

		<desc>Booly is a puzzle game with a similar concept to Gem’X in some ways. You are presented with a top-down view of an array of inter-connected blocks, which are shown in a variety of colours. The aim is to turn them all to grey, but clicking on them (using the pointer you are in control of) will often cause a pattern of other squares to change to the next colour in the sequence as well. You are doing all this with a time limit for each of the 300 levels. A level designer allows you to create your own sequence of up to 1000 levels.</desc>

		<desc>Botics is a Pong variant set in the future. It is disguised as futuristic sports event in which the player fights against five opponents. The basic idea is that each playfield has a large opening on two sides which are guarded by remote-controlled robots. Each of the opponents controls a robot with the goal to reflect a bouncing ball so it enters the opposite opening. If that happens, the screen switches to the next of five areas, e.g. if the players were in the second chamber, they either switch to area one or three depending on who scored. A player needs to score a certain amount of times to win a match.

Variations to the areas (which are the same for each opponent) consist of obstacles covering the middle of the room. There is also the possibility to charge up the robot which results in a more powerful and fast returning of the ball, but when overdone it causes the robot to explode.</desc>

New features include titanium (indestructible) walls, growing walls, and slime that allows boulders and diamonds to drop through it at a varying rate.</desc>

Brataccas is a place where greed and corruption rule the day. The residents are treacherous, and while they can be bribed they are not above murder, so the player has to be careful.</desc>

		<desc>An early squad-level tactical combat game, much like the X-Com series of games and the more contemporary Laser Squad. Breach 2 features turn-based combat from an isometric point of view set in the far future. As one of the more unique aspects the squad leaders gain experience from successful missions should they survive.

Breach 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe as Omnitrend's Universe and Rules of Engagement series and shares the same backstory with those games. Breach 2 is a part of the IGS (Interlocking Game System) and compatible with the two Rules of Engagement games. This means you can use Breach 2 to resolve the tactical combat situations, boarding an enemy ship for example, you run into in the starship command simulation, which is the heart and soul of the Rules of Engagement series.</desc>

		<desc>Breach is a turn-based tactical squad combat game. It introduces team-oriented missions, RPG-style squad leader development and a scenario builder.

In the ten missions supplied with the retail version (and potentially infinitely more created with the included scenario builder), a squad of usually five space marines under the command of a squad leader embarks on sci-fi missions that involve hostage rescue, data retrieval or simply elimination of opponents. Squad members advance and act in turn on basis of a movement point system. 

The multi-level maps consist of outside terrain and structures with several stories, connected by lifts, filled with enemies and objects. Squad members can find and use weapons such as grenades, rockets or detonation packs and tools such as Medikits, scanners or shields.

In an unique twist, the squad leader advances from mission to mission (while the rest of the team is always new), improving his basic stats with each successfully completed assignment, based on his performance. Only experienced leaders may attempt STAR-rated scenarios. If the squad leader gets killed, he is lost forever: the game deletes the corresponding leader file.</desc>

		<desc>Brides of Dracula is a two-player split-screen game similar to Spy vs. Spy in gameplay. Each player (human or CPU) controls either the vampire hunter Van Helsing or Count Dracula. Van Helsing is summoned to the Bistritz village to kill Dracula and his brides. His goal is to find thirteen tools to kill Dracula, bring them back to Helsing's home and store them in the cupboard. For Dracula, the objective is to create thirteen brides by finding women, biting and leading them back to the crypt, where thirteen coffins are lined up waiting for their recipients.

Both characters can be killed by certain hazardous environments and non-player characters (NPCs). Some of these dangers may effect only one of the characters (ghouls only attack Van Helsing, while priests and villagers only harm Dracula). Each player starts with three lives. Collected objects and women are displayed at the bottom of the character window, along with the health bar. The game takes place in the church cemetery and the adjacent village.</desc>

		<desc>A computer’s mazelike circuitry is infected with bugs, and you have been sent in to destroy them. You are armed with bombs, mines, blockades, and various types of hatchlings, which when released will track the bugs and hopefully stop them.

The basic gameplay is inspired by Dynablaster, but it differs because there is more than one way to kill the foes off. Depending on which way you push the joystick as you press fire, you will either release a quick-exploding bomb, a proximity mine, or a hatchling. Collecting ‘EN’ symbols will restore your energy, and ‘IQ’ symbols increase the ability of your hatchlings to track and hit your foes. Be careful when placing blocks; it is possible to shut yourself in.

The single-player game gives you three lives, plus another when you complete each of the 50 levels. The multi-player game can be played in 2 different ways – co-operative (work together to clear the computer of bugs) or competitive (Dynablaster-style free-for-all destruction).</desc>

		<desc>Despite the smutty title, the only ‘big people’ requirement is a driving license, as you’re racing through Europe and America in a variety of cars. Each level has a visual background reflecting part of the country.

The route is mapped out beforehand, but it needn’t be strictly adhered to, as the surrounding roads are all presented and can be used as you wish. The computer cars in the race will often deviate from the course as well, adding real navigation to the proceedings. You accrue damage from contact, which needs to be repaired after the race, so you need to keep some prize money coming in. 

The racing is illegal, so you are pursued by police as you go, similarly to Crazy Cars 3, so make sure not to get caught, and do your dangerous driving out of their sight. You’ll have to drive on the correct side of the road and negotiate pedestrians and other traffic as well</desc>

		<desc>Intelligence reports suggest that POWs have been captured and are being held hostage at the guerilla outpost on Butcher Hill. The game is divided into three sections.

In the first section, players steer their dinghy along a river while avoiding mines and other obstacles. If the dinghy comes into contact with any mine, it explodes. However, when the player has collected ammo, the mines can be destroyed. Coming into contact with rocks causes the dinghy to bounce out of the water for a short distance. When a jetty appears, pressing the fire button allows the player to land and start the next section.

The second section has the player finding their way through dense jungle whose path lead to the enemy camp at the base of Butcher Hill. Stopping you from proceeding are soldiers that have orders to shoot you on sight. Mines are also scattered around the jungle floor and must be avoided. If players were able to obtain a compass in the first section, their current direction will be displayed at the right of the control panel. Shooting all the soldiers in the jungle gives the player extra ammunition and stamina.

In the final section, players need to destroy the enemy camp by blowing up huts with bullets or grenades. While they are doing that, they must also be on the lookout for any soldiers that tries to leave the camp to bring back more soldiers.</desc>

		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Cabal is a shooter where the protagonist runs back and forth along the bottom of the screen, ducking and dodging bullets and grenades from the enemy. The roll maneuver from the arcade was not implemented in the PC version. The player returns fire by moving a target around the screen which also moves the player character and may expose him to enemy fire. 

The enemies throughout the five levels come thick and fast and there are many of them. They include normal foot soldiers, tanks, helicopters and end of level bosses such as submarines and war machines. Just about everything on the screen can be blown up or shot. There are bonus points to be picked up for destroying buildings and weapons to be picked up from the enemy, such as machine guns and shotguns. A two-player mode is also available.</desc>

		<desc>The first in the strategy series set in the Roman Empire’s peak era starts off with you as ruler of a small province, although if you’re successful you will get tougher assignments.

You must build the city, placing crucial features such as housing estates, roads, policing, water supply, social events and the like. You’re not restricted to one city – you can build another area, linked by roads, once you’ve got the first one running smoothly. You have slaves at your disposal to build and maintain everything.

All this would be easy if you had an infinite supply of money, the civilians didn’t complain about anything, there was no threat of combat, and you didn’t have to keep the people above you happy. Needless to say, all of these problems crop up.

Via the forums, you will get public opinions, which are affected by how high taxes are, and whether people feel they’re getting value for money. If they don’t they could riot;– what will you tell the Emperor if that happens?

Barbarian threats are commonplace, so you need to maintain an army, and at times send it into battle. If you own Cohort II, you can fight the battles using that, but otherwise you just issue the orders then learn of the result.</desc>

***California Games*** is a 1987 Epyx sports video game for many home 
computers and video game consoles. Branching from their popular Summer 
Games and Winter Games series, this game consisted of some sports 
purportedly popular in California including skateboarding, freestyle 
footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX.
















The game sold very well, topping game selling charts for winter months. 
It also got very positive reaction from reviewers, many of whom consider 
California Games to be the last classic Epyx sports game, due to staff 
changes not long after its release.
















The game was followed in 1991 by California Games 2, but the sequel 
failed to match the original's success.
















Originally released for the Apple II and Commodore 64, this game was 
very lucrative for Epyx and was released for several other platforms 
over the years. It was eventually ported to Amiga, Apple IIGS, 
Atari 2600, Atari ST, Atari Lynx, DOS, Sega Mega Drive, Amstrad CPC, 
ZX Spectrum, Nintendo Entertainment System, MSX and Sega Master System.

The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once). 

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<desc>Defending the ancient Carthagean Empire from Roman invasion is your challenge in this arcade-strategy fusion.

Your armies can be supported by catapult and elephant-mounted units, but only if these are already available and you find them first (building doesn't really come into play). Guarding the hills also gives you an advantage in combat.

Each unit becomes more skilled and happy if they win battles, but fatigue comes into play if they fight too frequently. You need to pay for the soldiers, which is done by producing goods to trade.

Actually distributing the cash appropriately involves transporting it via Chariots, which improbably leads to an arcade racing-type sequence in which you must avoid not only rocks and trees, but also Roman chariots (why they are heading in the same direction as you every single time needs explanation) - contact loses you money.</desc>

		<desc>Eskel and Sogrom are the greatest magicians in the land, and both are hungry for power. The long war between them is beginning to enter Endgame, in the Rochebrume cluster of 23 islands, each with their own special range of magic on offer.

The game is highly strategic, with icon-based controls and a turn-based structure similar to Battle Isle. You will need to destroy the rival wizard's forces on each island. It's important to hold as many castles as possible, so as to generate the maximum amount of magic. Magic is used to move and create your forces, and to weaken your opposition.</desc>

		<desc>"Wow, what a weird plot and if that wasn’t surreal enough the wonderfully detailed graphics add even more to the superb atmosphere as do the creaking sound effects and simulated speech (and no, it isn’t Welsh!). Some of the characters encountered are truly bizarre – ever tried making love to a spider woman? The puzzles themselves are very cryptic indeed but there is much more to the game with underground caverns to explore and your girlfriend to rescue while you avoid being chopped up on the sacrificial altar! The icon system is extremely easy to use and an extra tactical element is introduced in using the useful psi powers. A brilliantly implemented science-fiction adventure with wide-ranging appeal." - Zzap! (Sep, 1989)</desc>

		<desc>The Chaos Engine is a top-down run and gun video game developed by The Bitmap Brothers and published by Renegade Software in 1993. The game is set in a steampunk Victorian age in which one or two players must battle the hostile creations of the titular Chaos Engine across four landscapes and ultimately defeat the Chaos Engine and its deranged inventor.

It was first released for the Commodore Amiga, a version available for AGA Amigas, and later ported to MS-DOS, and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Atari ST, Amiga CD32, Amiga 500, RISC OS and Sega Mega Drive platforms. In the SNES and Sega versions, the character The Preacher had his clerical collar removed and was renamed The Scientist. The U.S. versions of these two ports were retitled Soldiers of Fortune. A sequel to the game, The Chaos Engine 2, was released in 1996.

The setting is a steampunk Victorian era England. The backstory of the game has some similarities to William Gibson and Bruce Sterling's novel, The Difference Engine, also set in an alternate history Victorian age.

A time traveller on a reconnaissance mission from the distant future became stranded in England of the late 1800s, and his technology came into the hands of the Royal Society led by Baron Fortesque (based upon Charles Babbage), a grand inventor. Fortesque then retro engineered many of the futuristic contraptions, creating an entirely different, alternate timeline.

Baron Fortesque then succeeded in his greatest creation yet - the Chaos Engine - which was able to experiment with matter, and the very nature of space and time. Unfortunately for the rest of the proud kingdom, the Engine then proceeded to become sentient and captured and assimilated its creator, then began to change the countryside for the worse. Vile monsters and destructive automata appeared everywhere, and even prehistoric beasts were resurrected. Telegram wires connecting the British Isles to the European mainland are cut, and any ship attempting to enter a British port is attacked. The British Royal Family, along with members of Parliament and a large number of refugees manage to escape across the sea, bringing with them many tales of horror. The British Empire is left in tatters, and the world in economic and political chaos. This lures a number of mercenaries on a potentially rewarding quest to infiltrate the quarantined Britain, find the root of the problem and swiftly bring a full stop to it.

The introductory sequence is displayed in text on the screen on the floppy disk based Amiga versions, but a slightly modified version is narrated with a voiceover on the Amiga CD32 version, together with some scene-setting animations.

***Chip's Challenge*** is a top-down tile-based puzzle video game 
created in 1989 by Chuck Sommerville originally for the hand-held 
Atari Lynx. Chip's Challenge was then later ported to multiple formats 
including the Amiga, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, DOS, and Windows, 
included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack and Best of Microsoft 
Entertainment Pack (the last of which was written by Tony Krueger in 1991)
. Microsoft licensed Chip's Challenge from Epyx to write a DOS and 
Windows version of the game; while porting the game, the logic was 
slightly changed from the original version. It has also been converted 
to the TI-84+ calculator and the TI-89 Titanium.




The original game was designed and coded by Chuck Sommerville, who also 
made about a third of the levels.[3] Most of the conversions from the 
Atari Lynx original to other formats were carried out by Images 
Software in the UK.




The premise of the game is that high-school nerd Chip McCallahan has 
met Melinda The Mental Marvel in the school science laboratory and must 
navigate through Melinda's "Clubhouse" (a series of increasingly 
difficult puzzles) in order to prove himself and gain membership to 
the very exclusive Bit Buster Club.




***Gameplay***




Chip's Challenge consists of a series of 148 two-dimensional levels 
(149 in Microsoft's version) which feature the player character, 
Nerdy Chip McCallahan, often called just Chip, and various game 
elements such as computer chips, buttons, locked doors, water and 
lethal monsters. Gameplay involves using arrow keys, directional pad 
or mouse to move Chip about each of the levels in turn, collecting 
enough chips to open the chip socket at the end of each level, get to 
the exit, and move on to the next level.




While the same set of rules applies to each level, there are many 
different kinds of levels. Some are action-oriented and some are 
puzzle-oriented. Most levels have a time limit. Types of levels 
include solving a block-pushing puzzle to clear a path, dodging 
enemies, and moving through a maze. Levels can be skipped by entering 
an appropriate four-letter non-case-sensitive password. For the PC 
versions, game progress is automatically saved. If one is having a 
lot of trouble with a level, the game allows the player to skip to 
the next level. Progress is measured in terms of completed levels 
and player score, which is a sum of the scores obtained on each level. 
Level scores for timed levels can be improved by quickly completing 
the level, and scores on all levels can be improved by using fewer 
attempts to complete the level.

		<desc>The Chronicles of Omega is a side-scrolling platformer in which demons took control over the village Omega. The player takes control over one of the twins Alwin and Irma in their quest to drive those evil beasts out. Most of the time is spent with jumping, dodging enemies or killing them with the magic wand which shoots fire balls. The player character has a bar of life energy which decreases when hit by an enemy and when it runs out, a life is lost. Killed enemies leave money behind which can be used to purchase power-ups in shops.</desc>

***Cisco Heat*** is a 1990 arcade racing game developed and published by 
Jaleco.
















***Gameplay***
















The player takes on the role of an officer who must race his squad car 
through San Francisco in an attempt to win the first ever 
'National Championship Police Car Steeplechase'. The gameplay is similar 
to that of other contemporary racing games, with a two-speed shifter 
and a chase view. It includes sights such as the famous trams and the 
Golden Gate Bridge. The player can pick from two cars, a Ford LTD Crown 
Victoria-lookalike police car and a Nissan 300ZX turbo-lookalike police 
car.
















***Ports***
















In late 1991, versions for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, 
ZX Spectrum and PC were developed by ICE Software and released by Image 
Works, shortly before the Robert Maxwell-owned company folded. Stuart 
Campbell suggested that the Amiga version he played had little in 
common with the arcade game, but was a good game in its own right.

		<desc>Essentially an update of 8-bit game Theatre Europe, your task is again to play World War 3 scenarios fighting as NATO vs the Warsaw Pact.

The game uses pretty basic handling. While you can access some menus as the bottom of the screen you can see the map on the main part of the screen where each unit is indicated as small square. Your aim, of course, is to eliminate all the enemy units.

Some special actions can be selected, like deploying special units, attack with chemical weapons or even nuclear ones.</desc>

		<desc>Conflict: Middle East is a detailed wargame/simulation of the Arab/Israeli Wars from 1973 until the present (1991). The action is historical and hypothetical. You can fight the entire 1973 Arab/Israeli conflict on an operational level as the Israelis or take on the more daunting task of the Arab forces. Choose the hypothetical 1990's scenario for modern day desert warfare. The game is fought at the Brigade/Division level where you will control every detail of land and air war down to the individual infantry squads, vehicles and gun tubes. You must also keep track of weather, supplies, and politics as they will impact many of your options.</desc>

		<desc>Cosmic Bouncer is an action game similar to Bounder in which the player takes the role of a tennis ball which was made alive by a space beam caused by a computer mishap. Not only that, but it also finds itself at some distant place in the universe.

Now it has to travel through 22 automatically scrolling levels to find the way home. Movement consists of bouncing, and there are many obstacles like holes, disappearing floors or death tiles to avoid. Most platforms disappear after a touch and the player can use a limited function which creates a platform under the tennis ball. Failing a level, e.g. by falling in a hole, causes a life loss in the 11 main levels. After every level there is a shorter bonus level. It is still possible to fail the level, but instead of losing a life the player just gets teleported to the beginning.</desc>

		<desc>In Cosmic Pirate the player takes the role of a criminal who works for The Council, a space pirate organization. It offers several missions to the player, all with the goal to hijack a space truck. During the course of the game the player will undertake increasingly more dangerous and difficult missions.

This game is a multi-directional shooter. For each mission the player gets transported to the estimated destination of the truck. However, the correct space sector has to be found first through the means of elimination. The player uses warp beacons to go to the next sector and when the correct one is found, the radar shows the way to the truck. 

However, every usage of a beacon costs money which is earned by shooting alien ships in the current sector, which can be freely explored in all directions. Every killed enemy gives credits and probably leaves an extra behind which gives advantages if picked up, e.g. bonus credits, a protection shield or a smart bomb. Money left after finishing a mission can be reinvested into ship upgrades.</desc>

		<desc>This multi-level action/adventure takes players back 40 years to find Professor K.K. Renegade, who predicts that a catastrophic asteroid is heading straight for earth. You're in charge of finding Professor Renegade.

Select one of the five most intrepid Adventurers from England, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. to spearhead the search. Professor Renegade was last seen in the unexplored region of the highest Tibetan ranges; an area populated by creatures and conditions of the professor's own design: venomous stone snakes, reptilian birds, and acid storms. Not only must your Adventurer survive these tests of courage, but he must and properly use such curious objects as spurs, a vacuum cleaner, and a unicycle. Once you locate the professor and convince him to help, you'll need to help him construct an anti-asteroid deflector to prevent the destruction of earth. You must now search for high-tech tools such as an atomic pile, a 9-volt battery, and a bent coat hanger!

Use the joystick and the appropriate keys to maneuver the Adventurer across the landscape. You have 30 days to complete the mission. During the mission, the Adventurer collects various items (points are awarded for each). Some items serve little purpose; others are vital; and others only work in certain places. Only one item can be held at a time and it must be held to be used. Native bearers carry the items collected.

To look at what each bearer has, type 1 or 2 to scroll through the bearers. The Adventurer can exchange the item held (press S) with a bearer that is closest to him. Its trial and error time. Good luck. The game comes with cheats and a map for those that require a little help.</desc>

		<desc>Linus had crash landed on a distant planet called Earth, and made his way back home again. Trouble is, no one believes his tale of the planet he discovered! Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac Mansion). To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once you've cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish you can receive a password allowing you to continue the game later from the same point.</desc>

		<desc>At the beginning of the 21st century, a mad scientist by the name of Mr. K has created an army of artificial soldiers. He conquered the industrial city of Atlantis, and is now preparing to take over the world. The United Nations decided to retaliate by sending two of their top class Special Forces officers, Ben and Andy, infiltrate the city and destroy the enemy base using a newly developed time bomb--Sigma.

Crack Down is a time-limited action game. The two heroes, Ben and Andy, have to get through the levels as quickly as possible placing bombs on X marks scattered around the levels. Although the levels are heavily defended, the player has an array of weaponry including a cannon, machine gun, and superbombs.

The game may be played as either a one or two-player game.</desc>

		<desc>Distress calls received from deep space report hostile alien life forms, and you are the only space security captain within range. Responding to the distress call, you hurry to save a spaceship, a space station which has had its reactor put on self-destruct to prevent the station from falling into the enemies hands, and the lunar base that have become infested with Creatures.

The spaceship, although seemingly abandoned by the Creature, has inside, guard dogs and beastoids that fire weapons. They were left behind by their master. You must survive their attack to find life-sustaining supplies and the key to disarm the reactor. Upon receiving these, you must safely return to your ship to start your journey to the terror-filled space station. The space station has much greater danger. You must gather more essential supplies, but more importantly, you must disarm the reactor before it self-destructs. You have the key, but where is the reactor? Once this step of your mission has been done, you must make your way back out while trying to get past the alien attack droids, acid leaks, and more vicious beastoids.</desc>

		<desc>Crime City is a classical point-and-click adventure. You play Mr. White, a poor chap who writes detective stories but wants nothing more than to be a real private investigator. It's a pretty classical story: one day, he can't really write a thing, but then, a mysterious blonde stands before his door, telling him his Father, Henry White, was arrested for murder. It's up to you to prove the police wrong.

A difference to the classical adventure exists: you need money to travel, get information or training. To get money, you can trade at the stock market. What's also different is that the time of the day really matters and that the protagonist becomes sleepy after staying up too long.</desc>

		<desc>The Legend of William Tell is based on the TV series Crossbow which in turn is based on the Swiss national hero William Tell. The player takes the role of Tell who tries to end the reign of the evil duke Gessler.

This is an action game with puzzle elements in which Tell explores the environment, talks to people and collects everything he finds. The objects are either used to solve puzzles, are a good bribe or go into Tell's equipment. This is because the forest is no friendly environment: wild animals and Gessler's black knights want to eat/arrest him. In this case Tell has to fight his way out without losing too much life energy. It can be restored by using found provisions.

Controls are almost completely icon driven. So for example for walking right, the player needs to click the "go right" icon, to pick something up the "pick up" icon needs to be pressed and so on. This includes the fights in which first the used weapon is chosen and the combat moves are performed when clicking on the appropriate icon. The only exception is the crossbow: when using it, a first-person view replaces the icon bar in which the crossbow is aimed.</desc>

		<desc>Cruncher Factor is a Pac-Man variant. The player commands a cruncher (which looks exactly like Pac-Man) and steers him through non-scrolling labyrinths shown from the side. On every place not occupied with a wall are pills which have to be eaten by rolling over the field they are on. There are also ghosts which cause the player to lose a life when touched - at least until the cruncher eats a special ball which causes him to eat the ghosts. A level is won when all balls are eaten.

The game features 100 levels, a level editor (can be also used to change the existing levels) and a two-player mode.</desc>

***Crystal Kingdom Dizzy*** is an adventure video game featuring the 
character Dizzy released in December 1992 by Codemasters. The 
Oliver Twins—who were heavily involved in the design and programming 
of previous Dizzy games—had less involvement with this one. The game is 
the last title to date in the core Dizzy series.




This was the first full-price Dizzy game released for home computers; 
previous games had been released at budget prices. This elicited some 
criticism, as despite the much higher tag, the game was no bigger or 
more complex than its much lower-priced predecessors.




The Spectrum version was voted number 70 in the Your Sinclair Readers 
Top 100 Games of All Time.

		<desc>How do you make an interesting computer game out of the venerable Rubik's Cube concept? According to cult programmer Tobias Richter, you view it from the top with all sides displayed, and allow the player to choose the number of sides, from 4 to 25.

A large number of different starting arrangements are offered, grouped by difficulty. Rather than having a level-based progression, you can choose any of these from the start. A number of different tunes are provided, written by Team 17 cohort Bjørn Lynne.</desc>

		<desc>Cyberblast puts the player in Fastrax Laboratories where the Trans-universal Portal Experiment in the solar system has gone completely haywire. The player must make it through all 64 levels until he finds the missing control chip. The control chip needs to be found in order to close the portal as it's being open allows for deadly aliens to enter our universe.

The game is similar to Gaunlet, and levels must be completed within a time limit which changes based on level complexity. In order to complete levels, the player has to locate and collect the five crystals and then find and use the exit. Walls, enemies, and other obstacles will impede the player throughout the game and players much maintain a supply of energy units or their game will come to an end. Players can select between two characters at the start of each level. The two characters have different qualities and limitations which make them more or less adept to each different level.</desc>

		<desc>Cyberzerk is a top-down shooter in which the player has to cleanse a big space ship from all inhabitants. This is accomplished by using either the standard gun or a limited supply of grenades. The ship consists of various levels which in itself are divided into non-scrolling rooms which are navigated by using one of the exits of the current screen. The death of every enemy - which mostly move on a set path without actively hunting the player - within a time limit is the requirement for finishing a level.

Getting hit by an enemy causes the life energy to go down and running out results in an instant game over. To counter this, energy refreshments are sometimes left behind by killed enemies. Other extras are grenades and a map which shows the layout of the current level but can be used only once. The co-operative two-player mode features friendly fire.</desc>

		<desc>The pivotal battle of World War 2 is recreated using Impressions' Micro Miniatures wargaming system. You take an overall command of the units by directing them, and can play out the individual battles yourself if you wish. The screen display uses letters to indicate the unit type, with only functional use of graphics and sound throughout.

The gameplay is turn-based, with you selecting each move for your units before activating them and letting the computer do the same. The strategic considerations include the surrounding terrain, whether the enemy forces are fortified and ready for your attack, unit morale, unit fatigue and remaining movement points. At higher difficulty levels your orders may not be followed to the letter, as the more ambitious or arrogant generals attempt their own plans.</desc>

		<desc>In this sequel to the game Mercenary, the planet Eris is in danger: A comet, fittingly named "Damocles", is on a straight collision course with the planet. Within only a few hours, the comet will obliterate Eris.

It is your job to prevent this. In the maddeningly short time frame, you will have to explore the galaxy (which contains 9 planets and 19 moons) and try to find a way to stop the comet.

Just like Mercenary, you play this game in the first person perspective, this time however with detailed filled polygon graphics. You can walk on the planets, drive vehicles and fly spaceships. It is very non-linear, you can go to any planet and any moon at any time and do whatever you like. You'll have to find and use objects and examine buildings and places... and stay away from Eris if you can't destroy Damocles in time!</desc>

		<desc>In the third game in the Dan Dare series, Dan has been kidnapped by the evil Treens, lead by Dan's arch enemy, the Mekon. He is taken to their scientific satellite orbiting Venus, but it doesn't take long for Dan to break free and go down into their ship. While searching it, he eventually finds an escape shuttle sitting in the launch bay, only to discover that it is out of fuel. He returns to the satellite in an attempt to find some.

The fuel cans are scattered around the five levels of the ship, which Dan can get to by using the Mekon's teleporters. To get to them though, Dan needs to destroy any Treen that get in his way using a variety of weapons, bought by using a computer terminal. Along the way, the Mekon can be seen sitting around, and destroying him will more often than not reward Dan with a pod that he needs to access the teleporter. Dan can use his jet-pack to navigate the satellite, but this will eventually run out of fuel.</desc>

		<desc>The Black Knight has brought misery to the land, and the end way to end this is to enter his haunted house to slay him. You are the brave adventurer taking on this quest through 14 increasingly-tough zones.

The bulk of the game is side-viewed, involving single screens to pass through, which incorporate ropes, cages and trapdoor. There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical. The screens were linked by hub screens, which the player passes through simply by clicking on a door.</desc>

		<desc>Dark Seed is an adventure game which capitalizes on the drawings of famous horror designer H. R. Giger as a source of background artwork and inspiration.

You play Mike Dawson, an ad company manager who, in pursuit of his goal in life to become a writer, purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills. Although the low cost and hush-hush transactions when purchasing the house do raise your suspicion, the solitary environment and sheer beauty of the house crush common sense and you decide to buy the house. That's when trouble begin. Upon reaching the house, you suddenly feel tired. You find a bed and fall asleep...

... and wake up from a terrible dream, only to find out that your life has just become a worse nightmare: an unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in your mind, and you only have three days to find a way to stop it.</desc>

***Darkman*** was developed by Twilight and published by Ocean Software 
in 1991. It was released for the ZX Spectrum, NES, Amstrad CPC and 
Commodore 64. It was also ported to the Game Boy and Atari ST. The 
game's plot is loosely based on the film of the same name.
















In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a 
superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope 
during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman 
disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before 
the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman 
wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his 
disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to 
sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member 
of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well 
as their face.
















In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can 
make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a
picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time 
Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level 
is the most faithful to the film, and takes place on a skyscraper 
under construction. After the player defeats their mirror image five 
times and wipes out the mob cartel that scarred Darkman, the final 
boss is inexplicably a clone of Darkman himself.
















The Spectrum version was well received critically, with CRASH magazine 
awarding 82%, Your Sinclair gave 85% and Sinclair User 78%.

A number of quests unfold as you aim to complete the task, with people offering to help if you collect a particular artifact, for example. All combat is conducted using a magic blade. Its power level of which is boosted when you kill evil characters, and reduced when you kill good or innocent ones, which extends the feeling of a battle between good and evil.</desc>

Datastorm is similar to the arcade game, [Defender](/arcade/defender). Written by Søren Grønbech, it was inspired by [Dropzone](/commodore-64/dropzone) for the Commodore 64. As such, the exact gameplay deviates from [Defender](/arcade/defender) in that the task on each level is to carry the 8 pods through a portal, with points on completing a level for each one saved. The amount of points increases for each level: on levels 5, 9, 13 and so on, the player gets a new set of eight and the scoring resets.

Like Grønbech's [Sword of Sodan](/amiga/sword-of-sodan), it made full use of the Amiga's hardware at a time when most games were direct ports from the Atari ST; the number of sprites moving smoothly around the screen is noteworthy. Some, including the Datastorm itself, cover almost the entire length of the screen.

		<desc>The Sun League has been trying to fight back against the corrupted and oppressive Gar computer for many years. Now they have attacked a defense base. The only hope is for a Viper V droid to be sent in under your control to reactivate the planet's defenses.

To do this, you must find floppy disks that are everywhere in the station to reboot that evil computer! To complete this task, you must fight 33 types of little robots who attack you. The action is viewed in first-person 3D, with directional arrows on screen for movement and rotation.

There are 25 levels, each of which is automatically mapped as you explore it. Use turbolifts to get to them. Each object is managed by the game, and a notepad feature is provided to allow you to keep track of vital information.</desc>

		<desc>Death Trap is a side-scrolling platform game with light puzzle-solving elements that usually don't go further than finding levers to get through to the next part of the map. The theme of the game is medieval fantasy and it takes place in a castle (divide into five levels) which is where the trap in the title comes from. The trap has been set up by the magician king Shankriya and has been existing for five centuries. It's the players job to make things right again. The game has a wide variety of enemies from ghosts to fireball throwing magicians. Defeating some enemies gives the player the player a flask with some liquid that can be converted into spells and such.</desc>

		<desc>Katakis on the Amiga is, like its counterpart on the C64, a shoot'em'up heavily influenced by R-Type.

It's a single space ship versus the machine intelligences from the planet Katakis in six side-scrolling levels. The R-Type influence is apparent in many ways: from the design of the player's ship and some enemies to the weapons system and even some of the level designs (for example, one level is a battle against a giant enemy ship reminiscent of R-Type's third level).

The player's ship is equipped with a standard forward-aiming weapon. Further powerups to be collected include a three-directional scattershot that can be upgraded from two to eight projectiles. A reflective laser bounces off the floors and ceiling to cause further damage. Also available is an autoseeker and a power shot which must be charged by holding on to the fire button. The R-Type influence on the weapons is most obvious with up to two protection satellites hovering above and below the ship, as well as the R-Ball, an indestructible object that can be docked to the front of the ship and be used as both a weapon and a shield (and thus is basically the same as R-Type's Force).

The game offers a two-player mode, with two players taking turns.</desc>

		<desc>Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf, commonly known as Desert Strike, is a shoot 'em up video game released by Electronic Arts (EA) in February 1992 for Sega's Mega Drive. The game was later released on several other formats such as the SNES, including a much upgraded version for the Amiga home computer. The game was inspired by the Gulf War and depicts a conflict between an insane Middle Eastern dictator, General Kilbaba, and the United States. The player controls a lone Apache helicopter and attempts to destroy enemy weapons and installations, rescue hostages and capture enemy personnel, while managing supplies of fuel and ammunition.

The lead designer, Mike Posehn, had no video game experience prior to developing Desert Strike. Inspired by Choplifter, he aimed to create a nonlinear game with smoothly animated vehicles. Posehn, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, developed a camera system with momentum to mimic realistic helicopter movements. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling was used to generate the vehicle sprites, which were later touched up on the pixel level with color.

Desert Strike was a strong commercial success: it was a chart-topping best seller and at the time Electronics Arts' highest ever selling game. The game also received a favourable critical response, with several magazines awarding scores of over 90%. Reviewers praised the game's enjoyability, mix of action and strategy, graphics and sound. There was some controversy regarding the game's subject matter, with commentators criticising it as in poor taste due the proximity of its release to the recently ended Gulf War.

		<desc>Detonator is a Breakout variant with 50 levels. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen which can be moved left and right and is used to bounce a ball into the playfield (respectively keep it from falling down).

The goal is to clear the field of all destroyable blocks in it which is accomplished when the ball hits them. Some blocks have to be touched multiple times before they break (this in indicated by changing colours) and others leave behind extras which float towards the bottom and have to picked up to activate them. Examples include a bigger paddle, a laser, multiple balls at the same time or the computer taking control over the paddle for a short time.</desc>

		<desc>Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a 2D shooting gallery.

In the early 90’s, two things just wouldn’t die: Bruce Willis in the Die Hard trilogy of movies, and, well, 2D point-and-click shooters. Renowned software undertaker Grandslam was happily ready to dig the grave several inches deeper for both. The spade: a game called Die Hard 2: Die Harder.

Based on the 1990 movie Die Hard 2, the program sends you through five stages modelled after key scenes of the film. As N.Y. cop John McClane, you have to shoot terrorists invading Washington’s Dulles airport by quickly aiming a crosshair at them. You’ll successively clear the luggage center, airport annexe and runway, then chase after the bad guys on a snowmobile and finally shoot it out on the wing of the terrorist’s plane. Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, several tougher bosses will appear. Occasionally, civilians cross the room and pray that you don’t kill them. Most dying terrorists drop power-ups, namely med-kits, armour, grenades and weapons that are more powerful or fire faster. You collect these items by shooting them in time. If you do not aim fast enough, the terrorist’s bullets will drain your health; you may die three times, but after that, John McClane bites the dust once and for all. Until you restart, that is.</desc>

		<desc>Disc is a game of fast reflexes and clever thinking.

Control one player against the computer or another person. The objective is to finish off opponents by knocking him off the platforms or by making the platform disappear by hitting the walls behind your opponents. Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it!

As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</desc>

		<desc>Think you've played chess before? Even those who are experts at computer chess should take a look at this game. Modern chess is only one variant offered—it has 10 versions of chess rolled onto one disk. Beginning in modern era, the program works its way back in time. The authors mined gaming history books for versions of chess that most people have probably never heard of, both modern and ancient varieties.

The list of chess variants included are: Shatranj, Medieval Chess, Turkish Chess, Decimal Chess, Los Alamos Chess, Courier Chess, Chaturanga, Chinese Chess, Burmese Chess, and Byzantine Chess.

The oldest game on the disk is Chaturanga, a variant invented more than 1000 years ago in India. More recent versions include Medieval and Turkish Chess, played in the middle ages. Decimal Chess, which has a piece that combines a knight and a queen, is a modern variant of an older game. The newest game of the group is Los Alamos Chess, which was designed to run on a MANIAC I computer with a 6x6 board. Strangest looking of the games is Byzantine chess, which has a circular chess board.

This is not just a chess game; it is more of a survey of chess history. The authors provide the histories of the games to place them into context with modern chess. They show how chess changed as it moved across cultures. They cover the basics of chess—the rules, moves—and give players a glossary with chess terms. Finally, they include a bibliography for those who want in-depth information.</desc>

		<desc>Ditris is a straight Tetris variant without gameplay additions besides a split-screen multiplayer mode. Differently shaped blocks fall from the top of the screen and can be turned and moved left and right on the way to the bottom. The goal is to create full horizontal lines which vaporize after completion: more lines at once reward more points for the high score. The next block is shown in a preview screen and the game is over when a block can't fall far enough to leave the top of the screen.</desc>

The first level is a vertical shooter level with your ship only in its basic configuration. The later levels are horizontal scrolling and there you get your chance to improve your efficiency by collecting various power up ranging from speed-ups to tail cannons.

Typically, each stage has a final boss who needs a lot of firepower to be beaten.</desc>

		<desc>Donald Duck's Playground won several awards from educational software magazines as best educational game of the year. In it, you are Donald, working to earn money, which you then spend to buy playground equipment for your nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie to enjoy.

The first job is to guide the Amquack Express around a top-down map with 8 stations, setting the junctions to ensure that packages are delivered to the correct stations. His job in produce involves catching fruits as they are thrown at him and placing them in the correct basket. At the toy store he must sort items by shape and colour, and be careful with the security switch. His final job is at an internal US airport, soring products based on their location's delivery code.

The equipment for the playground must then be purchased and arranged, helping young minds get an appreciation of money management and cash-handling.</desc>

		<desc>Double Agent is an enhanced clone of well known 8-bit computers hit Spy vs. Spy. The game features numerous mission where the player competes with another human player or computer in the execution of the assignment. The tasks require carrying out specific actions before opponent, f.e. retrieve documents and escape from the building, find a camera and make photographs, kill other agent. In each location various items (heavy ball, electrical device, lit cigar) can be found that can be used for setting creative booby traps inside plants, desks, file cabinets and other furniture. All traps can be disarmed with objects found in the rooms. Contact with a trap takes some of the energy. Another difficulty is the third agent that appears after some time pledging traps and attacking the other two. Each agent has a shotgun, which can be used against the enemy. Death means the loss of all items and moves the agent to the initial position.</desc>

		<desc>Princess Alicia of the kingdom of Mitgult is kidnapped by the monster Zawell. It's now up to the heroic warrior Amul to transform himself into a blue dragon and go and rescue the princess.

Dragon Spirit is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which consists of nine stages. Players fly around and destroy everything in their path. Much like in Xevious, action takes place on two planes, both in the sky (where the dragon is flying) and on the ground. The dragon has two different kind of attacks: fire that shoots up the screen, and fire that drops to hit a place on the ground in front of the dragon. Enemies exist both in the air and on the ground, and some can fly up from the ground to the sky.

Players can pick up power-ups, or upgrades, that will help them in their fight. Upgrades can include extra heads on the dragon, health, faster shots, and more. At the end of each stage is a boss that needs to be defeated. Having good upgrades that are not lost from being hit before reaching the bosses will help.

The NES version is unique in that it presents a somewhat altered story and an additional gameplay mode. Technically, it is a sort of sequel, with "A New Legend" being its subtitle. In this version, Zawell is already defeated and King Amul and his now wife Queen Alicia, have two children named Iris (a princess) and Lace (a prince). A new evil named Galda has decided to attack the Earth. Galda also has taken Iris captive and now Lace must go rescue her.

The NES version also adds a new initial stage. If the player survives it, the game continues in a "Blue Dragon" game much like the original arcade game. If the player fails to clear this initial stage in one life, an easy mode called "Gold Dragon" begins, skipping about half the game's stages, giving the player extra hit points, and features a different ending.

Also of note, the TurboGrafx-16 version's seventh and eighth stage are different than the other versions. The underwater and dark themed stages were changed to castle interior themed stages.

		<desc>Dragon Tiles: The Tournament is a sequel to the original Dragon Tiles and like that game it is a mahjong solitaire game like Shanghai. The objective of the game is to remove tiles from a stack by matching tiles with the same emblem. Only tiles that have an empty place at either their left or right side can be removed. The main difference from the original game is that it's not only possible to remove two tiles at a time but also sets of four, six or eight tiles. The more tiles that are removed at a time the more points will the player earn. Another difference from the first game is that the play field is larger than the screen size which means that the display scrolls when the mouse cursor is moved.

The game consists of 75 levels and space for 25 more that can be created with a built-in level editor. The appearance of the game can be customized with different tile types: crystal, stone, wood and copper. There are also different emblem sets to choose from: the ones from the original game, as well as flags, runes, Chinese symbols and cards.</desc>

		<desc>A variant on Shanghai, the ancient Chinese tile game, released when the official Amiga version was long unavailable.

A number of different types of tile are used, with 4 of each. These are arranged in a particular way, with some on top of others and some next to them. The idea is to remove pairs of tiles progressively so as to leave none remaining. However, a tile can only be moved if it has nothing on top of it, and has free space to either the left or right of it.

This version has 18 different tile layouts, and the tiles have modern pictures on them, ranging from Ghostbusters and Batman logos to computer chips and patterns of atoms, which makes the tiles more disttinct and colourful, and takes the game out of its old-fashioned context.</desc>

The protagonist has to ride a dragon, find 40 artifacts and bring them to the corresponding places. The artifacts can only be dropped at the correct location.

Of course there are enemies which try to stop the player and can be destroyed by using the dragon's fire breath. Besides the artifact collecting, the game plays out as a traditional multi-directional scrolling shooter. There are five levels with eight artifacts each.</desc>

		<desc>The prophecy has been fulfilled. The world shall be ruled by the dragons. On an island far away, their lords prepare for the conquest of the lands. There is only one hope for mankind. The emperor sends out four heroes -- warriors and magicians -- to solve the puzzle of tears and prevent the invasion of the Drakkhen.

Drakkhen is a role-playing game with a visual presentation that combines 3D landscapes and 2D interiors. The player's party will travel overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the player has to find a way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen. Party members are depicted in four status windows on the left side of the screen, thus allowing to see their current status and equipment at once.</desc>

		<desc>Eco is an action strategy game of sorts, which sets the player in charge initially of a small single-celled organism and challenges the player to guide its evolution.

The initial tasks are to roam around finding food and then find a potential mate. Depending on the organism's status, different predators will be after it - a radar is displayed to indicate where these are at any given time. Once this is done, the player is taken to a screen displaying the species' genes, and has the chance to modify one of them, thus resulting in evolution. Eventually the organism can evolve far enough to become plant, insect, fish, or even human.</desc>

		<desc>Cornelius the Elf was living peacefully in a forest with his sweetheart Elisa. However, an evil creature known as Necrilous the Not-Very-Nice kidnapped Elisa and disappeared with her. Cornelius must embark on a perilous journey to rescue the love of his life.

Elf is a platform action game with light adventure elements. Cornelius is armed with a ring that fires projectiles at enemies. During the course of the game he can collect herbs and animals (called "pets"), which can be traded in shops for upgrades such as stronger attacks, extra speed, magic spells, or devices such as a flying machine. In addition, certain segments require the player to communicate with NPCs populating the game world and fulfill their requests, usually by obtaining specific items for them. 

The game keeps track of the player character's behavior, assigning the player a rating and affecting the ending scene depending on the protagonist's actions, which mainly involve killing or sparing the lives of the game's non-hostile characters. The protagonist's health is measured in hearts and lives, which can be replenished or increased. The player can save the game between stages.</desc>

		<video>./snap/Emmanuelle.mp4</video>
		<desc>The plot of Emmanuelle is loosely inspired by Marayat Rollet-Andriane (Better known as Emmanuelle Arsan)'s Emmanuelle books, as adapted by Muriel Tramis. The character Emmanuelle in the game is a wife of French business man whose job requires constant travelling, thus leaving his wife unfulfilled. Emmanuelle has taken a lover, Marc, but later suffers pangs of conscience, because she still loves her husband. Emmanuelle travels to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, to escape him, but is followed by Marc. The aim of the game is to augment Marc's erotic potential so he can seduce Emmanuelle again.

The player's 'erotic potential' is increased by following the three laws of eroticism: law of numbers (seduce as much ladies as you can), law of asymmetry (try to seduce an odd number of ladies) and a law of surprise (seduce preferably concealed/masked ladies). Furthermore, the player should find three erotique statuettes. There's not any hardcore scenes present in the game, but Marc might catch Emmanuelle disrobing while looking through a certain keyhole, although more often he will see only an old gentleman washing his feet.

		<video>./snap/Empire Strikes Back.mp4</video>
		<desc>The Empire Strikes back is the sequel to the brilliant arcade game Star Wars.  While it shares many of the earlier game's characteristics, somehow it doesn't come off quite as well...

The Empire Strikes Back has four levels. The first has you blasting away at Imperial Probe Droids and their transmissions as you try to stop them notifying the Empire. The second level has you trying to bring down Imperial walkers, either by shooting them through the view slits, or by casting tow cables at their legs. The third level is eerily reminiscent of the first level of Star Wars: shoot TIE fighters and their fireballs. The final level is just annoying. You steer through an asteroid field.

The game as a whole includes many classic sound effects and samples from the movie, but as a whole it lacks the appeal of the earlier game.</desc>

		<desc>>**ESCAPE FROM PRISON CAMPS HAS CEASED TO BE A SPORT**




>Colditz Castle was the most dreaded of all the POW camps in World War II - with a reputation of being totally escape proof.




>This is the story of those men who refused to concede defeat, the indestructible prisoners of war who, against all the odds, managed to escape and make their way to freedom. By ingenuity, cunning and sheer daredevil bravado they achieved the impossible, and their heroism has rightly passed into the annals of history…




>Now comes your chance to try to match their courage and determination as you attempt to guide your four men to freedom. You will need to utilise many of the objects you find contained in the castle and avoid any sentries or patrolling guards.




>You must plan your escape route and collect the relevant equipment in order to be successful. By using all of your men you will discover ways to divert the attention of guards, set up ‘stooges’ to warn you of approaching patrols and unearth the various means of escape.




>* Accurately reproduced map of Colditz Castle containing over six hundred rooms to explore and discover.
>* Control four different characters simultaneously.
>* 50 grames a second.
>* Independently moving intelligent patrols and guards.
>* Full screen scrolling.
>* Numerous objects to collect and use
>* A massive, interactive, original concept in gaming.
>* Based on the highly popular board game by Gibson Games.

		<desc>Eskimo Games takes the winter sports multi-event format and emphasises the winter rather than the sports. Operation Snowball is similar to the arcade game Cabal insofar as it resembles Operation Wolf but adds a roll manoeuvre. You must fire snowballs at people who are trying to make a catapult, and destroy the shots they aim at you.

Eggsterminator places you at the top of a cliff, which has 5 ledges containing a bird’s nest. Birds will periodically land on these and lay eggs, which you must collect. Contact with the birds themselves causes you to fall and lose time. Ice N’Igloos involves using your axe to collect ice, and taking it to your incomplete igloo to complete it. Avoid the seals, as contact with these costs you time.

Miami Ice is a clone of Tapper, except that instead of beer you are serving ice cream to people. From one side of the screen you must ensure that each line has enough ice creams sent down it to match the number of people coming. Also ensure that you are ready to collect the empty cones when these are returned. Evidently, the taste of wafers is not popular near the poles.

The final event is not present on the C64. It is Barbearian, a one-on-one fight with a polar bear. The ice melting away sets the time limit in this game.</desc>

		<desc>The 1992 olympic games took place in Barcelona, Spain, and the corresponding computer game came from Ocean: The Games '92 - España. The sports simulation boasts an impressive variety of diciplines, divided into three sections:

Track and Field: running, relay, hurdles, steeplechase, discus, shot putt, hammer throw, javelin, long jump, triple jump, high jump, pole vault;
Water Sports: free style, breast stroke, back stroke, butterfly, relay, diving;
Fighting: boxing, wrestling, judo, fencing.

Eliminating the different distances in single events (such as 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle), though, The Games' "over 30 events" melt down to 22; and counting only those which differ to some degree in their execution, it boils down to six: running, throwing, jumping, swimming, diving and fighting.

The Games '92 is divided in three parts: During preparation time, manage and train twelve athletes by sentencing them to gym time and daily practice. Game time advances with each action until the olympic games begin.
In pactice, heats and finals, you take control of your athletes and drive them to peak performances through rhythmical tapping of the cursor keys, and the occasional press of the space bar.
In the database section, you can read up on previous games and winning athletes, and take a look at Barcelona location maps.</desc>

		<desc>Crime is getting out of control in Liberty City, and to combat the problem, the LCPD establishes a new unit, called ESWAT (Enhanced Special Weapons and Tactics). Police officers who are promoted to this unit wear a cyber-suit that contains state-of-the-art military equipment including two Turbo-Booster Thrusters, extra ammunition, and increased protection. In order to become an ESWAT member, all a dedicated police officer has to do is arrest enough criminal masterminds to progress through the ranks, which include Captain, Assistant Chief, and Chief.

ESWAT: Cyber Police is a horizontal-scrolling beat 'em up where you have to make your way from left to right and defeat a mastermind. There are 15 stages to complete, and have you patrolling through Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, restaurants, the CBD, construction sites, and boat docks. While you're out on patrol, you can pick up ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. Once you have obtained the cyber-suit, you wear it for the duration of the game.</desc>

		<desc>The game represents the most powerful European teams of 1992 season. England, Germany, Scotland, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, France, and Sweden propose the best teams of their premier divisions such as Bayern München, Manchester United, Celtic, Ajax, AC Milan, Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Monaco, IFK Göteborg, etc. for player's choice.

Gameplay flows in side view, where soccer players are controlled either by human or CPU. There are two modes of playing. The first one is "Friendly match" for 2 players (playable only if a joystick is installed along with keyboard). The second one is "Euro Cup tournament" for 1 player. Different options such as match length (2/4/6/8 minutes), weather conditions (wet/dry), formation of the teams (4-4-2/4-3-3/4-2-4), and national anthems (on/off) may be adjusted.

Simulation of the players` team actions lies in the following. When the ball is near the player of your team, this player is selected as active and becomes controllable. As this player you should run to the player of the opposite team and take the ball, after that you may run with the ball, which is stuck to your feet, give a pass to another player of your team, or strike the ball. Your player may be moved in 8 directions. Your goalkeeper keeps your gates by himself. Camera follows the ball but with some delay, so the ball is often not in the center of the playscreen as well as nearest player of your team is not visible.

There is no ability to save the game in progress. So tournament should be played from the very beginning 'til the end during a single game session.</desc>

		<desc>This football game aims for a higher level of realism than most of its contemporaries. The game can be viewed top-down (similar to the Kick Off games) or side-on (similar to Manchester United Europe). Three different passing modes are offered, with the aim of providing precise one-touch passing or the ability for long-range direct through-balls. The match options include 10 skill levels, variable wind, five different pitch conditions, and variable match lengths. You can play league and cup tournaments featuring up to 32 of the game’s teams, which are taken from the top clubs in top European countries.</desc>

		<desc>Tecmo's World Cup '90 arcade game was remodeled based on the 1992 European Championships for its home computer release. The tournament's structure of the time (2 groups of 4 play each other once, top 2 go through to semi-finals followed by a final) is recreated, with any of Europe's soccer nations available to be chosen as those 8, and 1 or 2 human players choosing their team, playing on either keyboard or joystick.

The matches are played from a side-scrolling perspective. The ball sticks to the player's foot, and can be kicked or passed with a press of the fire button. The referee is fairly lenient when it comes to tough sliding tackles, although fierce contact will result in a free kick being given.</desc>

		<desc>European Football Champ was released to coincide with the 1992 European Championships. The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op's close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.

Although the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.</desc>

		<desc>A simple little game that is a later reworking of the ancient game, Thrust. With the full effects of gravity and Newtonian physics in action to make control more challenging, you fly around a side-scrolling level shooting enemies and avoiding contact with the scenery.

There are a few additional twists. You must collect bits of a key (which you need to be able to kill the baddie at the end), and pick up prisoners (whom you can then torture to learn the whereabouts of other bits of the key). There's also a shop where you can sell your prisoners as slaves (provided you haven't tortured them to death) in return for powerups for your ship.</desc>

		<desc>The Archmage Khelben summons the Heroes of Waterdeep, slayers of the Beholder Xanathar, for another mission. Strange things are happening in the forests near Waterdeep, centered around the Temple Darkmoon. People have been disappearing and shallow graves containing human remains have been found. Khelben teleports the party to the forests near Darkmoon so they may find out what kind of evil is working in the towers of the temple.

Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon is, like its predecessor, a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game based on the second edition of AD&D rules. It uses the same point-and-click gameplay mechanics and controls as the first game, with only minor changes. The game is set entirely in pseudo-3D maze-like areas; no automapping is available. Combat flows in real time, and characters can move as a single unit to lure enemies or avoid blows.

A starting party consists of four characters, which can be transferred from the earlier game or created from scratch. Six classes (Fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Cleric, Mage, and Thief) are available. Characters can reach higher levels and learn new spells, must face new and tough monsters, and solve multiple puzzles. Compared to the first game, many more illustrated NPC encounters and cutscenes were added.</desc>

		<desc>F1 Tornado is a flight combat game played from a first person perspective unlike the 8-bit game with the same name which is a side scrolling game. The game contains three dimensional vector graphics and the player takes control of the titular fighter plane in missions over the Persian Gulf and other locations.

The aircraft moves forward by itself and the player's control is limited to steering, climbing, diving and shooting. When an enemy appears within the player's view the head on computer automatically locates it and locks on target and the player simply has to press the fire button to shoot it down. In additional to the primary machine gun attack there is also a missile attack that is initiated by holding down the fire button. Enemies includes most commonly aircrafts but also ground targets such as installations, tanks and gun emplacements. While playing it's necessary to keep track of the plane's damage and fuel levels. At times collectibles will appear and picking these up will recharge some of the fuel or repair some of the damage.</desc>

		<desc>F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult.

There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want.

F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.</desc>

This is made a little easier by the fact that your turbocharged Ferrari F40 can do over 300 MPH.

There are many forks in the road, with arrows at the top of the screen indicating which route is quicker. Any high-speed contact causes the car to blow up, but you have an infinite supply of these, and the only real penalty is the lost time. There are lots of road blocks to swerve around. The police are after you - pay attention to the sirens and stay out of their way.</desc>

		<desc>Fallen Angel is a side scrolling fighting game similar to Double Dragon. You play the fallen angel, sent on a mission to locate the leader of a drug distribution network. Beginning in the London underground, each level will present you with two tasks to complete: find a plane ticket to reach the next level, and destroy the ring leader of the area. To do this you will need to fight the (often well armed) thugs found in the various underground train stations and on the trains themselves. Each level consists of several stations; when all the thugs in a station are defeated, you may get on the train to go to a different station. The plane ticket you are searching for may be found in any one of these stations, and the level boss will be found in the last station. You are free to complete these two tasks in any order you choose, and don't need to visit the stations in any particular order. Fallen angel has the ability to perform a variety of kicks and punches to deal with the bad guys, and can occasionally pick up weapons.</desc>

		<desc>Fast Lane! is a racing game, simulating the C-1 championship. It has nine tracks, including Horama, Le Mans, Suzuka and Donnington. There is a practice mode in which you can get used to the gears, which can also be set to auto transmission. Many options on the car can be tweaked, for example the angle of the front and rear spoilers, the tires and more. A detailed damage model can be shown and also fuel settings can be changed (you can reduce the amount of fuel in the tank).

Before a race, you have to qualify by getting a good time during three rounds on the empty racing track. Depending on the qualifying time you start in the field. The graphics are displayed with zooming sprites, and the track is not flat, but features some hills that limit the view of the further road. Despite the car options, this game is not a real simulation but plays like an arcade racer.</desc>

		<desc>Winwood was just an ordinary man, an owner of a small record shop - certainly not a very suitable profession for someone who would become a hero in a magical land. But fate had its own plans for our hero. One day, feeling particularly drowsy, Winwood closed his shop and fell asleep on the sofa. Soon his dream turned into a nightmare: he realized he was trapped in his own dream world, a fantasy land with mages and ferocious monsters, unable to wake up. An old man named Naristos explained to him that a mysterious mage known as Thardan has been terrorizing the land for a long time. Thardan's power might be the only solution to Winwood's predicament. As a traveler between the worlds, Winwood alone stands the chance of getting close to Thardan, and perhaps ridding the magical land of his tyranny.

Fate: Gates of Dawn is a first-person role-playing game with turn-based combat, similar in visual style and gameplay to Wizardry and Bard's Tale games. The player can recruit up to 28 characters, resulting in four parties that can be controlled separately. A notable feature of the game is a day/night cycle with weather effects that influence the behavior of the world's inhabitants. For example, less creatures will venture outside if it is raining; the player can choose to cast the Rain spell to reduce the number of hostile encounters.

There is a total of 32 different character classes in the game; many of them are traditional (like Wizard or Cleric), but there are also many exotic ones, such as for example Nymph, Banshee, Valkyrie, and others. Each class has abilities and spells associated with it. The world of the game is inhabited by eleven races, each with its own background history.</desc>

		<desc>Fernandez is a despot who has invaded the Republic of El Diablo, bringing terror to the local people. The rightful leaders of the country have called you in to destroy Fernandez's hideouts and bring his country back to the people.

Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken on, with finding good shielding spots and launching surprise attacks an especially useful strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited but collectible grenades to use. There are landmines to avoid, and medical packs to pick up.

On each of the 8 levels you must destroy Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through an underground network of tunnels. You're not limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep and can also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player mode you can split driving and gunning duties. When starting a new game, you always start from the point at which you died in the last game.</desc>

Collecting herbs to cast spells is the main basis of the game. There are 24 herbs and flowers to be collected, which are used to make one of 12 spells (the herbs are only used for 1 spell, so there’s no need to decide which spell you’d prefer to have access to). You can use a combination of the spells (including a teleporter, invisibility and a fireball, which you must work our how to use). Leanoric’s direction relative to yourself is indicated by a compass.</desc>

Progress is made in a fashion similar to that used in Epyx 'games' series, with alternating joystick movements. To help out, you carry a backpack which you may stock with assorted items. Since there is a weight limit, you must choose which items you most likely will need for a given trail. For example, an exceptionally long trail may require camping gear and some additional food, where as a short trail will allow for some more luxuries such as extra rope.</desc>

		<desc>The Final Battle is the successor to Legend of the Sword. In the last game, five heroes managed to foil the plans of the evil wizard Suzar. Now he has returned, captured the party and threw them in his dungeon. The player takes the role of one of the group, with the goal to free his comrades, explore the island and stop the threat once and for all.

The main difference to the predecessor is the isometric perspective and a completely icon-driven interface. To interact with the environment, first a click on the ícon and then on the item or person in the playfield is necessary. The puzzles are inventory-based, but the environment plays a big role in the problems and their solutions: the game features a day/night-cycle and a weather system. The people to be freed have different abilities which need to be used for puzzle solving. Despite the perspective, the current group leader is not on screen and the player is meant to see through his/her eyes.</desc>

***Final Fight*** is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up produced by Capcom. 
Originally released as an arcade game in 1989, it was the seventh 
title released for the CP System hardware. Set in the fictional 
Metro City, the player controls one of three characters—former pro 
wrestler and newly elected mayor Mike Haggar, his daughter's boyfriend 
Cody, and Cody's best friend Guy—as they set out to defeat the Mad 
Gear gang and rescue Haggar's young daughter Jessica.
















The game began development as a sequel to the original Street Fighter 
released in 1987, but the genre was switched from a fighting game to 
a beat 'em up and the title was changed following the success of 
Double Dragon. The Final Fight development team later worked on the 
original Street Fighter II and some of the characters from Final Fight 
later appeared as playable fighters in other entries of the franchise 
such as the Street Fighter Alpha sub-series.
















Final Fight was ported to various home consoles such as the 
Super Nintendo Entertainment System and was followed by a few 
sequels. The total sales of the Final Fight series have totalled 
3.4 million units.
















U.S. Gold released ports of Final Fight for the Amiga, Atari ST, 
Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC for the European market in 
1991. These ports were developed by Creative Materials. In February 
1993, the ZX Spectrum version was released as part of the Super Fighter
compilation with Pit Fighter and WWF WrestleMania.

		<desc>The Norse Kingdom is threatened by the Iniquitous Hel, goddess of Niflheim and purveyor of evil. Thor, the great god of law and order, has been selected by his fellow gods to travel through four Norse worlds in an attempt to stop Hel spreading evil and ruling his people. The journey will be long and ardulous. Hel has sent creatures to meet Thor, delay his progress, and kill him. A variety of pitfalls and traps await him.

To travel between worlds, Thor must collect the four segments of a key that will unlock the exit door. One segment lies inside a building, the rest are outdoors. If he fails to find all segments of the key when he gets to the exit door, then he goes back to the start of the world to search for what segments that he has missed.

Hel's creatures will try to stop him from doing this, but he can deal with them using a variety of weapons, such as fireballs and axes, and he can carry two weapons simultaneously, and can switch between them at any time. Potions can be obtained by destroying the flying creatures that go back and forth each screen. At the end of each world, Thor must defeat a much bigger creature in order to get to the exit door.</desc>

		<desc>Restore peace on earth and collect a high score while doing so in the first one of the Fire and Forget games by Titus. Fire and Forget is a racing game in which you have to complete courses by blowing up various enemies and avoiding obstacles on the road.

The different tracks are located all over the globe. There are six courses within each level of difficulty. You have an infinite amount of lives, but when your car runs out of fuel it's game over. So be sure to pick up those power-ups.</desc>

		<desc>The background story of Fire & Ice is quick to tell: A coyote (you) runs, throwing ice cubes, through various worlds. In the levels you must jump on platforms and kill your enemies. The enemies (for example, birds and penguins) can be shot with your ice cubes; they become frozen, so you smash them. Sometimes they leave part of a key behind after they're destroyed. The complete key, assembled from all the pieces, opens the door to the next world. 

In this "jump & run" you can also get some power-ups. You can find some coyote puppies; these puppies follow you, are invulnerable, and also shoot enemies. In higher regions you find some snow-flakes; enough of these and you get a great snowball for freezing more enemies on the screen.</desc>

		<desc>The Norse Kingdom is threatened by the Iniquitous Hel, goddess of Niflheim and purveyor of evil. Thor, the great god of law and order, has been selected by his fellow gods to travel through four Norse worlds in an attempt to stop Hel spreading evil and ruling his people. The journey will be long and ardulous. Hel has sent creatures to meet Thor, delay his progress, and kill him. A variety of pitfalls and traps await him.

To travel between worlds, Thor must collect the four segments of a key that will unlock the exit door. One segment lies inside a building, the rest are outdoors. If he fails to find all segments of the key when he gets to the exit door, then he goes back to the start of the world to search for what segments that he has missed.

Hel's creatures will try to stop him from doing this, but he can deal with them using a variety of weapons, such as fireballs and axes, and he can carry two weapons simultaneously, and can switch between them at any time. Potions can be obtained by destroying the flying creatures that go back and forth each screen. At the end of each world, Thor must defeat a much bigger creature in order to get to the exit door.</desc>

		<desc>In First Contact, a communication space station is overrun by aliens. The player takes control over the maintenance droid with the goal to keep the station running as long as possible. The aliens will destroy vital part of the station and the droids need to repair them. There are also other important tasks like getting repairing equipment out of lockers or refueling. 

The player does not control the droid directly, but programs a script which is then performed independently. If the droid is interrupted, they stop the program and don't fight back. It has to be manually restarted by the player. To be more effective, the droid can be split into three droids with different abilities which have to be programmed individually. The game ends when all droids are disabled by the aliens, but if only one or two are down they can be repaired. There are four decks which can be reached through teleports.</desc>

		<desc>Joe King is the hero of this point and click adventure. His plane is carrying actress Faye Russell when it crash lands in a remote jungle, and he must battle through 100 screens of adventure and puzzle. The game's feel is influenced by hammy B-movies, and the characters are quite stereotyped and comic. As standard in point and click adventures, a set of icons at the bottom of the screen allow you to interact with visible characters and items in the main view area.

		<desc>Flip-it & Magnose, the title characters of this action game with strong puzzle elements, live on Mars. Unfortunately the planet has not exactly the biggest water resources of the universe and so they are sent to Earth to get some. In the vertically scrolling platform levels the player has to solve puzzles by collecting objects and using them at the right place respectively giving them to the right people. However, the water is not given directly, but there is a water drop which has to be caught by using the water catcher object. The goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of water within the time limit.

The player character can't die, but loses fruit when he falls too much of a distance. Fruit can be collected when wandering through the levels and are used between the six levels to buy traps which have different effects (and of course different prices), e.g. wasting a bit of time or reversing the controls. This is useful because the two Martians don't work together and try to beat each other's water score. There are also other items to collect which are not directly related to puzzle solving, like a spring for long jumps and objects which help against special hazards in the level. Collecting pills is a bit of a gamble because they can either add or subtract points on the water or fruit counter. The game uses a split-screen; one half for each Martian. In two-player games, the second Martian is controlled by player two.</desc>

		<desc>Your homeland's precious limited energy is being taken advantage of by the evil Thargoid Empire, and you and your spaceship must do something about it. There are 8 bases to enter, with the aim of using energy pods to cause the reactors to overload and thus malfunction.

The game is viewed side-on, resembling the ST classic Oids quite strongly; which is to say that gravity and motion physics dictate the ship's motion strongly. The 8 levels all have plenty of enemies on offer, both wall-mountings and actual ships, as well as enhanced weapons and extra fuel and shield energy. The ship can take some damage, and repairs itself over time (for no logical reason), which is one of the few things that gives you a hope of getting anywhere early on. Losing a life causes all the enemy turrets to replenish, emphasizing the restart points and making things more maze-based and methodical.</desc>

		<desc>Football Manager from Addictive was the first game of its kind, and this sequel followed several years later, absorbing ideas from the many similar games released in between. Teams can now choose formations, and assign man-to-man marking. Players have individual skills and fitness ratings, in a more realistic way, with half-time substitutions and tactical changes supported. The whole 92-club league is incorporated, as is the League Cup alongside the FA Cup. It is now possible to watch and assess the individual performance of the players, with match graphics differentiating the attack / midfield / defense areas more clearly. Training allows passing length and height to be specified.</desc>

Guiding your character around the screen as they fly with jet-packs, guns on full auto, you control a satellite which you rotate around your character for the direction in which your gun is firing. At the end of each level is a boss which needs to be killed to progress.

Enemies that have been killed drop money. At the end of every level is a shop where you can buy weapons, armour, items and first-aid packs.</desc>

		<desc>Formula 1 Grand Prix (known as World Circuit in the US) is the first installment of Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix series. The game includes all 16 international GP circuits of 1991. Players may drive them in quick race mode, single race or a full championship. The 18 teams and 35 drivers and their performance are based on the 1991 season, but the game doesn't include real names. It is possible to edit and save team and driver names by hand.

The extensive tuning feature influences the performance of the car. In-race setup allows players to adjust gear ratios, brake balance, wing downforce and tires during each visit to the pit box. Six optional driving aids help F1 rookies finish their race: players can toggle best line and suggested gear displays to learn track tactics, or have auto brakes, auto gears, self-righting spins and indestructibility to improve their driving. A replay system allows players to watch race scenes from three different views, including track-side camera footage.

The game features 3D graphics and various details and effects such as working rear mirrors, collisions with flying debris, crude damage models (wings are visibly bent after crashes), and wet weather that influences traction, including a fog effect that obscures vision when driving in another car's splash water.</desc>

		<desc>he player is taken the role of Zak, a prisoner in a planetary prison called “Waste”, and of course, you have to escape. Stealing a space craft, you fight your way through the guarding forces.

Foundations Waste is a vertically scrolling shoot-'em-up, in which you have to collect extra weapons, like a side shot, shields, a drone which can be controlled by the inverse control of the player ship and some kind of seeking missiles. Sometimes the power ups are fakes, inverting your control or slowing your ship down. You loose all extra weapons either on dying or on entering a new level.

The enemy forces are tanks, ships, flying vessels and later even space ships. Each level is featuring an end-of-level guard, which can be destroyed for extra points, but can even passed if your fire-power is too low at that moment.</desc>

You prowl the rooms of the mansion searching for victims. You have to dodge the Crucifixes thrown at you and sink your teeth into anything that looks tasty. Once you've drained the blood of all your victims, you can proceed to the next level. Keep an eye out for the unhealthy as they will drain your lifeforce; too much bad blood and you're a dead vampire. You can run back to your coffin if you're low on health to regenerate, as well, you must be back in your coffin before the sun comes up, or you're a toasty vampire.</desc>

		<desc>Full Metal Planete is a tie-in of a board game of the same name. Up to four players land on a planet with their motherships, trying to gather as much ore as possible within 24 game rounds.

This almost sounds like a happy, idyllic round of pick-the-flowers, if it weren't for the truckload of tanks and destroyers that each players happens to have in the cargo area of his mothership. So the players usually spend an equal amount of time picking up ore and bashing their contenders' heads in. 

The computer game is an accurate conversion of the board game; virtually every feature is present. Strategy is needed to succeed in the game. The only semi-random thing are the tides (high tide, low tide, and something in-between) which can strand boats and engulf tanks, but even they can be partially predicted.</desc>

To find the bomb pieces, many enemies and their spawning points must be destroyed. Barriers block the access to other levels and keys must be found to open them. Certain areas can only be reached by the ground craft which is not as powerful as the fighter, however - some careful planning is required.</desc>

		<desc>One of the first Speedball clones takes the basic court layout of basketball as its inspiration. There are 5 players on each team, on a small court with 2 and 3 point shooting areas. The difference is that physical contact of a fairly violent nature is allowed, and the court is littered with mines and bombs to wound the players. Shooting involves holding down fire to get the height right, so avoid being tackled as you prepare your shot. Other basketball rules such as double-dribbling and the 25-second hand-over are unsurprisingly waived. A 3-division league is included to progress through.</desc>

And while he was at it, he also added some guns. So now his goal is to drive and kill people who move slower than him (which is everyone). Killed enemies leave behind money which can be reinvested into vehicle upgrades between levels. A life is lost when the energy bar is completely drained, so it is advised to dodge obstacles and vehicles. Movement is restricted to left and right; the speed can't be regulated.</desc>

The game has 32 levels and was one of the first games using 32 colours (5 bitmaps) simultaneously outmatching all the Atari ST games that were limited to 16 colours. Furthermore the games used the Hi-Res graphics mode of the Amiga for the first loading screen. This had not been used in a commercial game on Amiga before.</desc>

		<desc>A lot of creatures called fuzzballs, are released in an old wizards castle by his young apprentice. The young man is also turned into one of the fluffy creatures himself, by accident. The old wizard gets a little upset, and orders the apprentice to get rid of the fuzzballs swarming all over his castle. If he succeeds, the wizard will turn him back to human form again.

This is a platform game, with 50 levels. To complete each level, you'll have to collect all the treasures, while at the same time avoiding, or killing, various enemies. You will face mostly other fuzzballs, but also other creatures. Each level is only a single Bubble Bobblish screen, but can take a while to complete anyway.

Touching an enemy once means instant death, and if you don't complete a level in time, you will be killed by mosquitoes entering the screen. To succeed in Fuzzball, you'll have to plan every move carefully, otherwise you'll die very quickly.</desc>

		<desc>Einstein, Newton and Darwin are the Galactic Warrior Rats, mutant hybrids who come under your control in this top-down multi-directional shooter. Their plan is to save the badly polluted planet Smeaton Five by destroying its robotic defences and the computer primed to explode it.

Many enemies must be shot down along the way, but most release credits when shot – wait a few seconds for these to appear. You have three lives, with each rat representing a life, which means that all upgrades are lost when you lose a life, and each rat’s protective biosphere has the ability to withstand a few shots. Before heading into the action, you can spend your initial 500 credits on upgrades and weaponry. Your movement features a degree of inertia, making it harder to stop short of a position.</desc>

		<desc>Galaxy 89 is a Galaga clone. The player controls a spaceship that can only move left and right at the bottom of the screen. The aim of the game is to destroy as many enemy waves as possible without losing all of the extra lives.

Pressing the fire button fires a shot at the enemy attack waves, which enter the screen from different edges. The only other movement possible for the player is a diagonal shot, by moving the controller in the opposite direction they want to fire. The game gets gradually harder with waves appearing behind the player or large amounts of enemy shots the player has to avoid.

Having its roots in an arcade game, the objective of Galaxy 89 is to gain the highest possible score. Destroying waves of enemies gives the player points, as well as the bonus rounds considering mostly of cannon fodder-type enemies that occur after clearing a certain number of waves.</desc>

You will have to fly freely before cutting through tunnels and canyons, and finally destroying an alien base. Your energy read out starts at 1200 and decreases as shots hit you, or you make contact with a wall or blockage. You have infinite cannons and guided missiles to help you along. You can get regular energy recharges and power upgrades, by shooting and then collecting their carrier pods.</desc>

		<desc>This strategic action puzzle game features original gameplay. You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.</desc>

		<desc>Gary Lineker's Hot-Shot! is a soccer game in which two teams try to win the match. The adjustable options are the number of players, the time of a half time and the AI level. The game is played in a top-down view and only shows a part of the playfield.

The player either controls the athlete in ball possession or, when in defense, the one which is nearest. When shooting, the power of the shot depends on how long the button was pressed and the direction changes with the joystick movement, e.g. moving against the walking direction results in a overhead kick.</desc>

***Gauntlet III: The Final Quest*** is a home computer game by U.S. Gold 
and Tengen it was released in 1991 for the following systems; Amiga, 
Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC. It was released one 
year after Gauntlet: The Third Encounter which was for the Atari Lynx. 
Besides the standard four main Gauntlet characters, Thor, Thyra, Merlin, 
and Questor, four new playable characters were available: Petras, a rock 
man; Dracolis, a lizard man; Blizzard, an ice man; and Neptune, a Merman.
The game is viewed from an isometric perspective and includes a 
two-player cooperative multiplayer mode.




***Gameplay***




Gauntlet III is an original game with an isometric projection type 
view that would later be used in Gauntlet Legends and other Gauntlet 
games made after Legends. Its view is much like that of Solstice and 
games made with the Filmation engine. The player walks around various 
areas of each kingdom, with five areas for each of the eight kingdoms 
giving a total of 40 areas.[4] The locations can be traversed from one 
area to the next. Places like the forest and castle dungeons have 
obstacles such as logs and tables blocking the player's path, 
creating a maze-like area. Each area has at least one doorway 
or pathway to the next. At times certain things must be done 
in order to advance into the next area. To avoid the player being 
lost the programers created a hand that appears from time to time, 
holding a note to remind the player what they are supposed to do; this 
clue feature is also an option to call up the clues. Another feature 
programed into the game is a combination lock key code for which the 
player must consult a code wheel packaged with the game, needed to 
open certain doors; if someone made a pirated version of the game 
they wouldn't be able to get past that portion of the game without 
the Combination Key.




The enemies in this version, as in other Gauntlet games, come mostly 
from generators that keep producing the enemies until the generators 
are destroyed.




Other elements from the series also make an appearance, such as 
potions that make enemies disappear or weaken them, food (both good 
and poisonous), invincibility amulets, and treasure chests, some of 
which can contain traps or other items the player would need.

		<desc>This top-down puzzle game starts with a screen featuring a number of red cogs at different parts of the screen, and a grid of pegs (which become less complete on later levels). Your task on each level is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the pegs are linked together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats.

Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name ‘Poffins’. One of these goes around removing pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, or have gears placed over them to stop them.

There’s also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game rather than fruit.</desc>

Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up system. Instead of gaining occasional tokens which lead to lasting weaponry improvements, occasional flurries of tokens are released to ensure a quick burst of improved fire. The organic backgrounds are detailed, and have many sections which fire at the player character.</desc>

As in the previous games in this series, the player is observing the battle area through a 3D perspective, while issuing commands by typing in certain pre-defined text elements (combined with names of commanders, places and time of execution). You will get reports from your officers indicating whether or not your orders have been carried out to the letter.</desc>

***Ghostbusters II*** is the title of a video game released for several home 
computer and console systems. The game is loosely based on the film of 
the same name.
















All home computer editions were published by Activision. Each home 
computer game edition of the game is essentially similar, with changes 
in the quality of graphics and sound. 
















The DOS version is completely different from the other ones, having been 
developed by a different company, Dynamix with game design by 
Doug Barnett.
















***Gameplay***
















Most version of the game feature several arcade sequences based on the 
film: Van Horne: the player controls Ray Stantz as he is lowered into 
an air shaft of the disused Van Horne subway system to collect a 
sample of slime. He is armed with his proton pack and other weaponry 
with which to defend himself against the myriad of ghosts that attack: 
some will collide or grab him and cause damage, while others will 
attempt to cut his rope. The player must collect the three segments 
of the slime scoop, as well as ammo and health, during the descent. 
















Journey to the Museum: the Statue of Liberty has been brought to life 
by "mood slime" and is marching toward the Metropolitan Museum of Art; 
the player controls a floating fireball (generated from the Statue's 
torch) which fires horizontal shots and must be used to protect the 
Statue from swarms of ghosts. Impacts from ghosts (or regeneration 
of the fireball) uses up precious slime, though it can be replenished 
from destroyed ghosts. 
















Showdown in the Museum: the player controls the four Ghostbusters 
individually, armed variously with proton packs and slime dispensers, 
in an isometric 3D level. The four heroes must rappel into the Museum 
and fight Janosz, Vigo the Carpathian, and finally a possessed Ray, 
in order to save the world. 
















Some versions also feature a sequence based on the courtroom fight 
against the ghosts of the Scoleri Brothers.

***Ghosts 'n Goblins*** is a 1985 side-scrolling platform game developed 
by Capcom for video arcades and has since been released on several other 
platforms. It is the first game in the Ghosts 'n Goblins franchise.




***Gameplay***




Ghosts 'n Goblins is a platform game where the player controls a 
knight, named Sir Arthur, who must defeat zombies, ogres, demons, 
cyclops, dragons and other monsters in order to rescue Princess Prin 
Prin, who has been kidnapped by Satan, king of Demon World. Along the 
way the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses and extra suits of 
armour that can help in this task.




The game is often considered very difficult by arcade standards and is 
commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games ever released. 
The game is considered by Gametrailers.com to be the world's second 
most difficult game ever made. The player can only be hit twice 
before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur's armour, and the 
player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level, 
or finding replacement armour). If the player loses a life, he is 
returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has 
managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a 
certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock 
being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the 
player instantly loses that life.




After defeating the final boss, but only with the cross weapon 
(if the player does not have the cross weapon, they will be prompted 
that it is needed to defeat the boss and restart at the beginning of 
level 5 and must repeat round 5 and 6 again regardless if the weapon 
is obtained immediately or not) for the first time the player is 
informed that the battle was "a trap devised by Satan". The player 
must then replay the entire game on a higher difficulty level to 
reach the genuine final battle.








The Commodore 64 version, released in 1986, is known for its music by 
Mark Cooksey, which borrows from Frédéric Chopin's Prelude No. 20. Due 
to the limited resources on the Commodore 64, it was somewhat different 
from the arcade version. It only features the Graveyard and Forest, The 
Ice Palace, The Floating Platforms and Firebridge and The Caves in that 
order. The player also starts the game with five lives. The demon that 
kidnapped the princess replaces Astaroth in the title screen. 
Additionally, the cyclops (or "Unicorn") is the boss of levels one to 
three and the dragon is the final boss.




Ghosts 'n Goblins was also ported to the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, 
Atari ST, IBM PC compatibles.

***Ghouls 'n Ghosts*** is a platform game/run and gun developed by 
Capcom and released as an arcade game in 1988, and subsequently ported 
to a number of other platforms. It is the sequel to Ghosts 'n Goblins 
and the second game in the Ghosts 'n Goblins series.




***Gameplay***




The gameplay for Ghouls 'n Ghosts is similar to that of Ghosts 'n 
Goblins. The player controls the knight Arthur, who must advance 
through a series of eerie levels and defeat a number of undead and 
demonic creatures in his quest to restore the souls stolen by Lucifer 
(Loki in the English-language Mega Drive and Sega Master System 
versions), including the soul of his lover, Princess Prin Prin. 
Along the way, Arthur can pick up a variety of weapons and armor 
to help him in his quest. While the core gameplay remains the same 
as its predecessor, the game now allows Arthur to fire directly 
upward and directly downward while in mid air.




By jumping in certain spots, players can cause a treasure chest to 
erupt from the ground. By firing his weapon at the chest, players may 
uncover new weapons, gold armour or an evil magician that changes 
Arthur into an elderly man or a helpless duck. The gold armour allows 
players to charge up the weapon to release a powerful magical attack. 
Each weapon has its own special attack.




There are five levels and Lucifer's chamber at the end, considered a 
sixth level in itself. To defeat the game, Arthur must complete level 
1 to 5 twice. Upon completing level's 1 to 5 the first time, Arthur is 
taken back to level 1 again but this time a special weapon appears 
during the game. To enter Lucifer's chamber the player must have this 
special weapon equipped and defeat the penultimate boss.




Ports of Ghouls 'n Ghosts were released in Europe in 1989 for the 
Amstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. 
These ports were all handled by Software Creations and all omit a 
great deal of detail from the arcade version even on very capable 
16-Bit machines like the Amiga.

		<desc>While watching television, Giddy learns that an alien spaceship has descended over Cutesville. It starts to send strange waves that modify the behaviour of objects. Suddenly the TV transforms into a jar of pickles. Giddy decides to fight the menace, and return his homeland to normality. But first, he is going to eat the pickles.

Giddy 2 is an Amiga freeware clone of Dizzy and its sequels. Intended as parody of that classic series, it also stars an anthropomorphic egg that must collect objects in order to solve puzzles. On the top screen there are three heart-shaped energy bars for the three lives of the character. If the egg touches any of the enemies, this energy bar decreases, and when it is completely drained the egg explodes with an onomatopoeic "SPLAT!", and the player loses a life. On the top-right side there is the accumulated number of coins collected by the character. Below both items is a black strip that displays the inventory content when in use mode (pressing the space bar enters the use mode, where the player moves the joystick left or right to cycle through the assembled inventory, and hits fire to use the selected object).</desc>

Each level has a set amount of fruit, all of which must be collected by crossing its path, before reaching the exit. This must all be done within a time limit, and many levels involve collecting keys to unlock doors which are located elsewhere. There are enemies after the first few levels, who must be killed by hitting them, then their eyes must be collected as they wander off. You can withstand 7 hits on each life, but losing a life resets the level.</desc>

		<desc>Gobliiins is a puzzle game with adventure elements, in which the player controls a team of three goblins: Oups, Ignatius and Asgard (Hooter, Dwayne, and BoBo in the US release) to find four magic components. A voodoo doll has turned their king Angoulafre mad and by collecting the components they can track down Niak the Wizard, the only one who can make things right. The player needs to solve various puzzles by combining the different skills of the three goblins. It's possible to switch between them and control them separately. Most of the puzzles are based on coordinated actions. One of the goblins can cast powerful but erratic spells, another can collect and use objects, and the last can hit things. Action icons are activated at the bottom of the screen. 

The game takes place in 22 stages, each of which has puzzles that must be solved in order to advance. The characters have limited energy, which can be sapped by traps.</desc>

Someone has kidnapped the prince and it's up to you and two hilarious sidekicks, Winkle and Fingus, to rescue him. Winkle is a reckless jokester, while Fingus is careful and has a gift for solving puzzles. Luckily, they're blessed with extraordinary vitality. In other words, they never die. That'll sure come in handy when you're up against Wily Wizard's traps, maniacal monsters, and twisted and perplexing puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>In Gold Rush!, Jerrod Wilson (the player character) receives a letter from his long-lost brother (who fled the city years before when was hastily accused and convicted of a crime he didn't commit) asking him to join in Sacramento, California. If that's not enough for Jerrod sell everything and give his hometown Brooklyn a fond adieu, under the stamp was one of the first nuggets of Californian gold seen in the Atlantic shores of the United States. So, Jerrod bids farewell to his peaceful life as a newspaper editor, and becomes a fore-runner in the the great Gold Rush of 1849, hoping to find his brother and "strike gold" (literally).

Released late into the lifespan of Sierra's AGI engine, Gold Rush! features some tricks not seen before the more advanced SCI engine, such as enlarged characters, but it is best known for the three routes available to reach California: by land, travel by boat to reach the Atlantic shore of Panama, cross the isthmus, and then get a second boat in the Pacific shore, or making the dangerous all-boat trip by Cape Horn. Each route has its dangers: Cholera might strike as you make your way across the Northern states or your boat might sink. As usual with Sierra adventures, instant killing happens if the player is careless, but will also happen at random. Other important (and innovative) concept is the game being timed. If Jerrod takes too long to leave Brooklyn, passages to California increase in price, and his house devalues.</desc>

		<desc>The Golden Path is a point and click adventure game. Instead of using verbs like in Maniac Mansion, the player controls the monk with the mouse by moving a cursor shaped like a Chinese letter and clicking directly at him on the screen. Left-clicking on a spot on the ground moves the monk towards it. Left-clicking below Y'n Hsi makes him bend over to drop or pick objects on the ground. Left-clicking above his head makes him try to use the object he is holding at the moment (if it is not possible to do so, a question mark appears). Right-clicking makes him punch and kick, his defense against enemies. Every time the monk is hit, the inventory briefly flashes. A book sits at the bottom-left of the screen, and serves as a hint system of sorts. When clicking on it, a message about the screen appears with explanations to events, characters and objects. Besides the book is the inventory with four slots for objects. Left-clicking on an object places it on Y'n Hsi hands. Above the inventory is a slowly withering vine as the energy bar. It grows with the completion of certain tasks. 

The main objective is to follow the golden path. Literally. On the bottom-right of the screen there is a small version of the main game screen that shows the path and its bifurcations. The character moves from screen to screen collecting things laying around, fighting the occasional enemy and using the right object at the right place.</desc>

To do so he flies through 16 vertically scrolling levels, called platforms, to shoot down the transporters carrying the robots. Then he collects the robots (the capacity is up to five at a time) flies to the teleporter station, unloads and repeats until all robots in the level are captured or destroyed. Well, it is not that easy: every destroyed transporter causes recovery ships - basically enemy fighters and mines - to show up, which need to be destroyed first.

		<desc>In Goofy's Railway Express, Goofy and Mickey are railroad conductors helping children with colors and shapes. This is done by a series of screens for young children to start visually identifying shapes and color matching while the train crosses colorful landscapes.

When the train smoke stack produces colored shapes, such as a square, circle, or triangle, the child must press the spacebar key. If the shape and color matches the shape and color above a Disney character waiting on the train platform, then the train will stop and pick up that passenger. Otherwise an unique animation appears somewhere on the screen for entertainment.</desc>

		<desc>Graeme Souness Soccer Manager is a basic football managing game based on the English leagues where the player is responsible for bringing a team (any available) from the Conference to the top division.

Options are limited: the player can select the starting eleven, the players being rated in both ability and fitness, explore the transfer market for signing better players and request overdraft extensions. While no player refuses the sign for your team (even if it's still on the Conference), the real game challenge is to balance finances, and avoid paying too much in wages while still in the lower divisions.</desc>

		<desc>The most important feature of Graeme Souness: Vector Soccer are the three-dimensional vector graphics. To accompany this, the camera perspectives are relatively near to the playfield; a small overlay of the whole field which is shown in the right corner is required to get an overview.

The rest of the game offers no surprises: the player takes the role of a soccer team, either during a friendly match or a tournament, and tries to win. The athletes are directly controlled and are able to perform actions like shooting or passing. There are various match settings available, e.g. difficulty level or match length. In multiplayer mode, either two players play against each other or up to eight players are responsible for one team each during a tournament.</desc>

		<desc>Although Graham Taylor was the England international football manager at the time this game was released, the player starts a management career managing in Division 3 of the league, and have to work your way up, either by improving your squad (much as Taylor did in his successful spell with Watford, who he took from the 4th tier of English football to the top division and the FA Cup Final) or by doing well enough to earn a job elsewhere. Once you can finish in the top 5 of the league, you get a password to load the international management game, in a manner similar to many of Dinamic's games.

The standard features of football management games are included, such as player transfers, team selection and organising training. You have a team of scouts who can be sent out to investigate other clubs, giving ideas on potential signings and helping you plan for future matches. A full squad of young players who could potentially challenge for the first team are on offer as well.

You can directly interact with your players, and also recieve newspaper reports assessing your team's performance. The matches are represented by fully-animated match footage, which is of a comparable visual standard to Krisalis' arcade football games.</desc>

		<desc>A motorcycle racing game recreating the now-defunct 80cc world motorcycle racing championship. It was licensed around Spanish ace Jorge Martinez 'Aspar', and your (and his) racing rivals including future 500cc World Champion Alex Criville.

The game features a full practice mode as well as qualifying and races. There are only 8 computer bikes, although the real life championship points system is used, meaning that the penalty for not finishing is bigger than in real life, especially as you only have 5 bikes to last the season. The game is viewed from overhead, and the controls are, unusually, direction based, so to take a straight which (in the overhead view) involves going up and to the right, you must push the joystick in that direction.</desc>

		<desc>Gravity Force is a game of dexterity. Your task is to pilot a small spaceship through a series of mazes and collect various cargo containers on your way. Your spaceship obeys the laws of gravity. You have to use a single thruster to avoid collision with walls or the ground. Various types of enemies will try to hinder your cargo salvage missions.

The single player part of the game consists of a total of 49 mazes. After each five successfully finished levels you will receive a password that allows you to choose the corresponding level as your starting point in the main menu. The ten highest scores achieved will be permanently saved on disk.

There are three other game modes available: Race, Two Pilot Race and Dogfight.

    In Race mode you can choose one of 10 available tracks and try to achieve the best times. You'll have to avoid obstacles similar to the ones found in the single player mission mode, and a crash means that the race is over. If you succeed in achieving a track record it will be saved permanently also.
    Two Pilot Race offers three different tracks. The screen is splitted into two parts. Your only task is to reach the finish line before your opponent. If you crash you'll be respawned at the starting point.
    Dogfight offers two tracks where you can fight against another player.</desc>

There are different tournaments to choose from, such as all APT tournaments and the Davis Cup. Prize money is provided by doing well in a tournament. The game supports both single and double matches. In the training mode you can play against a ball machine or against a friend. There are different settings to program the ball machine, for instance to practice a certain type of shot. It is also possible to have matches with one player competing against two.</desc>

		<desc>Grid Start is a Formula 1 racing game played from a third person perspective similar to Pole Position. The game consists of six tracks based on real world locations: Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Belgium, Mexico, Austria and Germany. These can be played in a competition consisting of three laps or in a practice mode with 99 laps (or until the player presses the escape key). In each race there are 23 AI controlled cars to compete against. The game is playable in three difficulties: novice, amateur and professional. The car has six gears that have to be changed manually and a boost feature can also be used for faster acceleration. In addition to racing faster than the opposing drivers the player also has to avoid crashing into the haystacks and the fences that are placed dangerously close to the track.</desc>

		<desc>Hostile All-Terrain Encounters await in this shoot 'em up notable for it's unusual diagonal scroll, which is similar to Costa Panayi's previous Highway Encounter series. As nobody is qualified to take the enemy on, your task is to complete the 30 levels of training (the actual war could've been the basis for a sequel, although this never happened).

The levels alternate between controlling a Star Fighter plane and a Ground Assault Vehicle; the latter is faster but is confined to ground motion. The plane can move up and down to make dodging the simulated enemy fire easier. This generally comes at you in waves, although there are also ground installations.

Central to the game is to shoot at the cases of plasma crystals, and then fly over these so as to carry them to the end of the level. Dying loses you one of these crystals if you have at least one, or a life if you do not. Completing a level with at least 2 crystals is effectively a restart point as well, as when you die you are sent back to a level in which you collected at least 2.</desc>

		<desc>Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers is a real-time strategy game. It is the sequel to Hacker.

Once again you hack into a computer system, just to end up saving the world. Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the "Actisource" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again, involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden.

In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras. Whew, sounds like a lot of work? It is.</desc>

		<desc>Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.

Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...</desc>

		<desc>Hammer Boy is an arcade game that plays like a cross between Kaboom! and Whac-A-Mole.

Armed with a big hammer, your job is to prevent the American Indians from reaching the tower behind your fort by hitting them on the head and putting out the fires that are thrown from the side. That's really it to the game -- new levels bring different backgrounds (battleship, castle and space base) with corresponding enemies (pirates, knights and aliens), but essentially the same gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>In a grim future, the people are kept under control by a horde of genetically-modified beings who look identical to everyone else, and appear to act the same, but are subtly controlling minds and actions. This works perfectly for Centro-Holographis until two of their droids, Hammerfist (male) and Metalisis (female) malfunction. They try to put things right, and come under your control in this side-view action game with adventure elements.

You can switch between the two characters at any moment, and must use this wisely as their abilities differ greatly. On each screen you must kill all enemies, as well as taking out the robots which keep the doors locked.</desc>

		<desc>Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. 

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. 

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</desc>

While most Harpoon scenarios from that era were hypothetical NATO vs. USSR encounters, this BattleSet also featured historical mission based on 1991 Gulf War.</desc>

		<desc>This multi-genre military action game puts player in the seat of tactical commander of mechanized forces. Starting as Cadet, you'll raise your career from the rookie, when you should perform actions by yourself in different vehicles, to the ultimate elite, when you should act as a Tactical genius.

There are three kinds of combat simulations:

    MBT (main battle tank M1A1 Abrams), where in first-person view you should sit in tank's cockpit, command your gunner and driver, and eliminate surrounding enemies;

    FAV (fast attack vehicle XR311), where in third-person view you should drive your vehicle in desert, shoot scattered obstacles and enemy helicopters, and avoid the bombs dropped from the skies ;

    ADAT (air defense anti-tank M1132A), where in first-person view you should shoot air and ground enemies, surrounding your statical position.

Performing useful actions in each mode, you'll gain points, and gathering 5,000 points in each mode will give you a seat of Tactical Commander. Here you'll be able to continue your actions on the field, or perform some tactical moves using the map, which is very similar to the territory, including and surrounding Western Germany.</desc>

		<desc>You play as Heimdall, a demi-god based in Norse mythology. Heimdall's job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. 

Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these worlds to collect the god's weapons.

The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants) and the third is Asgard itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.

When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.

The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard).

Once you've done this it's time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god's missing weapons.</desc>

With his weapon he shoots everything that moves and uses teleporters and holes to find his way. The other levels are horizontally shooters in a top-down perspective. The player controls a space ship, moves through the levels and shoots everything that moves. Killed enemies may leave symbols behind which give advantages when picked up.</desc>

***Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance*** is a video game 
released in January 1988 for various home computer systems and 
consoles. The game is based on the first Dragonlance campaign module 
for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, Dragons of 
Despair, and the first Dragonlance novel Dragons of Autumn Twilight. 
Heroes of the Lance focuses on the journey of eight heroes through 
the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth, where they must face the ancient 
dragon Khisanth and retrieve the relic, the Disks of Mishakal.




***Gameplay***




Heroes of the Lance is a side-scrolling action game. The game used 
actual Dungeons & Dragons statistics, with statistics for the 
characters exactly as they were in the rule books. Eight heroes 
from the Dragonlance novels series must be assembled for the quest, 
and only one is visible on the screen at a time; when one on-screen 
hero dies, the next in line appears.




While Heroes of the Lance is a faithful representation of the books it 
is based on, it was a departure from the usual role-playing video game 
style of most Dungeons & Dragons games, and many players lamented its 
difficult gameplay interface[citation needed] which consists of using 
one character at a time in horizontally scrolling fighting. Each 
character has different types of attacks and spells making them more 
suited to fighting different enemies but they merely act as "lives" 
for the player as in more traditional fighting games, removing one of 
the main strategies of role-playing games from the game.

		<desc>The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted into an isometric-viewed role playing game in which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.</desc>

		<desc>In Highway Patrol II, players assume the role of a police officer trying to capture runaway felons before they reach the county border. Players begin by choosing a target villain, with tougher ones earning a bigger bonus, and making it easier to achieve promotions. Gameplay is from the officer's viewpoint, looking through the windshield of his cruiser.

Players chase the criminals and must get them to pull over by using intimidation (siren) or force (shotgun). Players navigate to the criminal's whereabouts by use of the compass and map. Chasing the villain often means venturing off the road and driving through the desert. Traffic is the most obvious hazard in the game, contact with innocents cost promotion points. Other difficulties include: a flat tire, gangsters shooting back, running out of gas, or engine failure due to heat.</desc>

		<desc>Hill Street Blues is a top-down action / strategy mix.

Based on the ‘80s TV drama series Hill Street Blues, this game puts you in the role of Captain Furillo of the Hill Street police department. Crime rates are soaring in the precinct, and it’s up to your team of nine officers (all well-known from the series and with digitized portraits) to keep the streets safe.

Your officers move on foot or by car on a 2D top-down map of the city, complete with real-time traffic. True to the series, each day starts with a roll call from Sgt. Esterhaus. Once on duty, listen to radio operator A.J. Hill report crimes every few minutes. Deploy officers to the scene, help the victim and call an ambulance or coroner; next, identify and find the suspect. Some criminals may flee, others even shoot at you. Give chase or open fire if necessary. When the bad guy is arrested, a court trial may follow.

Hill Street Blues is controlled entirely with the mouse via a set of icons – that’s everything but intuitive, especially when directing a single officer through the streets. Since there will soon be multiple crimes all over the city, the challenge is to co-ordinate multiple officers simultaneously and keep track of cases and suspects. If your success rate is high enough, you will ultimately be promoted to chief of police.</desc>

		<desc>Play a would-be hero in the city of Hillsfar, where action and adventure await the daring adventurer. Join the local guild and complete missions from the guild master in a quest for glory and gold!

Hillsfar is a single-hero role-playing game (in comparison to other Advanced Dungeons & Dragons role-playing games, where the player usually controls a group of characters). A combination of first person perspective (when traveling in the city of Hillsfar) and third person perspective (usually in some action-style mini-quests) viewpoints.

As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated mission-based plot: fighter, thief, cleric, or magic-user. Each class to a certain extent, have different assigned quests given by each respective guild.

In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various mini-games that are needed to complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild by the guild master. These mini-games (and their viewpoints) include:

    Fighting in the arena (third person).
    Competing at the archery range (first person).
    Exploring buildings or mazes (top-down).
    Riding a horse outside Hillsfar while avoiding obstacles (third person/side-scrolling).
    Locking picking doors and chests (first person). 

Unlike most role-playing games, there aren't any randomly generated monsters to battle. In Hillsfar, combat only occurs in the arena.</desc>

		<desc>Hole-In-One Miniature Golf provides an overhead view of each hole. The game play is controlled entirely with the mouse. You place the ball on the starting pad and click the left mouse button. Once you have placed the ball, "stretch" a line from the ball to the pointer. The direction the line is pointing is the direction the ball will go. The length of the line or the distance between the pointer and the ball is relative to the power on the shot. Once you are satisfied, click the left mouse button to putt the ball. 

You are allowed to go three shots over par. Any more than that and you will get a penalty stroke and must advance to the next hole (or player). You can also get one stroke penalty for going into a water hazard. Your scorecard will be displayed after the first nine holes but can be viewed at anytime using the Options Menu. After completing the course the scorecard will be displayed again. You can print your scores or exit to continue. 

The game features five complete 18-hole courses with different themes including a Tutorial Course that walks the player through every aspect of game play, a Classics Course which is patterned after the basic traditional miniature golf course, an Intermediate Course that adds more obstacles, elevations and difficulty, an adventurous Fantasy Course with designs ranging from castles to pinball and the Expert Course for those who master the game. The game can be installed on a hard drive.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the famous animated series created by Hanna-Barbera Productions about sweet blue dog Huckleberry 'Huck' Hound that speaks with southern drawl and wants to find the appropriate job.

So Huck as amateur Hollywood actor should complete many acts in the different scenes (Under World, Sea World, Canyon World, and Sky World), which may be available later by entering the proper code, using three takes.

The goal of gameplay is to clear each level of diamonds (increasing your score), hearts (increasing your bone energy), and Oscar (increasing your score also) jumping from the bottom of the level to its top and vice versa. Different obstacles such as lethal drops, flying balls, sticky, icy, or moving ground, teleports, inhabitants of the four Worlds, etc. are present on your way, and your jumping skill allows you to avoid them. Your take is finished if you loose your current bone energy. 

Highest score will be stored. After completing the game once you may replay it again, but the gameplay will be harder. Bonus level is also available.</desc>

		<desc>The player controls a soldier in a large three-dimensional world where he can move freely by walking, swimming or using various vehicles such as cars, vans, tanks, ships, bicycles, helicopters, hovercrafts or even rowboats and surfboards. Each vehicle type has its unique properties. The game world also features a large variety of buildings, most of which can be entered and explored. Other in-game characters include enemy soldiers, civilians and animals such as seagulls, sharks and cows. The player also has a wide range of weapons ranging from a regular pistol to SAM-missiles, grenades, land mines and timed explosives. Surrounding terrain can be surveyed with aerial observation units and radar. Food and money can be used to bribe and gather information from other characters. Target coordinates can be recorded into a log book, and the player can see his position in the game world on an overlaying map.

Hunter features a rather sophisticated AI for its time. In addition to shooting, enemy soldiers can also drive vehicles and track the player down. Guard towers, tracer guns, cannons and SAM launchers have the ability to shoot towards the player, and homing missiles launched by the enemy accurately follow the player's vehicles. Birds can also flock around the player, which can cause them to get killed by a vehicle.

The game is controlled mostly via joystick and mouse. The joystick controls the directional movement of the character, and the mouse is used in the selection of weapons and items. Keyboard can be used to give input and zoom the view towards or away from the character.

		<desc>Hybris is a classic vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which has its roots firmly with arcade stalwarts like Capcom’s 1942.

The back story takes place in 2461 A. D. and concerns an Earth colony being lost on an alien planet known as Jurica. The space station Hybris cannot establish communications with the colony. So a scout ship must be sent on a rescue mission over this seemingly desolate desert-like expanse to find the colonists, and subsequently return them to safety. Warning: Inbound Hostiles . .!

The game is for one, and the player can select from two Ace pilots - J.P. Maverick or K. Lovett. You navigate the scout ship around the screen at will. The aim is to shoot everything that moves, whilst outmanoeuvring enemy fire. One contends with spiralling waves of alien nasties which move into the play area from multiple direction’s something akin to Galaga, as well as stationary gun turrets & other surface installations that periodically spew projectiles.

At times a power cube bonus will drift onto the screen. Which upon being shot by the player, will reveal a strength upgrade feature for the scout ship. Each subsequent upgrade collected will progressively beef up the ship (which is visually realised in real-time), in turn increasing your firepower. The scout ship can also be expanded on the fly into unique power configurations attributed to which cube bonus has been collected. You also have control of a smart-bomb feature which can relieve sticky situations.</desc>

		<desc>The training as fighter pilot for the Federation took five years. Now you are finished. But there is a final test to master: survive the „Hyperdome“.

The player is thrown in the Hyperdome with his space ship, the landscape is scrolling horizontally, and to survive, you have to shoot everything in sight. Your ship is equipped with a basic laser cannon. Luckily, some opponents drop collectible markers, which increase a counter visible on the right side of the screen. If you reached the weapon or bonus of your choice, you can activate it. There are nine extras available: increased ship speed, increased fire power, double fire, missiles, spread (clears in front), homing missiles, a satellite and a shield. If you loose one of your initially nine lives, the current extra weapon is gone. If you collect too many items without activating a weapon, the count is set back to the first bonus.

Of course, your ship is crashing if the landscape blocks are touched - this is integral part of the design, as some levels build up less on shooting, but avoiding and securely navigating through the many obstacles on the way.</desc>

You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isn’t handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.</desc>

But the Nazis have rediscovered the lost kingdom, and they'll soon have a bomb that can end World War II in fifteen minutes. Unless Indiana Jones gets in their way...
> -- Back of game box

The game is based on the original story from its [graphical point-and-click adventure cousin](/amiga/indiana-jones-and-the-fate-of-atlantis). The plot is set in the fictional Indiana Jones universe and revolves around the eponymous protagonist's global search for the legendary sunken city of Atlantis. Sophia Hapgood, an old co-worker of Indiana Jones who gave up her archaeological career to become a psychic, supports him along the journey. The two partners are pursued by the Nazis who seek to use the power of Atlantis for warfare, and serve as the adventure's antagonists. 

You start off in a casino in Monte Carlo, where you must beat the house and get enough money to purchase artifacts and weapons. Then, you need to escape the casino (not via the front entrance) and get aboard a submarine to start looking for the lost Atlantis.

Apart from the same high-level plot and the fact that it share the name with the adventure version, this game bears very little resemblance to it, and the game only loosely follows the Fate of Atlantis story. Don't expect too many adventure elements - though there are some puzzles in the game.

The action game uses an isometric view for the entire game consisting of 6 distinct levels. While the isometric view is refreshing, the graphics does look a bit dated on the Amiga, and especially the title screen is a disappointment with much fever colors used than the Amiga is capable of displaying.</desc>

		<desc>The story of Fate of Atlantis is set in 1939, on the eve of World War II. At the request of a visitor named Mr. Smith, archaeology professor and adventurer Indiana Jones tries to find a small statue in the archives of his workplace Barnett College. After Indiana retrieved the horned figurine, Smith uses a key to open it, revealing a sparkling metal bead inside. Smith then pulls out a gun and escapes with the two artifacts, but he loses his coat in the process. The identity card inside reveals "Smith" to be Klaus Kerner, an agent of the Third Reich. Another pocket of the coat holds an old magazine containing an article about an expedition on which Indiana collaborated with Sophia Hapgood, who has since given up archeology to become a psychic. Fearing that she might be Kerner's next target, Indiana travels to New York in order to warn her and to find out more about the mysterious statue. There, he interrupts her lecture on the culture and downfall of Atlantis, and the two return to Sophia's apartment. They discover that Kerner ransacked her office in search of Atlantean artifacts, but Sophia says that she keeps her most valuable item, her necklace, with her. She owns another of the shiny beads, now identified as the mystical metal orichalcum, and places it in the medallion's mouth, invoking the spirit of the Atlantean god Nur-Ab-Sal. She explains that a Nazi scientist called Dr. Hans Ubermann is searching for the power of Atlantis to use it as an energy source for warfare.

Sophia then gets a telepathic message from Nur-Ab-Sal, instructing them to find the Lost Dialogue of Plato, the Hermocrates, a book that will guide them to the city. After gathering information, Indiana and Sophia eventually find it in a collection of Barnett College. Correcting Plato's "tenfold error", a mistranslation from Egyptian to Greek, the document pinpoints the location of Atlantis in the Mediterranean, 300 miles from Greece, instead of 3000 as mentioned in the dialogue Critias. It also says that in order to gain access to the Lost City and its colonies, three special stones are required. At this point, the player has to choose between the Team, Wits, or Fists Path, which influences the way the stones are acquired. In all three paths, Sophia gets captured by the Nazis, and Indiana makes his way to the underwater entrance of Atlantis near Thera.

The individual scenarios converge at this point and Indiana starts to explore the Lost City. He saves Sophia from a prison, and they make their way to the center of Atlantis, where her medallion guides them to the home of Nur-Ab-Sal. The Atlantean god takes full possession of Sophia and it is only by a trick that Indiana rids her of the necklace and destroys it, thus freeing her. They advance further and eventually reach a large colossus the inhabitants of the city built to transform themselves into gods. Using ten orichalcum beads at a time would enable them to control the water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an impending catastrophe.

Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine with the stones, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and the Nazi troops invade the place. Ubermann wants to use Indiana as a test subject, but Kerner steps onto the platform first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Indiana mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced to step on the platform next but threatens Ubermann to send him straight to hell once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green ethereal being before vanishing completely. Three bad endings see one of the protagonists undergo the second transformation if Indiana could not convince Ubermann to use the machine instead, or if Sophia was not freed from her prison or Nur-Ab-Sal's influence. In the good ending, Atlantis succumbs to the eruption of the still active volcano as the duo flees from the city. The final scene depicts Indiana kissing Sophia on top of the escape submarine, to comfort himself for the lack of evidence for their discovery. Source: Wikipedia</desc>

		<desc>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure is a graphic adventure game, originally released in 1989 (to coincide with the release of the film of the same name), published by Lucasfilm Games (now LucasArts). It was the third game to use the SCUMM engine.

As the game begins, Indiana Jones has returned to his college, after reclaiming the Cross of Coronado. He is approached by businessman Walter Donovan, who tells him about the Holy Grail, and of the disappearance of Indy's father. Indy then travels to some of the places seen in the movie, such as Venice and the catacombs, after meeting fellow archeologist Elsa Schneider. In the process he finds his father held captive in the Brunwald Castle, after passing through the mazelike corridors, fighting and avoiding guards. Then Elsa's double role is revealed when she steals the Grail Diary from Indy.

After escaping, father and son pass through Berlin to reclaim the Diary and have a brief meeting with Hitler. Then they reach an airport, from where they intend to seek the Valley of the Crescent Moon, by Zeppelin or biplane. There are many action scenes, involving fists, and the biplane sequence above Europe, pursued by Nazi planes.

Several key elements of the movie—such as the Brotherhood of the Grail, Indy's friend Sallah, and the Venice water chase and the desert battle scenes (except for small hidden references)—were not included in the game.

		<desc>Inertia Drive is a multi directional scrolling shoot 'em up viewed from a top down perspective. Each of the game's levels consists of a number of gatepods as well as a central installation. The objective is to hit the central installation, but to open up its shields all the gatepods first have to be destroyed. Both gatepods and the central installations have shields with only a small gap to shoot through. In addition to these there are also gate protectors that move after the player in an attempt to crash into him. In addition to avoiding these, the player also has to avoid crashing into the shields as any contact will lead to a lost life. As the title suggests, the ship controls are affected by inertia. This means that once it has started moving in one direction a force in the opposite direction is needed for it to stop.</desc>

		<desc>You play the role of Insector Hecti, a computerised detective who explores and protects computer circuits. You have been sent to the Interchange, a highly sensitive area, which has been invaded by Victor Virus and his gang of bugs. On 50 circuits they have changed the direction of some of the blocks on each circuit and your task is to straighten them all back up. Viewed from above with each circuit shown on screen you must walk along the circuits to the misaligned pieces and turn them back round to the correct position and a ping sounds when it is in the correct position.

As you sort the circuit some of Victor's bugs roam the circuits as well and you can either avoid them, shoot them with limited balls or turn a piece of circuit round when they are next to it to destroy them. Once all the bugs have been destroyed they don't reappear. If you touch a bug, fall through a gap or fall of the edge of the circuit then you lose one of five lives and when all lives are gone it is game over. There is a password provided after every five levels to stop you repeating too many circuits. There is also a clock counting down and the circuit must be completed within the time. Occasionally some items appear to help you and these are extra balls, smart bomb, shield (limited), extra speed, freeze all bugs, extra time and stop timer.</desc>

		<desc>Insects in Space is a side-scrolling shooter with similarities to Defender. Insects killed everyone on Earth except a few babies. This causes the mystical leader of motherhood, St. Helen, to travel to Earth's remains and save the babies. The most important feature of this protagonist is the fact that she is topless and - as prominently mentioned in the manual - "big breasted", but she controls and shoots just like the space ship normally found in those games. 

The levels are side-scrolling and St. Helen can move in both directions. Additionally the levels are two screens high, the lower with a floor and the higher with a ceiling, which can be changed by leaving the current screen to the top respectively bottom. The babies are either positioned at the top or bottom level and are hunted by bees. Those bees pick them up, steal their life energy to create a new monster and drop them to the ground to die. The player's job is to kill the bees and save the babies. To help, a radar shows where in the level a kidnapping is in progress. Babies can be either returned to the ground for points or kept in Helen's grasp to convert them into power-ups eventually. Helen can also summon a dust cloud which teleports her near a bee target.</desc>

		<desc>Intact is a vertically scrolling shooter. The player uses a space ship to fly through four levels. Of course there is a lot of alien opposition to be blasted away with the built-in gun. Every time a full enemy formation is shot, the game rewards it with a credit symbol which needs to be picked up in time. From time to time the player visits a shopping passage in which extras can be purchased from those credits, e.g. a turbo boost, extra lives or weapon upgrades. Those upgrades to not vanish after losing a life. Using a smart bombs also cost credits but don't need to be purchased first. The plot centers around the need to defeat alien invaders.</desc>

		<desc>In a dystopian cyberpunk future, The Dreamtrack Corporation has cornered the entertainment market, selling DreamTracks, dreamed or imagined adventures and experiences which can be enjoyed by consumers. The player is Chad, a DreamTrack Dreamer who has discovered that Dreamtrack Corporation is using the DreamTracks to destroy people's minds. He decides to break into Dreamtrack HQ. To overcome the high-tech security systems, his girlfriend, Kaf-E, agrees to break into the building physically, while Chad enters a virtual reality world, inspired by Neuromancer, in order to hack into and disable the computer-controlled defences.




The action mostly takes place in two modes: a 3D cyberpunk environment and a 2D schematic map where puzzles are encountered. 3D objects in the cyberpunk environment represent objects such as security doors and cameras. To disable the real-world devices, the 3D objects must be destroyed. Puzzle-solving involves determining which objects to disable and in what order. The player must also deal with virtual defences, represented by enemy ships which pose a threat to the player's ability to jack in to the system, and which must be defeated.</desc>

		<desc>Ishar: Legend of the Fortress is the sequel to the Crystals of Arborea. Morgoth and Morgula, the black god and his witch wife who were defeated in the previous game, had a child, Krogh. Their evil progeny is based in the fortress Ishar, which means "unknown" in the elven tongue, and has plans to reduce to population of Kendoria to slavery.

The player takes the role of a traveler who, with the aid of up to five companions, battles through the fortress to defeat Krogh and stop the spread of the powers of chaos. Unlike its predecessor, Ishar is viewed entirely from first-person perspective, and its combat is real-time rather than turn-based.</desc>

		<desc>Ishido is a solitaire board game played with tiles, similar to Shanghai. The objective is to place all of the tiles onto the board and obtain the highest possible score by following specific rules of play. There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the game very strategic in nature. Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question, which is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (four-way match). 

There is also a "construction set" where players can create their own tiles and backgrounds. The game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.</desc>

		<desc>The Island of Lost Hope is a text-adventure with a pirate theme. The parser has standard Infocom-like abilities: it understands pronouns, chain commands,etc. You play a character whose ship was attacked by a pirate called Captain Black. Stranded on a small island, one day you have the chance to infiltrate the captain's vessel and exact your revenge. The screen is divided in 5 parts: - a top-left porthole where the graphics and the odd animation are displayed; - a compass in the center in the form of a skull that can be clicked with the sword-shaped cursor for movement (its use is optional, the player can also type the cardinal points and the up and down directions directly on the parser screen); - a top-right map that shows your current position and the explored surrounding area; - the screen bottom, the larger part of it being reserved for the parser and its messages; - the smaller right-bottom inventory that lists your possessions. No music, but there is some sound, mostly soothing splash noises from the sea.</desc>

Various functioning squares must be used to your advantage. Uniquely these include changes to the ball's size, as well as it's physics. Revolving squares randomly fire the ball off in another direction, and ramps shoot you in the current direction at high speed. Weapons can be collected, as can shields - both of which are required to avoid some of the hazards on show. Black holes are always fatal however.</desc>

		<desc>Jim Power was a hero who one day while travelling through the forest, encountered a dimensional rift into a strange new world. Luckily Jim always travels armed and now he'll need to fight his way past several monsters into a monster stronghold to find his way back home.

Jim Power is a side-scrolling platform game, a side-scrolling shooter and a top-view shooter game depending on the level. Jim Power for the most part can jump and has an upgradable gun weapon. He must find fight enemies, bosses and obtain various keys to progress through the levels. Jim also has a "Smart Bomb" power attack which can clear the screen of enemies. In shooter levels, Jim's spaceship only has the ability to shoot and move around the screen avoiding obstacles.</desc>

		<desc>Released to coincide with the 1992 European Football Championships, and licensed around Jamaican-born Liverpool star John Barnes.

The gameplay is superficially similar to Krisalis' previous Manchester United Europe title. The action is viewed from side-on and overhead, giving a slight forced perspective.

Unlike Manchester United Europe, only a small amount of the pitch is visible at a time, which makes the game faster, but makes long-range passing harder (perhaps to make the game more like Barnes' own style).

Control is precise and the ball sticks to your feet to some extent. The only teams included are the eight qualifiers for the 1992 European Championships, and that is the only tournament. You can play either as the nearest player to the ball, or always be Barnes.</desc>

		<desc>Death, pestilence, famine and other nasty things have stricken the once fair lands and it seems that only Asterix the wizard can save the populace from complete despair. Only problem is, Asterix opted out of the rat race some time ago. He now lives along atop a mountain and he is none too keen to receive visitors, so the first task in this keyword-driven adventure is to guide a party of (up to five) characters to Asterix and ask his help.

The screen is divided into three main sections: the top left is given over to small pictures of the various locations, the top right is where the text messages and general location descriptions appear and the bottom part of the screen is where you select various keywords that advance the adventure. The keywords offered for selection depend on the characters in the party, their current situation and the location. So playing the game is very easy and consists of simply reading the messages and deciding which actions to take.

Once you have found your way to Asterix’s abode, the adventure really starts. The quest involves searching through the kingdoms of Dwarves, Elves, Nymphs and other creatures both fair and foul for seven sacred amulets that will enable the wizard to fight the Dread Lord. Progress is generally rapid if a little common sense is applied, but if you are completely stuck the ‘musings’ option at the end of the game hints at actions that you should have taken.

Altogether, Journey is good fun. The keyword system is simple and easy to use and the puzzles are all very logical and intriguing. It obviously won’t appeal to hardened shoot-em-up fans, but anyone who likes games that require thought input will be rewarded with many hours of enjoyment.</desc>

		<desc>Your mission in Jupiter Probe, the latest release from Microdeal is to fly above the surface of Jupiter sending back photographs. However, a hostile race of beings whose only desire is to destroy Earth is trying to stop you from discovering the dark secrets of Jupiter.

The mightiest powers on Earth have united and supplied three scout ships with which to scour the surface of Jupiter. These ships are equipped with twin laser cannons and a limited number of 'advanced features'. These advanced features are Ultrasonics, which cause a disturbance in the area around your ship, thus destroying all aliens in your vicinity, and Shields which protect your craft from enemy fire for a short period of time.

As you can probably tell from the above, this is yet another shoot ‘em up game. In fact it is very much like many other games of this type. Vertical scrolling, nice bold graphics, neat soundtrack, lots of aliens and plenty of action. The many craters, mountains, rivers (on Jupiter!!!?) and ground bases are all well drawn and very colourful, however they appear to be very 'chunky'. The sound is, in most respects, excellent.

The game is very playable as it is just about the right difficulty level for most people, making it fairly hard but not impossibly so. Control is with either mouse, joystick or keyboard. Jupiter Probe is a good value for money game, the price being something which I hope to see more often from both Microdeal and other software companies.</desc>

		<desc>Jupiter and its moons are colonized, and are an ideal setting for motor racing. 3 lap races featuring 3 cars each take place, viewed from above. Weapons which can throw a car off course are commonplace, as are short cuts and speed-boosting pads (which do not always follow a conventional racing line). As well as the races, there are timed money-collecting bonus duels on enclosed circuits.

You are one of the competitors, either in single races or a full season. Money is won for results, and collected as it lies on track. This can be spent on improvements such as engine and armor upgrades, as well as more powerful races.</desc>

		<desc>A space-based resource management game, loosely a sequel to the earlier Utopia.

You start building your community on an asteroid, whose natural resources must be mined and put to use. You must use generators to power the mines and their auxilliary buildings such as storage facilities, which must be maintained. All of this costs money, but the mined resources can be sold or used.

Problems you face include pollution, collisions with other asteroids, worker discontent and alien unrest. Battles against the aliens indigenous to the area must be fought, making building and maintaining a space fleet a priority.</desc>

It's a single space ship versus the machine intelligences from the planet Katakis in six side-scrolling levels. The R-Type influence is apparent in many ways: from the design of the player's ship and some enemies to the weapons system and even some of the level designs (for example, one level is a battle against a giant enemy ship reminiscent of R-Type's third level).

The player's ship is equipped with a standard forward-aiming weapon. Further powerups to be collected include a three-directional scattershot that can be upgraded from two to eight projectiles. A reflective laser bounces off the floors and ceiling to cause further damage. Also available is an autoseeker and a power shot which must be charged by holding on to the fire button. The R-Type influence on the weapons is most obvious with up to two protection satellites hovering above and below the ship, as well as the R-Ball, an indestructible object that can be docked to the front of the ship and be used as both a weapon and a shield (and thus is basically the same as R-Type's Force).

The game offers a two-player mode, with two players taking turns.</desc>

		<desc>Play Keef the Thief, a promising young thief who finds himself on the outskirts of the Mercon the Merchant City. Considering the penalty of thievery is the removal of certain body parts, our young hero must be careful in his profession and ultimately (among others) train himself to access and steal from the city treasury.

Keef the Thief: A Boy and His Lockpick is a first-person perspective role-playing game. It has elements of parody, clearly identifiable from various descriptions in the game and enemy names during combat. One of the goals in the game is to steal everything in sight - at least in the city. The game map itself includes, beside the city, various dungeons, jungles, and an arena, among others.</desc>

		<desc>Kelly X is a space shoot 'em up played from a first person perspective. The player is a pilot working for the Peace Foundation (a future version of Greenpeace) whose task it is to search space for rogue nuke stations that illegally dump nuclear waste. The objective is simple: destroy the radioactive canisters and the stations as well as the guardian fighters that protect them.

The player controls his space craft in a 3D space with the use of either mouse or joystick. The craft moves forward automatically but the speed can be increased and decreased. Moving left and right causes it to rotate while moving up and down causes it to climb or dive. To take down enemies and waste dumps a simple laser gun is fired. Colliding with or getting shot by enemies lead to the craft's shield depleting and when it's all gone it's game over. A hyperspace function can be used to move to a random location but then the shield will decrease.</desc>

		<desc>You have survived a battle in space but your craft is damaged beyond repair and needs evacuating, so in your emergency landing craft you head for the nearest planet. The planet you are heading for is uninhabitable after a giant brain that controlled all life became extinct, but as you approach the surface it becomes clear that this isn't true as you are attacked by various life-forms.

Killing Machine is a top down vertically scrolling shooter where the screen scrolls upwards constantly as you attempt to shoot or avoid various aliens and vehicles over three levels. Getting touched or shot loses you one of three lives and sent to the start of the level you are playing. Certain objects when shot leave behind a power-up which gives you better weapons or a shield which is limited and if you lose a life then you lose your power-up. At the end of level one or two you face a huge Brain Guardian which needs destroying to move to the next level. At the end of the third level is the Giant Brain itself.</desc>

You must keep your people on your side, watching what you say and do, knowing that an overthrow could be hatched at any moment. Look after your woman as well - who's going to respect a single mobster? The money has to be juggled in these ways, not forgetting to reach an 'understanding' with the Mayor to avoid any negative attentions.</desc>

		<desc>After having recovered the three treasures, King Graham has been crowned king. Now having needing a queen for companionship, Graham searches the land for a maiden, but to no avail, so he turns to the magic mirror for help. The mirror shows him a beautiful girl locked away in a quartz tower in a faraway land of Kolyma, and must find three keys that are used to unlock the door that will lead to her. 

King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne is a graphic adventure game. As is typical for Sierra's AGI games, players move Graham around with arrow keys and perform actions by typing commands in the interface, which are usually combination of verbs and nouns. The game is similar to its predecessor in structure and gameplay system. Like Daventry, Kolyma is a large cyclical world consisting of interconnected screens. Compared to the first game, it is bigger and busier, with more locations and places of interest. Puzzles follow a similar format; knowledge of fairy tales is advisable for solving some of them, and complex solutions grant the player more points than a brute force approach possible in some cases.</desc>

		<desc>King Graham and Queen Valanice had two children, Alexander and Rosella, and the kingdom was once peaceful. It wasn't long until Alexander was snatched from his crib and things started to take a turn for the worse. A three-headed dragon threatens the ever-peaceful Daventry, and requires a maiden to be sacrificed every year. Rosella is the chosen one.

Meanwhile, in a secluded house atop a mountain in the land of Llewdor, the evil wizard called Manannan keeps a young lad named Gwydion as his slave, forcing him to do menial tasks as he prepares his spells and observes the country through his telescope. Gwydion must find a way to outsmart the wizard, escape, and eventually discover the truth about his own identity.

King's Quest III: To Heir is Human is an adventure game similar in basic gameplay mechanics to its predecessor The player navigates Gwydion with arrow keys and interacts with the environment by typing verb and noun combination commands. Llewdor consists of interconnected screens that loop once the player character reaches the border of the land. Throughout the course of the game, Gwydion will also travel to other locations and have a magic map at his disposal, allowing him to teleport to different areas. 

There are more items to collect in this installment, and more complex actions required to execute, raising the difficulty level. A large part of the game proceeds in real time, with Mannanan following his own schedule, forcing the player to plan and time his actions. There is also a time limit imposed on the game's first major quest.</desc>

		<desc>King Graham and Queen Valanice were glad to have their children back. Graham thinks that it is time to pass onto them his old adventurers' hat. When he throws it across the room, he suffers a heart attack and collapses on the floor, and he is carried off to bed. The only way that Graham's health can be restored is by retrieving the magic fruit in the faraway land of Tamir. A beautiful fairy called Genesta offers Rosella the chance to be transported to the land, and find the fruit. But once she gets transported, she cannot be sent back unless she helps the fairy regain her talisman that was stolen by the evil witch, Lolotte. 

King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella is the first game in the series to have a female protagonist. Rosella will meet characters that will either help or hinder her. The player moves Rosella around with arrow keys, and have her perform actions by typing commands. Unlike the previous King's Quest games, which used the AGI engine, this installment uses the new SCI engine with more detailed graphics; the most visible effect is that the game is paused while the player is typing, giving unlimited time to complete even the longest commands. An AGI version of the game, however, was released as well.

Gameplay-wise, the game is similar to the first two installments of the series, with a large interconnected world open for exploration and no time limit imposed. The game is the first in the series to have a day and night cycle; certain actions can be performed only during a specific time.</desc>

		<desc>On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle. When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.

King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the "Walk" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the "Eye" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing "Look at". The "Hand" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The "Head" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.

As with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die. Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise. The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.</desc>

		<desc>For months Prince Alexander of Daventry has shut himself away from the world, thinking only of Princess Cassima, who he met while imprisoned in the previous game. Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.

Like its predecessors in the series, King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like the previous game, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verbs ("walk", "examine", "use", "talk", etc.).</desc>

		<desc>In Knight Force, the land Belloth, crossroad between five time periods, was conquered by the evil wizard Red Sabbath. And if that is not enough, he also kidnapped the princess. The player takes the role of a knight who has to set things right.

To do so, he needs to complete five levels which represent different time periods. The goal is not only to destroy the wizard clone which occupies the time period, but also to collect seven talismans which are in possession of the wizard's minions. Each collected talisman brings advantages to the hero but only work in the correct time period which may not correspond with the one it is found in. To put them to best use, the player can always pull out of a level and choose another. The challenges are platforming and melee sword-fights against various enemies. The player can perform eight combat moves.</desc>

		<desc>A city has been formed from the bones of a long-dead Orodrid creature, and you are from one of the families that controls this. Finding and hatching a Crystallion egg, which is located within the Tsirit (skull). This involves several distinct stages of gameplay. 

The Tsirit involves navigating maze-like monster-infested pathways, armed with plasma bolts and a protective suit. Within this you will encounter Bosu, a marble-based game played on a board. The Proda involves placing matching pairs of crystals in such a way that they will be charged by beams of light. 

All the while, you must play the Haresh section, to keep your family under control. This involves financial trading; getting a fair price for the goods you produce, and buying the right amounts of food, clothes and other essentials. Money must also be donated to the Tsirit.</desc>

		<desc>ast Duel: Inter Planet War 2012 follows the story of two planets that are in war with each other. On the planet Bacula, the Galden Tribe has overthrown the government and seized power over the whole world. Now they want more – by invading the peaceful planet of Mu and kidnapped Queen Sheets.

The Mu-ans decided to take action. They asked their best scientists to come up with a weapon that will defeat the Galdens. After many long months, they were able to develop a vehicle of immense firepower, capable of leaping into the air to avoid ground hazards. In addition to that, it can transform into an airborne vessel whose purpose is to eliminate any kind of enemy in the sky.

Players have to guide their vehicle through six difficult levels - alternating between ground vehicle and fighter plane – while destroying every Galden that gets in their way. While progressing, holes in the ground need to be avoided, as players lose one of their ships should they happen to fall through one. Shooting power pods scattered around the level allows the player to increase their firepower. However, they lose that firepower if one of their ships is destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>Leading Lap MPV is a three dimensional racing game with filled polygon graphics that can be played from a first person perspective or multiple third person perspectives. The game features a season mode as well as grudge matches that are multiplayer games played against a friend over a serial null modem connection.

Upon starting a new season the player first gets to choose a driver. There are five different ones and each has different statistics in terms of top speed, handling and braking. After that the player also gets to choose one of three vehicles (formula one, rally or endurance car). These differ in terms of top speed, braking and acceleration. When all choices have been made it's possible to jump straight into the first race of the championship or to practice on any of the game's race tracks. The game has a total of twelve tracks and these are played through in order. Each race is played against four AI drivers and points are awarded based on positions. To win the championship the player simply has to earn more points than the competitors.</desc>

		<desc>A squad of four tough-guy soldiers have to take out some foes in a jungle. As the game starts, four soldiers are depicted, with any who are not present to play killed immediately - a joystick adaptor is required for 3 or 4 player games.

Leatherneck resembles Ikari Warriors - waves of soldiers move down the screen shooting at you, and you must shoot them before the bullets make contact. You are armed with grenades to take out mounted turrets, or kill a wide range of enemies at once, but watch out for enemy grenades. There are extra ammunition crates and improved weapons to pick up - waggle the joystick to toggle which one you are using.

Unusually, your shots are long-range and take effect instantly. You cannot change the direction you are facing, instead having the ability to strafe.</desc>

		<desc>Something bad has happened to the race of elves. Without provocation, they attack innocent people and are preparing to conquer the peaceful city of Thyn. The Count of Thyn needs somebody to go to the city of Cyldane and ask the local Count to send reinforcements. This task is given to the protagonist of the game, who has to recruit other adventurers to help him in dangerous battles. Soon the heroes will discover a greater evil behind the sudden insanity that plagues the elves, and will have to find a way to defeat it...

Legend of Faerghail is a role-playing game with an interface similar to that of The Bard's Tale series. The player explores towns, wilderness, and complex dungeons of the game from first-person perspective, fighting enemies in turn-based combat. The combat system requires the player to pay attention to the position of the characters in battle. For example, a mage will lose concentration and fail at spellcasting if he stands too close to the enemy.</desc>

		<desc>A version of an old Norse board game called King's Table. The game has black and white teams, like chess, but each team has different pieces and a different raison d'etre.

The white team has a total of 13 pieces, the most important one being Odin the King, who starts in the centre of the 10x10 board and moves in the same way as a chess King, whereas black has 20 pawns and four other pieces. White wins if Odin can reach one of the corner squares; black wins if it surrounds Odin on all 4 sides. The pawns actually move the same way as chess queens, but pieces are captured by surrounding them on 2 sides (although some special pieces must be surrounded on 3 sides). The specials are chosen from the selection at the start of the game, and have a variety of abilities, some 'borrowed' from chess.

The presentation of this interpretation is similar to Battle Chess, with bold 3D graphics and lots of animation.</desc>

		<desc>Legend of the Lost has seven levels in total, with you controlling Jack in his attempt to rescue Jane.

The intention of Legend Of The Lost is to recreate the old B-movies of the 30s. However, thanks to some dull presentation and a batch of dull sub-games, it just doesn't hold together. Graphically, the game is unimpressive, with small sprites and basic animation, and the overall impression given is one of an 8-bit game. Very average graphics. The sprite detection seems to be a bit iffy on the first level, and the game really slows down in the fifth. A tune plays while you make you way through the game, but although it's not too bad it really starts to get on your nerves after a while.

It has all the makings of a good game, but unfortunately it doesn't manage to addict you in the slightest. Each of the game's seven levels just fail to grab your attention and the only reason you continue to play, is that it is really easy and you can tell that you will probably beat it in the first day. The cartoon strip is a nice idea, but is to slow and the humor is very poor. Unfortunately, Legend of the Lost is hardly the stuff Amigas were made for.</desc>

		<desc>The game tells of the chronicles of Anar and the mystical sword and shield whose magical aura protected the inhabitants of Anar for many centuries. Time Past these items into folklore history along with the Corsarians who supposedly guarded them. Anar has now been invaded by hordes of humanoids under the control of Suxar, and rumour tells that only with the combined force of the Sword and Shield will it be possible to defeat the invaders. You and a band of loyal men volunteer to find the enchanted artifacts and take on Suxar before time runs out.

What makes Legend any different than any other adventure then? Quite simply how the game unfolds. The way the story comes to life, as you move along the map is almost akin to reading a book, and when you are asked to make a decision, invariably the words you choose will be understood. The map can be expanded to take up the whole screen if you wish, and some of the pictograms are very realistic. There are bags of humour, and a very real need to communicate effectively with the other members of your party, although when there is fighting to be done it is left to you to get on with it.

The box contains a novelette, which does contain some clues, and a poster, but what won me over in this game is Legend Of The Sword's sheer playability. It's so user friendly, and there is even a help command which kicks in without you asking it to. Go get Legend Of The Sword right now and start having a ball.</desc>

		<desc>Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work! is (despite the number) the fourth game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. The middle-aged would-be-womanizer Larry Laffer fell off a boat during a cruise and sustained amnesia, forgetting how he and his sweetheart Patti got separated, how Larry got a job in LA, how Patti got a job with the FBI, and what happened in (the never released) Larry 4. Now Larry and Patti are working independently on two cases that are connected to each other, even though the heroes aren't aware of that. Larry's new bosses are involved in shady business, while Patti agrees to take a break from her career as a performing pianist and become an undercover agent. Will the two be together ever again?

Unlike the previous games with their text input, Larry 5 utilizes a graphical, icon-based interface. The player uses verb commands ("Look", "Talk", "Use" etc.) to interact with the environment. In a way not quite typical for Sierra's adventure games, it is impossible to "die" in Larry 5, and the amount of "dead ends" (unwinnable situations) is greatly reduced. The game is also less puzzle-oriented, allowing the player to proceed even if he/she fails to solve the required puzzle in some cases. However, the player is awarded more points for finding the "right" solution. As in the third game, both Larry and Patti are available as playable characters during different chapters of the story.</desc>

		<desc>The basic objective of the game is to guide a group of humanoid lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. In order to save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behavior of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles in order to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.

Lemmings was one of the best received video games of the early 1990s era. The popularity of the game led to development of its numerous ports to other systems and the creation of several sequels, remakes and spin-offs, as well as inspiring similar games.

		<desc>In this top-down puzzle oriented game you have to help Leonardo, a little thief, on his criminal trips. Use your joystick to lead Leonardo through 50 different levels including banks, museums, and warehouses. Pressing the fire button of your joystick you can push everything in your way, except walls. Pushed objects won't stop until colliding with other objects or the police officer and his ghost deputy whom are trying to stop your robberies. Every level has a time limit in which you must bring three equal items into one line to complete the level. Each level is larger than the screen, in the lower half of the screen you have a helpful radar for orientation. Running out of time or being caught by the police-men will cost you one of your five lives.

If you are able to master the first ten levels you will receive a password, which you can use to start your next game directly on this level. You can unlock more passwords after mastering Level 20 and 30. From Level 30 to the final Level 50 you must master the game with your 5 lives, no more passwords will be given.</desc>

		<desc>Lethal Zone is a German horizontal shooter in the same vein as the R-Type series of games. You control a spaceship and you shoot enemy ships and obstacles, while avoiding projectiles and crashing on any surface. Holding the fire button and releasing it increases the power of your shots, while hitting it repeatedly lets out a stream of them. The destroyed enemies occasionally leave behind power-ups that can be collected. They increase and modify the power of your shots. You start with 5 lives, and at each 50.000 points you receive an extra one. The games has four levels, each with a unique "boss" enemy at the end.</desc>

So the player mans a space ship, flies around the three levels (with the ability to turn around and change the flying height) and shoots everything he sees: Besides flying enemies there are also defense stations on the ground to be dealt with. But while rocket ammo is unlimited, fuel has to be regularly refilled by landing besides a fuel pod. Three smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen help in tight situations. Every level runs on a time limit.</desc>

You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings.

There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random.

The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape or disk.</desc>

The game's 8 levels feature quite a variety of settings, vehicles and situations. You will have to evade fire from snipers based in windows, enemy jets, helicopters and well-trained marines, while riding tanks and speedboats as well as being on foot. The levels are set in locations such as the enemy camp, the jungle, a ruined city and the final flight back to your base.</desc>

		<desc>Livingstone II is an excellent sequel to Livingstone I Presume, Opera Soft's classic side-scrolling 2D platformer. Adventure game fans will be glad to know that Opera Soft drops the action focus of the first game this time around, and return to the action/adventure mix.

The plot is negligible, but it does pick up where the first game left off. You play Dr. David Livingstone, legendary adventurer who was found by journalist Stanley at the end of the first game. Your job is to get out of Africa jungles alive, but before that, you must discover ancient treasure hidden in the ruins. Similar to the first game, Livingstone II allows you to change weapons in your arsenal at any time. The trusty whip and pole, which is used to vault across chasms, are back and more useful than ever. In addition to weapon slots, you also have inventory slots to store and use non-weapon objects you come across. While much of the game still requires reflexes to succeed, there is a considerable number of adventure-style puzzles to solve. In addition to hostile animals, you must deal with traps and other obstacles.

I feel that Livingstone II is easier than the first game, perhaps because most danger comes in the form of traps, which you just need good timing to avoid, rather than angry creatures that you must dispose of to save yourself. As in the first game, the maps in Livingstone II are large and intricate, full of hidden surprises and shortcuts. Overall, Livingstone II is a fun action/adventure platformer that action fans will enjoy -- and adventure game fans may be interested in as well.</desc>

		<desc>Llamatron is a fast-action arcade-style Shareware game guaranteed to have your FIRE button finger dangling off at the tendons! '90s ultraviolence in its very essence! Hours of fun for you (and a camel-friend if you like) blowing away horde after horde of alien fiends in the comfort of your own personal environment!

This game is based on an old Williams arcade game by the same dude who wrote Defender. The game - Robotron - was a big hit in the early Eighties. Llamatron takes the Robotron idea and distorts it in a Yakly fashion, adding loads of new stuff and plenty of furry beasties in the Llamasoft style.

You play the part of a totally hard laser-spitting llama. Your mission is to collect all the tiny sheep, llamas, camels and goats you see on each wave.  Standing in your way are great herds of unintelligent but numerous Grunt enemies, plus a veritable menagerie of nasty creeps which fire at you, dodge your fire, emit fire hydrants, try to ram you, murder your llamas and shoot your bottoms off with lasers. Kill them deadly.

Not everything can be killed, and some enemies take more than one shot to destroy. Your ultimate objective - destroy the Ozric Tentacle of level 99 and get to Herd Heaven on level 100.</desc>

		<desc>Locomotion is a puzzle game (some would say simulation) featuring a series of small, poorly-designed train networks. Each consists of six or seven lettered depots, and a maze of single-lane tracks linking them. As the network's signalman, your job is to make sure the dozen or so trains that make deliveries between them get to their destinations safely. No mean feat when you consider that the tracks can only support one train in any place at any one time. Clever use of loops and diversions is called for a times of trouble, and there are more than enough of them.

There are eight trains per layout, and you must make a set number of trips within a time-limit before you can progress. You'd think that wiping out a few trains at the start would make lifer easier, but time is so tight that even if you are just one train short it can prove disastrous. The game is well presented, with a clear full-screen display and all the switches for junctions clearly marked. You control the game with the mouse, and clicking the pointer on switches moves the junction sections between their two positions, so there's no clumsy controls to get used to.

Sound is used sparingly, but effectively, with a train whistle to warn you which one is about to begin its journey.

Despite such a simple premise, Locomotion is a very tough game to play, and requires the sort of intense concentration that makes the veins stick out of your forehead. Simple stuff, but fairly entertaining nevertheless.</desc>

		<desc>The Age of the Great Guilds has arrived. Communities and states comprised of people united by a common trade were created. The Guild of Weavers has achieved such mastery in their trade that they discovered the secret of weaving the very fabric of reality. They were treated with suspicion by other guilds, who eventually accused them of practicing witchcraft and banned them to a secluded island, which they called Loom.

Bobbin Threadbare is a young man from the Guild of Weavers. He is outcast from the guild and blamed for the lack of prosperity in recent times, though he does not know why. On his seventeenth birthday he is summoned by the Elders of the guild, who intend to decide his fate. However, shortly thereafter all the inhabitants of the village except Bobbin are turned into swans. Bobbin finds out that he is the child of the Great Loom, found by Lady Cygna, who tried to use the loom's powers to save the guild. Bobbin's stepmother Dame Hetchel teaches him the art of weaving magical drafts, and Bobbin embarks on a journey to find the lost flock, and the answers to his questions.

Loom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called "drafts" in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called "distaff". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.</desc>

		<desc>In the desert town Vertic, werewolves, vampires, mummies and zombies appear suddenly, feasting on the population until only a ghost town of undead is left. Two ordinary citizens team up with two professional monster hunters to cleanse the town of evil. Sharon, Charlie, Susan Leicester and Abraham Van Halen must fight their way through monsters and eventually defeat the overlord of each species, ending the invasion. 

Lords of Doom is a hybrid game that incorporates elements of adventure and role-playing. The player controls the party of characters from a first-person view, navigating a pseudo-3D town. The adventure gameplay manifests itself in exploration of individual locations, interaction with objects, and the use of items to solve puzzles. Role-playing elements are present in party management and character statistics. Each character has, beside hitpoints, thirst and hunger meters, so that the player has to "feed" the characters regularly in order for them to stay alive. Combat is done in real time.</desc>

		<desc>1990 saw the release of Lords of War on the Amiga systems, a Breakout clone game with interesting idea, created and distributed by Digital Concepts.

On every screen, there is a castle defended by a movable shield. The shield can be moved horizontally and vertically (always along the castle wall). The goal is to bring down the walls of one of the other castles within a given time limit. If no one does this in time, the game automatically switches to "fast speed" until the first slot is shattered.

The well animated graphic looks decent, changes from level to level and the scrolling is nice. The sound effects are according to the atmosphere, beautifully creepy - timely. You can not complain about the joystick control either. What else is there? Menu with numerous options (faster, slower, etc.), pause function, highscore list. The gameplay is not exactly the latest, but the original presentation and the built-in gags, The Lords of War lift something of the usual breakout monotony from. After all...</desc>

It's now your responsibility to lead the remaining survivors to the nearest U.S. base, evading or facing an elusive and dangerous enemy on his own grounds.




Most of the time, you'll see a map of the country on the screen and navigate your men through the country. It's important to watch your men's health and morale by getting them food, water, ammo and letting them rest, etc. When reaching certain spots on the map, e.g. a native village, the game presents the current situation in a nice graphic scene. Sometimes you'll run into V.C. snipers, patrols, whole ambushes or encounter minefields. Then the game offers some small arcade sequences like firing your guns or fighting it out in desperate hand-to-hand combat. The progress of your party is accompanied by video sequences from the Vietnam War.</desc>

		<desc>Lothar Matthäus is a solid soccer simulation from Audiogenic, published by OCEAN. Despite bearing the name of one of Germany's best players, the game's scope is not as large as the likes of Champion Manager; instead, the game focuses on tactics and action-oriented gameplay where you can control each player directly. The game strikes a good balance between action and tactics, although neither element is as good as the best of each camp. Choose to lead your favorite club from five European countries (England, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany) in a friendly match, league, or cup play. Overall, Lothar Matthäus is a decent beer-and-pretzel soccer simulation/action game that doesn't take itself too seriously. Good as a quick fix, but lacking in long-term play value to warrant repeated play.</desc>

		<desc>The second Lotus game shifts focus to an arcade-oriented gameplay. Being the first of the series released for a game console (for Sega Mega Drive under the title Lotus Turbo Challenge), the fuel limit and difficulty levels are dropped, and the lap-based levels are replaced with course-based time trials, (not unlike arcade games such as Out Run), with the player required to complete each course within a specified time to qualify for the next one.

> [Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge](/amiga/lotus-esprit-turbo-challenge) was widely acclaimed as the best driving game of 1990. The best just got better with the release of ***Lotus Turbo Challenge 2***.
> 
> * Synchronised play for up to four drivers with computer link.
> * One player full screen imagery.
> * Hair raising new hazards - rain, lightning, fog, snow, commuter traffic, tunnels, bridges and level crossings.
> * A chance to race across the USA.
> * A choice of the sleek new Turbo Esprit or the new stylish Elan softtop.
> * 8 death defying stages with over 60 Check Points.

> -- Back of game box

In addition to the Esprit Turbo SE, Lotus Turbo Challenge 2 also features the Lotus Elan SE, hence 'Esprit' being dropped from the title. There is no choice of car however; it varies depending on the scenery of the level (the hard-top Esprit is used for the snow and thunderstorm levels, for example, while the Elan SE appears in the desert and forest levels).

In an improvement over its predecessor, Lotus 2's single-player mode uses all of the game screen instead of half, and opponent cars appear in a variety of colors (opponent cars in the original game were all white). However, music is absent from racing altogether; the player instead hears the car's engine sound. Lotus 2 uses a password system to access different races (once the player qualifies for a particular race, the password is revealed); the password DUX accesses a hidden game, and the password TURPENTINE removes the race time limits.

Barry Leitch's intro music for Lotus 2 is often found on playlists of retro computer music webradio stations; it contains a sampled voice at around the 12-second mark (played through the left channel only) which says "you will not copy this game". The sample is played very quietly during the first few bars, and can be easily accessed in any MOD tracker program.

***Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge*** was the first game in the series was 
released in 1990 for most popular contemporary 8-bit and 16-bit computer 
systems, the Amiga version being the most technically advanced. The game 
allowed the player to race a Lotus Esprit Turbo SE car through several 
(32 in the Amiga version) circuit race tracks of varying scenery.  
Two player simultaneous play (with split screen) was also provided, 
and a choice of audio tracks to accompany races.
















Each track is lap-based and consists of turns of varying degrees, as 
well as hills and hollows which slow down or speed up the car passing 
through them. Each turn is indicated by a chain of road-side signs, 
and the difficulty of the turn is reflected by the number and density 
of these signs - a feature common to all titles in the Lotus series.
















While racing, the players must manage their fuel supply, occasionally 
visiting the pit stop for refuelling. Also apart from overtaking the 
other cars, the racers must avoid various hazards and obstacles. These 
are dependent on the scenery the track is located in, and include 
slippery road on the winter courses, road blocks, slippery puddles and 
wooden logs.
















The tracks are split into three race series, with different difficulty levels. In each race the player or players compete against 20 opponents. The goal is to finish each race on the highest possible position; if the player finishes a race within the first 10 places they qualify for the next race and receive points towards a final position on the high-score table. The names of the computer-controlled drivers are puns on the names of real-life racers of the time ("Ayrton Sendup", "Nijel Mainsail" and "Alain Phosphate" for example).
















Unusually, the player's starting position in each race is the exact opposite of the position reached at the end of the previous one. This gives weaker players a chance to improve by starting in a higher position.
















When racing in the one-player mode, the bottom half of the screen is unused and features a static image of the Esprit Turbo. In the two-player mode one half is used by each player. The two-player feature operates similarly to the one-player mode, except that only one player needs to reach 10th place to qualify both players for the next race.

		<desc>Lupo Alberto is the export from Italy. He's a cartoon character - a wolf in fact - who, in the eyes of the manual, 'is friendly, sharp and at the same time shy.'

The quality of Lupo's life to which he pays attention is a hen called Marta. She wants to be alone, with Lupo, so he can put his gift of artistic sensitivity into action. But the course of true love never runs smooth, even for anthropomorphic wildlife. There's a social and environmental problem to be addressed - like finding somewhere with some privacy so the two chums can get even friendlier. Lupo is a shy guy after all.

Lupo's mission turns out to be a cut down Super Mario Bros of sorts. A scrolling, platform-based landscape is patrolled by creatures with differing intelligence and movement patterns, the death of some resulting in the appearance of special features for Lupo to catch. Lupo is a little sluggish to control, it must be said, but he is very maneuverable, being capable of jumping at different heights and moving in the air.

Better still, you can grab a friend for some two-player action. Yes, the two animal lovers can go in search of peace together - simultaneously on screen as it happens. 

Lupo Alberto made me laugh and laugh. And when I'd stopped laughing I laughed some more. That's not to say that Lupo's not without room for improvement. Its addictive nature makes the lengthy disk accessing to load a level all the more annoying. Some secret rooms and other forms of hidden bonuses would have iced the cake too.

In stark contrast to all the deadly serious simulations currently doing the rounds on the Amiga, Lupo Alberto is fun. And funny. Now there are two sound reasons to download it.</desc>

		<desc>M.U.D.S. (Mean Ugly Dirty Sports) is a slightly humorous but definitely violent game in which the game itself is won by scoring at least 7 out of 14 goals or by killing enough of the opposing team. Tackles, pummelings, being thrown into the moat -where a shark-like thing will eat you if you don't get out on time- are just some of the things that can happen to your team.

Of course, there are more ways to win: bribing the opposing team, the referee, or the creature which is used as the ball are worth considering.

Should your team need a little extra morale, just pick a fight, or buy and sell players on the slave market whenever you like.

M.U.D.S. vaguely resembles Speedball in the sense that you try to throw the ball in the opponent's goal, but that's where the resemblance ends for me.</desc>

		<desc>M1 Tank Platoon is a very encompassing game that allowed players to issue orders to Tanks, AA units, Aircraft, Artillery and Infantry in a campaign against Warsaw Pact units in Europe, while specifically controlling a platoon of 4 M1 tanks. The player could jump into the position of the driver, gunner or commander of any of the tanks to view the world from a 1st person perspective, or work from a tactical map to command all his forces.</desc>

		<desc>Professor Mariarti is, as the game title suggests, a mad scientist. Not all of his experiments worked out the way they should and now he needs to shut down the power in five of his labs (the first four can be tackled in any order). This plays out as a standard platformer: Mariarti jumps over gaps between platforms and dodges enemies (he can take a few hits before dying) until he reaches the end of the level, i.e. the off switch.

At the start of the game he only throw wrenches to defend himself, but during the game he finds coins scattered around the labs. Those can be used to buy more advanced weapons like a laser cannon. However, killed enemies respawn after a short time. To proceed he also needs to solve a few puzzles by collecting items and bringing them to the correct place. There are also a number of switch puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>This is a budget game and budget games have a preordained right to have an element of tackiness, right? Wrong. Since the dawn of time it seems that only one out of every fifteen new budget titles were good, and it looks like staying that way on the Amiga.

Set in Egypt you play the part of the cat goddess Mafdet who is trying to recover the Book of the Dead which has been stolen by the evil god Seth and unless it is recovered no Egyptian will be able to enter the afterlife.

Being a god Mafdet can transform into a cat as well as her normal human form. In cat mode Mafdet can run, jump and pick up objects - not too much use against the minions of Seth, but at least they don't notice you. As a woman you can swing a fairly brutal sword.

The general playing area is large, and I found myself noticing a new exit from the screens just as I thought I was stuck. Some exits are too low to allow the woman to pass through until you run into them with the cat. Other times a hole in the floor is the best way through.

The graphics are really large, though the animation and definition fail to make any lasting impact. As well as not being exactly too pretty to look at the main character is also impossible to control accurately. Mafdet is depressing to play, it's not that cheap and it most definitely isn't cheerful.</desc>

		<desc>Magic Johnson's Basketball is a decent arcade-style basketball game starring LA Lakers' superstar Magic Johnson, one of the most famous players of all time. It is a direct translation of the popular coin-op arcade game called Magic Johnson's Fastbreak Basketball. Like the arcade original, the game is easy enough for beginners to learn, and challenging enough for experts. You can play against the computer or another human opponent in a hot-seat mode.

As an arcade-oriented game, Magic Johnson's Basketball is pretty good. You can shoot 3-pointers, perform slam dunks, and of course Magic Johnson's famous fast break with a slam dunk finish. The game includes a good training sequence, demo mode, and smooth animation.

When compared with other basketball games made during the same period, Magic Johnson's Basketball falls flat with many limitations. You can only play a single game, unlike the entire season that Ed Ringler's Omni-Play Basketball (also a Magic Johnson-promoted game) simulates. And the on-court action is far from the fun of EA's 1988 classic One on One: Jordan vs. Bird. Without the competition, Magic Johnson's Basketball would have been considered a great game. But basketball fans simply have many better choices to choose from than this game.</desc>

The game is a side-scrolling shooter that plays out across four worlds inhabited by a variety of enemies. Players can cause more damage to these enemies by charging their shots before firing. The player's weapon also changes its shape and features according to the requirements of each world.

Bitmap Kid has special athletic abilities. He can jump high by stepping on whirlwinds and can even destroy all the creatures he hits after falling down from a high place. In addition, players can drive a bike, dive, and even fly through the use of special items.</desc>

		<desc>In Major Motion, The Draconian League have taken over the roads and made them dangerous for ordinary road users. You are in control of a car, driving up a vertically scrolling road with occasional forks in it, making the game similar to Spy Hunter. 

The car is mounted with guns, and so are many enemy cars, but cars can be rammed off the road as well as shot. Watch out for other enemy vehicles such as helicopters though; be sure to avoid their bullets.

You can drive into the back of open lorries to gain upgraded weapons. Weapons are activated via keyboard presses, which makes the game more difficult than it would otherwise be. Sound and music sampled from suitably action-packed films aims to add to the atmosphere.</desc>

		<desc>Krisalis’ fourth licensed Manchester United game – the title refers to their success in winning both the Premier League and the FA Cup in the same (93-94) season –- something only six clubs have achieved.

The gameplay is overhead view, and has much in common with Kick Off, offering loose control, a range of moves, and an emphasis on short passing. It’s not easy at first, but persistence reaps rewards, especially with a two-button controller.

Making life easier is the Tacti-Grid tactics editor, which allowed you to customise tactics by instructing players on exactly where they go when the ball is in a particular position. The editor is the most comprehensive ever seen in an action football game, allowing you to rename players, change their appearance and skills, transfer them across clubs, move clubs around the divisions, change their kits, and more.</desc>

		<desc>After Manchester United won the English League championship for the first time since 1967, it was no surprise that Krisalis re-used their existing license for a third licensed football game. Little did they know that the club was entering an unprecedented run of success that has continued well into the 2010s.

The basic control system will be familiar to anyone who’s played a Kick Off game, as it involves holding fire to trap the ball under your player’s foot, and releasing fire to pass, although the ball will be kicked onwards if it is moving fast when it comes to you. Other gameplay features include diving headers, variable pitch conditions, penalty shoot-outs and accurate deflections. 2500 players featured in the game all had a range of varied ability statistics, as well as different skin tones.

As well as individual matches and custom-created tournaments (which have much the same range of features as Sensible Soccer, plus full calculation of injury and suspension severities, including disciplinary points and differing injury lengths), you can play out a full season of matches for any club in England’s top 5 divisions – all domestic league and cup matches are included, with promotions and relegations taking place after each season. The Tacti-Grid editor allows for advanced match tactics to be configured and experimented with.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2004 we're going to be invaded by eyeball-like aliens called Orbs, who pollute the environment, experiment on humans and hire manhunters. The Manhunters are human employees of the Orbs who have the job of tracking down, capturing and handing over people conducting anti-Orb activities.

The game action is broken up in four ways. First, there are close up views of your immediate area which allow you to interact with the objects and characters around you. Next is the transport screen, which is basically a map of 'Cisco showing all the locations you can visit. Third are the arcade sequences which include shoot 'em ups, and a maze-like game similar to that found in the hospital section of It Came From The Desert. Finally there are animated sequences which help break up the action and add to the atmosphere of the game.

There are no text commands; everything is entered via the mouse and the return key, so you don't have to worry about ambiguous transatlantic gibberish.

The graphics are technically poor and clumsy, but some of the animated sequences are superb. The accompanying soundtrack, however, is totally inadequate and spoils the effect. Overall, Manhunter: San Francisco is an exciting sequel. Don't expect a Leisure Suit Larry clone, it's nothing like it, rather Manhunter has a style all its own.</desc>

		<desc>The Edison mansion has always been a creepy old house on the edge of town. There have been rumors of strange experiments going on and of odd creatures living amongst the Edison family. There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.

Players start by choosing two students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.</desc>

		<desc>Maniax is a Qix variant. The basic playing principle: the player controls a dot which can draw lines on the screen and when a closed figure is drawn, the colour of the area changes. Additionally there are enemies, either confined to the uncoloured or coloured areas, which cause the player sprite to die if touched. The goal is to colour 75% of the screen.

This variant reveals background images taken from 16 cities instead of just changing the screen colour. There are also various extras to pick up which give advantages like extra lives, frozen enemies or extra points. Triangles show negative effects when picked up, e.g. instant death or deceleration.</desc>

The gameplay is very similar to Ancos older game Strip Poker II+. In the game itself you can raise bets and can trade each cloth part for 100 credits if you are running out of cash and your hand is too good to not raise. There are two different difficulty levels, "Easy" and "Hard". The AI does sometimes bluffing with aggressive bets.</desc>

		<desc>1996 saw the release of Master Blaster on the Amiga systems, a Bomberman clone, created by Alpha Brothers and distributed by Nexus as a Shareware. Master Blaster v2.21 was later made freeware and is available for download on Aminet.

This game is based on the idea of Bomberman. You can play with up to 5 enemies at the same time. The main goal is to survive and kill all the other enemies. You can do this by placing bombs on the ground. They will destroy the brick walls around you and may even release some extras to collect.

Very good Bomberman/DynaBlaster clone that only focus is on the VS Battle aspect of the game. It remains one of the best multiplayer PD games ever!</desc>

		<desc>Masterblazer is both a remake of and a follow-up to the Lucasfilm Games game Ballblazer.

Ballblazer is a futuristic sport played in vehicles called "Rotofoils". The play field is a large rectangle made out of squares. The object of the game is to get a ball called "Plasmorb" into the goal, which moves along the edge of the play field. Otherwise, the rules are simple: "Three minutes, two players, one victor!" The game is played in first-person on a split screen and can be played by either one or two players.

Compared to Ballblazer, Masterblazer offers two new playing options: a Tournament Mode and a Rotofoil Race.</desc>

All cars are equipped with weapons which can be used to destroy the opposition. Other things to keep in mind are holes on the track which need to be jumped over and power ups which offer advantages when picked up, e.g. more speed. Permission to start at the next race is only given if the player finishes the race among the first three. Between races the car and its weapon system can be upgraded.</desc>

		<desc>Car racing games have always been a favourite on the Amiga, especially top-down racers where you can take on your mates. MAX Rally hopes to build on the playability and graphic appeal of previous classics such as Skidmarks and Micro Machines and bring the whole genre up to date.

As well as being able to play against up to four human players, various other racing modes are available, including racing against computer cars, racing against the clock or participating in a Championship or Max Challenge. There are twenty different tracks and four different types of terrain (Woodland, Cosmic, Alpine and Dunes) to be negotiated.

Link up games are also possible, so you can play two player split-screen, two player link up or four player split-screen link up. If you don't have two Amigas to stick together you can play in a battle mode where the slowest cars are eliminated as they fall off the screen.

MAX Rally fails to inspire. It's fun for a little while, in a sub-Skidmarks sort of way, but the computer opponents are too easy and the multiplayer mode isn't imaginative enough to retain interest for long. It's like the original Micro Machines, only half a decade late. Five years ago, maybe.</desc>

		<desc>Mega Motion is a puzzle game where the player has to move a number of balls across the screen towards an exit. The balls are linked together with one acting as an anchor the others are constantly rotating around. The game is played with the mouse. By clicking on one of the balls it becomes the anchor that the others rotate around. Clicking with the right mouse button changes the direction of the rotation.

Each level has obstacles that block the balls' path and objects that can be collected. Most common are blocks that are destroyed after being hit by a ball a couple of times but there are also those obstacles that destroy the ball that hits them. There are also bombs, which set off chain reactions when hit, and switcher blocks that reveal hidden doors or open up new passages. When all balls but one have been destroyed a life is lost and the level has to be restarted. Each level also has a time limit. Overstepping it is allowed but the player will then get a lower score.

The game has a total of 100 levels that are divided into four categories: easy, average, difficult and very difficult. For every level completed the player is given a password.</desc>

		<desc>You start your mission with a lone starfighter with some very puny lasers. At this stage it's still got a very handy set of lasers with which you can take out just about anything moving, but you'll have to set your joystick to auto-fire. While Mega Typhoon is a typical vertical shoot-em-up, you can move a little to the left and right while picking up some useful extra laser power ups, missiles, homing missiles, side-shots and extra lives.

You can also press the space bar which activates a smart bomb weapon that effectively wipes out any opposing enemy ships in the vicinity. Once you've got to grips with what's going on, it's on to the next world.

The game is fast, and the action is as frenetic as anything you've seen on the Amiga in a long while... but the in-game graphics are pretty basic and colourless. The sound is sadly lacking with only a few effects for explosions and lasers and a racey-but-unobtrusive soundtrack at the beginning.

Mega Typhoon is a playable game, it's just that I've seen the Amiga do better with Hybris, Battle Squadron, Swiv or Xenon 2. It is an average game that hasn't really much to offer the already saturated shoot-em-up genre. Which is a shame because we all know that the Amiga can do so much better than this.</desc>

Again the non-linear nature of this series is taken further in the vast number of ways you can stop the tyrant. Exploration of the game's large number of planets and moons will reveal clues of the many different routes you can take to achieve this goal. Run for president, become a property tycoon - or a violent 'eco' terrorist. The 'go anywhere, do anything' motto is still in full effect in this first-person perspective hybrid game.</desc>

You run through each of the 8 levels, which primarily scroll horizontally, shooting everyone before they can shoot you. At times you will have to shoot trees and other scenery to progress. 

Finding strategic placings is important, especially as you can't shoot while on water. Most of the time you are on foot, but at times you can hijack vehicles of shot foes. There are improved weapons, smart bombs and energy recharges to collect. Each of the 8 levels ends with a large vehicle requiring multiple shots to destroy.</desc>

Your objective is to drive around Miami, looking for red cars and shooting them away, within a time limit for each level. Avoid hitting buildings or other cars, and don't shoot too many civilian cars or you are history. If you drive erratically in the vicinity of other cop cars they will stop you, costing valuable time.

		<desc>You know that castle thingy that you see on the titles of The Wonderful World of Disney, the one that looks all peaceful an' everythin'? Well, all is not as it seems. Inside the tower Mickey is fighting for peace, justice and the American way.

Merlin the magician has had his magic wand stolen by the evil Ogre King. The wand has been split into four pieces and given to witches at the top of the towers in the castle. The ogre has put ghosties and ghoulies and things in the towers to try and stop you from getting the wand back together, but you are armed with a squirt gun and a hammer to deal with them. Eventually you just seal up the doors and stop them from emerging. This is done by entering a series of sub-games: The Puddle Maze, The bubble Machine, The Pump Room and The Dripping Taps. At the top of each tower is a guardian thingie that must be shot in the head to retrieve a piece of the wand.

In my experience, cartoon character licences very rarely make good computer games, but I'm glad to say that the most famous of them all has managed to keep his reputation by spawning a cracker of a game. The graphics are nicely detailed and coloured, the ghostly music is more funny than spooky, creating exactly the right atmosphere to suit the already amusing gameplay - smacking teddy bears over the head is great fun.</desc>

***Midnight Resistance*** (ミッドナイトレジスタンス Middonaito Rejisutansu?) is a 
side-scrolling action shooting game produced by Data East for the 
arcades in 1989. The game was ported by Data East to the Sega Mega Drive 
in 1990 and by Ocean Software to various home computer platforms during 
the same year. The game is set in a dystopian future where the player 
controls a member of a resistance movement who goes on a mission to 
rescue his kidnapped family from a mad scientist.




***Ocean Software*** released ports for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, 
Amstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga, and the Atari ST, some which were 
developed by Special FX. The Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions 
are of particular note and are regularly mentioned in lists of greatest
games ever made for these systems.




The Spectrum version had a completely redesigned, chunky, cartoony 
style to it. It had push screen scrolling and very few on-screen 
colours due to hardware limitations, but it is considered by many 
to be one of the stand out technical achievements for the hardware 
and was awarded a score of 90% in Sinclair User and 93% in CRASH 
magazine. It was also included in their 100 best Spectrum games 
ever made, reaching number 10. The Spectrum version was also voted 
number 11 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time.
The Commodore version stayed relatively faithful to the original 
arcade version. It was critically acclaimed by most publications 
of the time and gained a score of 90% from Zzap!64 Magazine. 
It was also featured in their top 100 C64 games ever made. 
The ZX Spectrum version was ported to the Amstrad CPC in a stripped 
down version as was common for the era, due to the two computers 
sharing the same processor. It is missing the music and colour of 
the 128 Spectrum version and has less buyable weapons at the end of 
each stage. It achieved a review of 86% in Amstrad Action magazine.

		<desc>This chapter continues the story of the people of the Isle of Midwinter. Now, they have left their homeland and joined forces with the people of Agora, forming the Atlantic Federation. Their arch enemies, the Saharan Empire, control each of the 42 Atlantic Islands except Agora.

As a special agent of the federation you must complete top secret missions designed to initiate rebellion among the Saharan people. I am glad to say that this game is much better than the excellent original. The game boasts a staggering 1,000,000 square miles of terrain for you to explore, utilising 22 different modes of transportation with which to get around. This game has such depth that you will be lost in it for hours, if not days once you get involved.</desc>

		<desc>Midwinter is set in a post-apocalyptic world, as the Earth entered a nuclear winter caused by the fall of a meteorite. The titular island has been formed in the Azores group of islands, caused by volcanic activity.

The player initially controls Captain John Stark, the commander of local militia known as Free Villages Police Force (FVPF), who attempt to protect their home from the invasion of armed troops under the command of General Masters. As Stark, the player has to recruit civilians and members of FVPF in order to join forces and prevent Masters from reaching the base located in the south-eastern part of the island.

Midwinter is a hybrid game that combines elements of strategy and action. The player selects and controls the 32 recruits as they attempt to protect the island within a limited amount of time. Two hours of game time are assigned to each recruit; afterwards, the strategy battle moves to the next turn. During their turns, the recruits fight enemy forces in action-oriented combat reminiscent of a first-person shooter. Specific and detailed injuries add a tactical edge to these battles. Enemy units are mostly composed of armed snow buggies, as well as supply vehicles. Eliminating a large amount of them or killing the commander of the unit usually successfully completes the mission.

Terrain plays an important role in the game, as many snow-covered mountain areas are impassable, and the player must plan ahead how to advance. The player can use snow buggies, ski, and cable cars to access the goal.

When recruiting characters, the player has to pay attention to their personal relationships. For example, Stark can recruit his girlfriend, but another character will refuse to join because he is in love with her and jealous of the Captain.</desc>

		<desc>The closest comparison to this action game would be Afterburner, a game which was overdue a decent home computer re-creation. You view the game slightly behind your plane, which must shoot out enemy planes, tanks and installations while avoiding their fire. You are armed with different kinds of weapons including downward bombs, air-to-air missiles and a nuclear bomb. More of each of these can be picked up by collecting the parachutes which are dropped into your path. There are mountain ranges, deserts and arctic scenes to clear along the way, with big boss planes to face.</desc>

You are armed with cannons, rockets and Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground missiles. Aerodynamics, blackouts and physics are all recreated. There are six missions to take on, starting with your basic training. 

After this, there are four diverse missions with colour-coded identification, and a final extra-tough mission you can only do once you have successfully completed the others. The missions involve arctic reconnaissance, dogfighting over the Great Wall of China, an oil refinery, and destroying terrorist infrastructure. Your final task involves destroying a nuclear plant in the desert. Missions have primary and secondary objectives affecting scoring.</desc>

As opposed to its predecessor, Super Fulcrum takes place in one big scenario instead of single missions. Your task is to represent the Soviet Union in a UN force sent to South America to defend a small country that is being threatened by a bigger and stronger neighbour. The game is relatively open-ended, allowing you to fulfill your missions in the way you see fit instead of monitoring your every step. All missions and their results are handled in your pilot's log.</desc>

		<desc>The space traveler and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world VARN, where he was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a party of local adventurers helping him. The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun. 

Gates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.

Like in the previous game, character classes rely each on a particular attribute to be effective. Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return, with the addition of two new classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection features humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A new feature is the possibility to hire two non-player characters to travel with the party and participate in battles. A new skill system is introduced as well, allowing characters to learn such abilities as mountaineering (necessary to traverse mountains), linguist (for reading certain messages), cartographer (for creating an auto-map), and others.

Compared to the first game, the sequel is more quest-oriented, with various characters in towns giving quests to the party, as opposed to purely exploration-based traveling in the predecessor. Time also plays a large role in this game, with some instances requiring the party to travel to different time periods. Characters also age as the game goes on; If the player waits too long, the characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging, and they will eventually die.</desc>

		<desc>A party of brave heroes managed to defeat the corrupted guardian Sheltem as he attempted to destroy the world of CRON. However, the great battle between the guardians Corak and Sheltem continued in another place - the world of Terra, where Sheltem was originally appointed as a guardian. Revolting against the powerful race of the Ancients, Sheltem takes possession of their space-traveling nacelles, hurling them at the suns of other planets. It is now up to a group of local adventurers to help Corak and vanquish Sheltem once and for all.

Isles of Terra is the third installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Gates to Another World. Like its predecessors, it is a role-playing game focusing on first-person exploration of vast pseudo-3D environments, character building, and turn-based combat. The five selectable races remain the same as in the previous games, as well as the eight character classes with the addition of two new ones: Druid and Ranger. Like in the second game, characters may learn unique skills such as thievery, swimming, merchant, and others.

This installment does away with random or pre-set enemy encounters, featuring instead enemies dynamically roaming the game world, allowing to initiate combat from a distance (for example with ranged attacks or spells). There is no option to bribe or surrender to enemies, and escaping combat can be accomplished simply by moving away, unless the enemies have already locked on the party. An automap feature is available at all times, and the player is also allowed to save the game at any time.</desc>

		<desc>As you can guess from the title, Mikro Mortal Tennis is basically founded on tennis game, but its goal is to eliminate your opponents, not simply to defeat them! To this purpose, players might make use of loads of Mortal-Kombat and Street-Fighter-like special moves, in addition to many others, directly taken from lots of famous videogames or films. Besides, there are bombs, Fire'n'forget rockets, heat-seeking missiles at their complete disposal... The game boasts an amusing animated intro which will explain the reason of such a strange tournamnet - by the way, your order is to climb a high mountain, just like the second episode of the Mortal Kombat saga; moreover, it features several victory and defeat pictures and an even more crazy final sequence than the intro!

Players can choose their characters from a range of twelve different guys, each distinguished with typical characteristics, which can be edited in the proper menu. Beyond every human conceiving, the game is spangled with lots of mad things, like referee-slaughtering, animals which will appear in the field, VIPs which will perform during the match, and a mysterious tapir named Fart (main character of the game, as you can be able to guess from the introduction) which will perform in a number of funny anims. At the beginning of the match the players will enter the field and choose the field in which play with an incredible money trowing!

Of course, the sporting side of the game is not to be underestimated. You'll always have to win your match! From this point of view, the game is classically structured: pitch type, number of sets to win, type of game (single, double or training), as well as the type of tournament to join; you'll be able to select, in addition to the above-mentioned MK-style tournament, an UNFRIENDLY tournament in which up to eight human players are allowed to take part, or a full season, where player will have to win as much as possible to travel all over the world, and in order to buy weapons and points which will help him in his short career. It's possible to save and subsequently restore your season from disc as well as every change made in the players editing menu, where you're able to change the name, the characteristics and the shirt colour of all the characters... Well, that's all, there's nothing left but wishing you to enjoy Mikro Mortal Tennis! Mikro Mortal Tennis supports all Amiga models with at least 1 Meg of Ram.</desc>

		<desc>The computer game of an Anna Popkess book (which was originally bundled with the game) uses an interactive fiction System Without A Name, or SWAN for short. It’s set in a post-apocalyptic world of guards desperately attempting to retain order over mobs of genetically-mutated thugs, with extensive use of the death penalty. 

Into this maelstrom steps Robin, an 11-year-old psychic beamed forward in time from before the drama. Adjusting to a completely different form of life, Robin must learn to survive and get adequate food, and ultimately infiltrate this vicious police state.

Encounters with other characters are frequent, of whom some retain a semblance of old humanity. Daryl, Alison and Matthew all come in handy, and must be coaxed into doing what you wish. Examining objects often gives few clues, so the detail in the manual is vital, although few of the objects are vastly different from familiar 20th century artifacts. Two levels of object descriptions exist, allowing for faster or more immersive play.</desc>

		<desc>Minskies Furballs is not a port, but a spiritual clone of Puyo Puyo. In a tournament against a cast of crazy characters, you must guide and rotating falling pairs of cats of different colours to make up colour combinations. When four or more cats make contact, they are eliminated, and those above fall down, thereby possibly triggering a chain reaction. Chain reactions will make fish and boulders fall down into your opponent's playfield, blocking his progress. Eliminating blocks will sometimes give you special weapons which can be used to eliminate cats and blocks from the screen.

The game can be played in a two-player mode or against crazy cartoon opponents such as the ugly pie Boo Cake, Hawkings the hawk or the slimy Greebo, who express their mood using both samples and small animations. If you win money in the match, you can gamble in a fruit machine. In two-player mode, each player can have a handicap.</desc>

Reaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you can’t move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of – he must be located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman. In some cases furniture can be used to your advantage. The whole game is similar to Impossible Mission, requiring lots of logic, puzzle-solving and structured thought.</desc>

		<desc>Khantun is traditionally a peaceful land, with no army or wars. Former leader Kaimen has turned to using his powers for evil, and the land has not withstood his aggression. The Holy Ones have been kidnapped, the land instead ruled by an evil group of monks. It is down to the player to vanquish Kaimen and restore the path of righteousness.

The game combines top-viewed role playing elements with combat action. The player explores the lands, but when encountering unfriendly people the player must fight, using swords or martial arts moves, as well as long-range missiles and magical powers.</desc>

		<desc>Guybrush Threepwood, the mighty pirate who can hold his breath for ten minutes, could have lived quietly and happily with his sweetheart Elaine, the governor of Melee Island. But the restless pirate spirit won't let Guybrush in peace. Things don't go very well with Elaine, and Guybrush (now with a beard) embarks on a new adventure: searching for the legendary treasure of Big Whoop. However, the evil ghost pirate LeChuck hasn't left the stage yet. His subordinates are trying to bring him back from the dead one more time. Will Guybrush be able to defeat his archenemy again?

Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge is a classic, puzzle-solving adventure game and a sequel to The Secret of Monkey Island. It utilizes the same command-based SCUMM interface (the player uses verb commands on highlighted objects) and branching dialogue system (choosing between several different responses during conversations) that were used in its predecessor. The game features hand-painted graphics, and is the first to utilize LucasArts' iMUSE system, which synchronizes music with visual action on the screen by providing smooth transition between themes.

The events of the game take place on a new set of islands; a part of the game allows the player to explore several islands simultaneously. Uncommonly for adventure games, LeChuck's Revenge features two difficulty levels. The easier one is dubbed Monkey Island 2 Lite; it bypasses or simplifies some of the harder puzzles.</desc>

Bob owns a zoo, but the creatures (monkeys, snakes and all the rest) have gone on the rampage and must be stopped. Its levels contain ledges, ramps, and similar, and scroll vertically. Bob must aim his short range gun at them for long enough to cause them to explode, then release to send them up the screen, and ideally hit them again, to release as many bonus fruits as possible. This must all be done within a time limit – complete it before being told to hurry up and you get a time bonus.</desc>

		<desc>Moonstone's gameplay blends several different genres, including strategy, real time fighting and role-playing video games. It allows up to four players to participate in a basic turn based Role Playing Game with real time combat for any encounters. It is also notable as one of the goriest games of its time, with some exceptionally bloody fight and death scenes.

The player takes on the role of a chosen knight who is sent by the druids to return the mystical 'moonstone' to Stonehenge. The game supports between 1 to 4 players at once, with the computer controlling any knights not controlled by human players as rival NPCs.
The world map is divided into 4 distinct regions:

(1) Misty Moors: The NW region of the Blue Knight (Sir Godber). Monsters found there are the Axe and Spear-bearing Troggs as well as their War Beasts. There is also the city of Highwood with the High Temple where the player can buy and sell magical items.

(2) Wetlands: The SE region of the Red Knight (Sir Edward). Monsters are the Trolls and the Mudmen. There is also the city of Waterdeep with Mythral the Mystic who can advance the player's abilities in exchange of gold (or randomly reduce them).

(3) Great Forest: The SW region of the Green Knight (Sir Jeffrey). Monsters are the Troggs and the Ratmen. It features the Stonehenge where the player can gain a life by donating a magical item.

(4) Northern Wastelands: The NE region of the Orange Knight (Sir Richard). Monsters include Troggs and Baloks. It also features the Tower of Math the Wizard who can randomly reward the player or transform him into a frog if he asks repeatedly.

Gameplay consists of two distinct modes: Turn based exploration and real time combat.
In turn based mode where each player can move a limited distance on the game's world map and visit various locations. Players will mostly visit the many dolmens that are scattered across the map. These places represent areas guarded by monsters. Visiting these dolmens will trigger the second main gameplay mode: real time combat. The player takes control of his chosen knight and attempts to defeat the monsters using sword combat similar to Barbarian (Palace Software) or Sword of Sodan.
Defeating the monsters rewards the player with treasures from that location. Success will also result in gaining one experience point. These then can be distributed in one of the 3 abilities: Strength, Constitution and Endurance, each to a maximum of 5.


The required amount of XP needed to advance varies according to the number of human controlled characters. This, combined with some powerful weapons that can be discovered or bought, can boost the player combat abilities. However, the difficulty of the game increases to compensate.
The overall objective of exploration is to find the lair that holds one of the four keys. The player who gathers together all four keys (either by finding them or by stealing them from rivals), will have access to the Valley of the Gods at the center of the map. The knight will have to fight against the Guardian in order to win a 'moonstone'. The moonstone corresponds randomly to a lunar phase, and grants the knight more power during that phase. The moonstone must be returned to Stonehenge for the game to be completed.
After some days, a dragon will appear and make regular sweeps across the land. In the event that an unskilled player is unfortunate enough to encounter the dragon early on in the game, defeat is almost inevitable. Skilled players, however, should be able to take advantage of the dragon's weak spot, granting them victory regardless of their current stats. The dragon's weak spot is its neck; a successful blow to the neck will render it unable to move for a short period of time. A successive series of upward thrusts from underneath the dragon makes it unable to move, as each stab stuns the dragon long enough for the knight to recover and deliver yet another attack.

Moreover, MOT has the bad habits of hiding in your cupboard, smashing all the furniture in your house from time to time or eating all the food in your fridge during the night. And of course, when you tried to explain to your parents that it wasn't you but MOT who crushed their car, they sent you to a psychiatrist.

But MOT is your friend, and you wouldn't let him down when he calls for your help, would you ?</desc>

		<desc>It is the future, and a holocaust has swept over the world.

Now, in a post-apocalyptic environment, you are set to destroy the evil Dr. A Noid, who had turned people to zombies with his artificial food called "SLU".

First, you drive through the city with your ATV, destroying enemy vehicles and avoiding mines and gun turrets. There are several buildings you can explore.

In those buildings, you walk from room to room in a gauntlet-style setting, shooting zombies and avoiding traps. You'll find ammunition, food, and hopefully the pass to the Arena.

The Arena is the third part of the game: This is a deadly destruction derby where you have to steer your ATV through the treacherous maze and destroy all the enemy vehicles by pushing them into the holes in the ground.

After surviving the Arena, you'll proceed to the next city - until you get to face Dr. A Noid himself.</desc>

		<desc>Basically a remake of the SNES game Super Troll Islands, but superficially incorporating TV character Mr Blobby, who was famous for crushing people and shouting "Blobbitty Blobbitty Blobby" or words to that effect, neither of which he does in the game.

It's essentially a platform game, but the 60 levels are reliant on you colouring in enough of the screen, by walking over it. Power ups are on offer, and the levels include some interesting design features, including ladders, spikes and springs to bounce off.

You can switch between the 3 characters (Mr Blobby, Mrs Blobby and Baby Blobby) at any point, and only lose once all 3 are out of lives. There are plenty of bad guys around, all looking identical and following pre-programmed attack paths.</desc>

As well as enemies, there are many blocks on the levels. The weapon upgrade system is build into these, which function in two different ways. Most will drop crystals, which if collected are added to a cash total. The others reveal a picture of a weapon with a price - make contact with it while carrying enough credits and the weapon will be bought. When the energy bar runs out the player loses a life. When this happens the player loses all money.</desc>

		<desc>Multi-Player Soccer Manager is a football/soccer management game that allows up to four players to play at the same time. The game has four divisions from Division 1 to Division 4 with 16 teams in each division. Each team is assembled with a squad of up to 16 players. You begin as manager of a Division 4 team which is randomly selected for you when you start the game.

Each season has a 30-game league schedule where you must finish in the top two to gain promotion to the next division. In higher leagues, the bottom two teams are relegated to the lower division. If you finish in the bottom of Division 4 you win the “league joker” trophy. If your team performs well you may get offered a job at a higher level team during the season. Teams also compete in League Cup and F.A. Cup matches as well where teams of all divisions take part and can play against each other.

Other features in the game include buying and selling players in the transfer market, arranging training for your players and increasing your ground's capacity and safety. If you run out of money, you will be sacked and offered the job of the bottom team of Division 4. If you choose decline the job, the game will end. The same occurs if you choose to resign at any time.</desc>

***Narc*** is a 1988 arcade game designed by Eugene Jarvis for Williams 
Electronics and programmed by George Petro. It was one of the first 
ultra-violent video games and a frequent target of parental criticism 
of the arcade game industry. The object is to arrest and kill drug 
offenders, confiscate their money and drugs, and defeat "Mr. Big".
















It was the first game in the newly restarted Williams Electronics 
coin-op division, and features their notable use of digitized 
graphics (later made famous in games such as Mortal Kombat). 
In fact, the quality of the graphics in terms of number of colors 
would not be surpassed until the game Mortal Kombat II 
(released in 1993). The game features what in arcade terminology is 
termed a medium resolution monitor – higher resolution than 
televisions and normal arcade monitors, although often in a smaller 
physical size. NARC was also the very first arcade game to utilize 
the TI TMS34010, which is a 32-bit processor. The game was also 
notable for the numerous voice samples used during and between 
levels.
















Narc was ported to the NES and several home computer systems in 1990.
















Programmed by David Leitch at Sales Curve Interactive and published by 
Ocean Software, the versions of the game for the ZX Spectrum and 
Amstrad CPC computers generally received positive reviews, 
including 9/10 from CRASH, 8/10 from Sinclair User and 72% from Your 
Sinclair. Matt Bielby of Your Sinclair called it "one of the most 
objectionable Speccy games I've seen in ages", and called it 
"repetitive" and the plot "utter nonsense. "

		<desc>The Naughty Ones come under your control in this old-fashioned platform game. Each screen is separate from the others, and involves trying to collect a key and then progress through the exit. Enemies are best dealt with by shooting one of your longer-range weapons towards them and waiting for it to hit them - this will release at least one coin, for points. Improved weapons can be collected, each of which functions for a limited number of shots. Bonus items are often located in the more precarious parts of the level, leading you to choose whether to risk losing a life, and going back to the start of the screen (although previously killed creatures remain dead when you lose a life).</desc>

		<desc>Like many of Ocean's games this was licensed from a film,in this case one by Orion, the company best known for Robocop. You control a succession of the USA's elite fighters with the aim of destroying missiles held by terrorists. You must destroy the missiles by placing bombs next to them and then fleeing the scene. 

You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons as the game goes on (neither of which fit with the film, or real-life logic, but make for Generic Ocean Film License #718). The gameplay is primarily side-scrolling, but the levels are taller than the screen.</desc>

		<desc>This is a sequel to highly rated Nebulus (known as "Tower Toppler" in the US). The gameplay is much the same except this time Pogo must topple the towers and then repair them aswell! Why? Well the storyline this time around is that the evil crime boss known as "The Uncle" has taken the seven Towers of Life (which produce oxygen for their respective planets) ransom!

Because the Galactic Government does not deal with terrorists, they've sent construction worker, Pogo, to deal with the problem. This is where you come in. Pogo must (as before) make it to the top of the seven towers whilst avoiding all the baddies and traps that have been laid there for him. Once he gets to the top, the tower is toppled. Now he must would over 80% of the crumbling platforms to return power back to the tower before he can move on.

There are three new subgames and several new features in Nebulus 2, such as Jumping Boots, Rockets and Magnets (for pulling Pogo up to higher platforms).</desc>

There are a wide variety of targets to hit or avoid, some stationary, some with programmed attack paths and others with artificial intelligence to close in on you. The graphics have a very metallic look, similar to Cybernoid in a way. There aren't many power-ups on offer and you aren't too dependent on them to be able to survive. However, an auto-fire joystick is strongly recommended.</desc>

		<desc>This racing game is set in the Ramsay Street universe of the Australian soap opera, which was hugely popular in the UK at the time. Nominally you play Scott Robinson, riding his skateboard in races against between one and four fellow characters – Mike Young on another skateboard, Charlene Ramsay in a go-kart, her brother Henry on a lawnmower, and Matt Robinson on a motorcycle. The eight races take in Ramsay Street, the Lassiter’s Complex, Erinsborough High School, and Anson’s Corner. There are three boards available (two on the Spectrum), trading top speed off against manoeuvrability.

Gameplay involves guiding your craft through a series of gates around a forced-perspective course. There are three levels of hazard presence available – hazards include kangaroos, emus and other (stereotypically Australian) animals, Bouncer the dog, grotty old Mrs. Mangel, and traffic bollards. Contact with any of these costs you time, and popularity (reflected by a Neighbours logo fading out along the bottom of the screen – collecting litter will restore this).</desc>

Under a time limit you have to collect diamonds to get to the next level. The game is filled with dragons, moving mines, acid spitting creatures and lots more. Your space ship is able to shoot, furthermore you can collect several power ups, such as sand glasses to ease the time limit, shield restore or items that give you invulnerability.</desc>

The gameplay is essentially platform, with multi-directional maze-like levels. Beating the obstructions requires occasional brainwork – hidden ladders are easy enough to uncover, and there are lots of hidden sections to look for. The levels are colourful, and the game has a cute look making it appear suited to younger players. Mirrors are placed around the levels, which transport you to a random place.</desc>

		<desc>Nigel Mansell's first licensed computer game recreates all 16 Formula 1 circuits of the time, viewed from behind the car but with a full cockpit-type view below. This is important because the game is very much a simulation rather than an action game.

Before each race you have to do three qualifying laps, and only make the grid if you are fast enough to meet the pre-defined qualifying limit. The races can be between 5 and 20 laps, or at full length if you prefer - fortunately a half-finished season can be saved to cassette or disk.

F1 cars of this era have turbo boosts, and this is available in the game to provide a quick blast of extra speed, which is useful for overtaking but can cause the turbo or the engine itself to be overstressed, as well as using fuel more quickly (pitstops are for tires but not fuel, again in keeping with the era's real Formula 1 rules).</desc>

		<desc>In Nightdawn, the player takes the role of an engineer who has to prove that his remote-controlled tank is better than the previous model. To do so, he needs to master a series of top-down mazes. The goal of each level is to find the exit, but it is secured with locked doors and energy barriers. Navigating the maze and finding the means to overcome the doors (finding keys) and barriers (finding switches) is the main challenge of the game, but there are also mines, turrets and patrolling robots. During the course of a level there are optional and needed upgrades to find, e.g. a cannon (initially the tank can't shoot), a mine detector, extra energy or a radar.</desc>

To accomplish this task Moonlight is armed with a katana, shurikens, bombs, and a sickle and chain weapon. Each weapon offers its own advantages and must be used at certain times to overcome specific obstacles or opponents. 

The game's coin-op origins are evident in the fact that that the home versions do not have passwords or saves. To compensate for this, however, adjustable difficulty settings were added.</desc>

		<desc>Nitro is a racing game in which four cars - up to three of them can be controlled by players - complete for the first place in over 20 levels.

These levels are divided into four themes, and a few of them are played at night: Although it's hard enough to tell which way to go in the eight-way-scrolling maps during the day, you're sure to hit many barriers and walls at night when only your headlights give you any clues about where to go.

Depending on how well you raced, you'll get money to upgrade your car - and you'll also need to refuel your car! There are three types of cars to choose from, and depending on what kind of terrain a level is on, making the right choice here can give you the edge.</desc>

		<desc>North & South is a combined strategy and action game released in 1989 for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST and ported later for NES, Amstrad CPC, MSX, DOS and ZX Spectrum. It was developed and published by Infogrames.

Taking an extremely simplified board interface, the game features a strategic map of the USA separated into states and territories, where army units are moved around. In each state which "owns" a railway station, there is a fort, the capture of which leads to the player overtaking the whole state. Otherwise, capturing a state involves simple movement, unless there is another army "on" the state. Armies can be reinforced in two ways. By turning on an option at the main menu the player controlling the state of North Carolina will get periodic reinforcements by ship. Also, railways generate money which in turn generates soldiers. Moving their army units, the player may expand westwards into unoccupied territory. If two antagonistic armies clash, it will result in a battle. There is an option on the main menu where the player can turn off in-game missions and battles to make it purely like a board game. Whenever opposing armies meet in board-game mode, the results of the battles are left to chance, with the outcome weighted towards the larger army. Either army may retreat from these battles. Whenever a side attempts to capture an enemy fort or rob a train, the result is also randomised.

		<desc>The story is told quick enough: in 1990, terrorists capture the world's largest oil reserve and threaten to blow up an atomic bomb if their demands are not met. You are (as always) the only hope of mankind and so on.

Persian Gulf Inferno is a side scrolling action/shooting game. You control your character, who is at first equipped with a handgun and two explosives, around the oil rig, shooting terrorists left & right and trying to disarm the bomb before it goes boom. You can of course aquire more weapons like the SPA-S semi shotgun and machine guns.</desc>

Nova 9 is the sequel to Dynamix's Stellar 7, a futuristic "tank" shooter, and features similar gameplay. Played from a first person perspective in the cockpit of your tank, the goal is to destroy all of the various enemies found on nine planets. John Alex's tank, the Raven II, is equipped with various weaponry and a long range scanner to help in the mission. It is also equipped with a cloaking device for emergencies. Additional power-ups such as pickup energy and enhancement modules can be either beamed in or "salvaged" from the enemy wreckage.</desc>

		<desc>This sequel to Dark Castle has our formerly nameless hero now known as Prince Duncan continuing his adventures after he toppled the Black Knight's throne and was dropped by a gargoyle in Trouble 3. With Merlin's help, Prince Duncan finds his way behind the Black Knight's throne where there is a fireplace and mantle. At the start of each new game, Duncan tries to take a torch on the wall beside the fireplace, and the entire wall spins around to reveal a large Ante Room containing 5 pedestals for holding orbs. Your mission is to collect all 5 orbs to open a gate to lead you to a final duel with The Black Knight. 

This game has similar gameplay and 15 new levels - five of which scroll as opposed to the static screens of the past. These 5 are: Swamp, Black Forest, East Labyrinth, West Labyrinth, and Black Knight's Showdown & The Final Battle. There are different enemies and items such as multiple keys and a helicopter pack which lets you fly in the Swamp and Black Forest levels. You must pick up Gas to use it also. The game map is larger with longer levels. Different elements present include weapons-based fighting, mazes, bombs which are used to destroy enemies or walls, and a health system. 

Some enemies will decrease your health when hitting you instead of killing you outright. Elixirs will protect your health but it will also deplete slowly over time and can be restored by picking up food or leaving the level. There is now the option to save your game but it must be done from one of the computers in the castle's Computer Room. There's also a new practice mode to try out levels. When playing in Advanced mode, there's a different ending to the game than normal.</desc>

Four X1 boats armed with missiles tough it out over circuits set up in lakes and lined with rocks, desperately trying to avoid finishing last, as this will eliminate them from future competition. Contact with other boats can also be harmful, and will cost you time.</desc>

When on offense, the player can rotate to keep away from his rival, take a shot from a distance or move in to the basket for special up-close slam-dunks. When on defense, you can try to take your rival's ball or jump up to block a shot. Particularly good set-ups get a slow-motion replay. You can even smash the glass on the backboard, which will send an irate janitor onto the court to clean up the mess.</desc>

		<desc>In One Step Beyond you are Colin Curly, a dog, who loves Quavers (snack). It was a stormy night and Colin was playing his favorite game Pushover. Accidentally, Colin has been digitized and curlified into his computer at the moment he completed the final level of the game. Colin has been trapped inside his own computer and an amazing array of challenges are standing between him and the escape from this electronic nightmare.

You have to move Colin Curly from the ENTRY packet to the EXIT packet by jumping from one platform to the next. Colin can only escape from a level if ALL the platforms have shut before he reaches the exit.

As Colin steps off a platform, it will slide shut behind him, never to open again unless it has special properties. So, it is important to work out the correct route to follow in order to close all the platforms before Colin reaches the EXIT while still being able to move around the level.</desc>

The bulk of the game is side-scrolling platform hack 'n' slash action, with mines to avoid on the route. You can collect a number of spells, and select them using the function keys. Your physical and mental energy are measured separately throughout the game, and must both be kept high.</desc>

		<desc>In Ooops Up, you are a space traveller lost in space. You have to travel to 100 stars (or levels), to collect the necessary components to build a new space-ship, one that is able to get you back to earth.

The game plays a lot like the more well-known Pang. Each level is a single screen, and to complete it, you have to destroy some bouncing asteroids. If you touch one of them, or the time runs out, you lose one life.

Your weapon is some sort of harpoon, that can only shoot straight up. When it hits an asteroid, the asteroid splits into two smaller versions of itself, unless it's already the smallest variant. If that's the case, it finally gets destroyed. When all asteroids are destroyed, you travel to the next star. Repeat this 100 times, and your ship will be completed, and the game is won.

You can also get different bonus-items, such as a gun, time-stoppers, shields making you temporarily invulnerably, and other stuff.</desc>

		<desc>In a setting familiar to most horror fans, you must negotiate a variety of creepy events while exploring Carfax Abbey, an ancient dilapidated house that's become your new home. The unusual second-person perspective parser, simplistic but fair puzzles, and good atmosphere makes this a pleasant game that falls short of Infocom's classic horror IF Lurking Horror, but is still a worthy attempt despite banal plot and amateurish writing.</desc>

		<desc>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.

You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted, you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose, and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane, proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.

There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.</desc>

		<desc>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?

Operation Wolf is an arcade game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds.

You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial.

Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</desc>

		<desc>The Oriental Games offer skilled martial artists the chance to prove themselves in Kung Fu, Kendo and the relatively brutal Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai., using “courage, skill and flare” (sic) according to the packaging. It makes for a series of one-on-one fights viewed from the side.

Kendo involves using a stick as your weapon, whereas Kung Fu various punches and kicks and Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai involves head butts and flying attacks. You can jump over opponents; a quick tap of the fire button turns you around. You have an energy bar with 5 blocks of gradually decreasing colours, which drops when you are hit and increases as you pass time without being hit. Impressive moves earn you bonus Merit Awards.

On the 16-bit versions, there are 3 skill levels (Novice, Professional and Master), digitised sound, and an editor to set up joystick moves. The 8-bit versions lack these niceties, but include an extra discipline, Sumo; these are played in sequence rather than by choice.</desc>

		<desc>1994 saw the release of Action game called Ork Attack: The Return on the Amiga systems, created and published by Ian West for free as a Public Domain.

Essentially this is a game in which the player patrols the top of the castle and drops rocks onto the Orkish enemies who are trying to scale the wall. Should an Ork make it to the top then the player can call for their trusty sword and chop of the offending invaders head. What makes this game difficult is that there can only ever be one rock on screen at a time and while the player is holding their sword no new rocks will appear.

Randomly throughout the game a chief Ork will appear. They ascend slower than their companion Orks and can only be killed by dropping a rock on their head. If a chief makes it to the top then it's game over.
Between levels there is a time limited bonus round where the player must sweep defeated Ork bodies into the moat.</desc>

The 28 levels are basically a big escort mission: in order to to protect the steadily moving ship, the player has to destroy all opposition waiting ahead in the usual shooter way. However, there are also blocks in the way which need to be destroyed by ramming them into each other. When they are destroyed in the correct way, they reveal power ups like new weapons, weapon upgrades, life energy, or shields. In order to keep the ship from crashing into non-destroyable blocks, the player has to connect to the ship and change the direction it steers to. When connected, the players own ship can't shoot.</desc>

		<desc>Overdrive is practically two games in one. First, you have the arcade game, where you have to race against a succession of drivers, each better than the one before, until you reach the final challenge and claim victory. The second game is a time-trials challenge, where you have to race a variety of vehicles over a number of courses against the clock. This is slightly easier than the arcade version and gives you the option to get some practice in.

You have four different cars to control in Overdrive, ranging from a GP to a Super sports car. All have their own strengths and weaknesses, as you would expect. The controls are very responsive, and it goes without saying that it's incredibly playable. What makes it so tough is the speed. Everything just whips along at such a rate that it's often hard to anticipate corners, and you end up careering all over the shop. Overdrive lets you link up two machines via the null modem cable.

Of course, it can't all be good, or it would have got a mark of 100%. The biggest problem is the horrendous loading times. As the levels vary greatly, the game has to load in complete graphics for each race, which can take a lot longer than the race itself in some cases!</desc>

So what do you do? Sit in the sun getting skin cancer? No, instead you drive a super-fast car and are paid to transport dodgy goods from city to city. To liven up the journey other motorists try to ram you off the road or just shoot you! It's just as well there's a shopping centre nearby where you can buy essential stuff like turbos, battering rams, flame bombs, and rockets.

The undulating road's quite good, but other than that the graphics are bland and badly animated with poor collision detection. Complementing them perfectly, the simple roadblasting gameplay will drive you mad with boredom.</desc>

Using a Transnuclear Hypernipple device he beams some fearsome enemies from a parallel dimension, who can see thorough his plan to wreck life as the Oxxonians know it - making them unable to eat their staple food, popcorn gateaus.

In order to fix the situation, the player has to explore mazes, shoot enemies and find food, new weapons, money and tools. Badly all these things are hidden in boxes, of which there are several types. Opening boxes is not very easy: only if three boxes of one kind are standing beside each other, they open. The player can push and pull boxes (like Sokoban).

Energy is decreasing constantly and therefore a constant time pressure is on the player.</desc>

		<desc>P. P. Hammer and his Pneumatic Weapon is a platform game with puzzle elements. It draws obvious influence from the earlier game Lode Runner. In the game, you control a character called P. P. Hammer, who is on a quest to discover and acquire all treasures from a series of more than 60 levels. These levels are divided into four graphical themes: Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, Medieval castles, and ice. A fifth theme, LegoLand, appears on bonus levels.

Each level in the game is made up of rectangular blocks, and contains various things including treasures, enemies, locked doors, bonus items and traps. P. P. Hammer carries a jackhammer, which allows him to drill through a block he's standing next to. As in Lode Runner, drilling through more than one layer of blocks requires creating a triangle-shaped cavity more than one block wide, and blocks reappear after a short while. A block reappearing on top of P. P. Hammer kills him.

P. P. Hammer can collect treasures and various power-up potions lying around the level. When he has collected all the treasures, the exit door opens, and going through the exit door completes the level. The player doesn't have to play from the beginning of the game every time; after completing each level a level password is displayed, allowing the player to continue from that point at a later time.

Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

***Pac-Mania*** (パックマニア Pakku-Mania?) is an arcade video game in the 
Pac-Man series, released by Namco in 1987 and distributed by Atari Games 
in the United States and Europe. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware and 
was the last Pac-Man game to run on an arcade cabinet until 1996.




The game was converted to most of the popular home formats of the time. 
These versions of the game were generally well received, especially on 
the 8-bit systems. The game was runner-up in the category of Best 
Coin-Op Conversion of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards, behind 
Operation Wolf.

		<desc>Sequel to the 1990 bestseller game Team Yankee.

While using the same split screen interface as the predecessor, the game now features an enhanced graphics engine, showing the game world much more detailed as it has been shown in Team Yankee. 

The game is still a mixture of a realistic tank simulation and a strategy wargame. Whereas the predecessor uses the story from the book, this game's story is fictional. A Soviet communist has occupied the Yama Yama Isles in the South Pacific which are an important strategic base in this area. You'll have to regain control of the islands in five missions.</desc>

		<desc> The plot follows John Milton's poem from 1667 loosely. You begin your quest to defeat Satan in a cave where you fight various normal and some mid and end level bosses. Afterwards you exit the cave to enter level 2 that leads you through an open area with bridges that is quickly passed. In the next level your goal is to defeat twenty evil creatures and obtain their souls as an ammunition that you'll use against Satan himself. This level is presented in a third person perspective in contrary to the other horizontally scrolling levels. After you've collected the twenty souls, you fall through a hole in the ground to face a hydra. Once you defeat the hydra you finally enter the last stage in which you face Satan himself after a short stage with a Greek ambiance.</p> The soundtrack matches the atmostphere of the game really well. The coding is well done and you don't see any slowdowns throughout the game. The graphics reach from simple to well drawn and overall fits into the style of the game. The gameplay is simple, but offers variation. Overall it's a short, but interesting visit to the depths of hell.</p> Paradise Lost was intially sent to HOL by the developer Mert Börü with the request to include the game in HOL in April 2013. Mert included two releases of the game in his upload that the HOL team used to take the screenshots. One version was the original 4 disk release of the game and another one was included with a built-in unlimted energy trainer. Mert Börü kindly gave permission to host both releases directly on OAGD.net, so everybody can experience this long lost Turkish game.</p></desc>

This is a traditional, side-scrolling platformer in which the player walks from left to right while avoiding enemies (respectively killing them with the laser gun) and jumping over gaps. Additionally there is the need to hurry because each level has a time limit. There are various extras to collect on the way, e.g. shoes for a higher jump, smart bombs to get rid of multiple enemies at once, extra time or extra lives.</desc>

		<desc>This is a conversion of the SEGA coin-op game of the same name, playing lawn tennis around the world. The player travels from France, to Australia, to the US and end up in England and get to listen to the national anthem of each country.

There are four difficulty levels to select the skill of the computer controlled player. One or two players may play but always against the computer. In a two player game, both players play as a doubles team.

The game starts off looking behind the player as the style of serve is chosen (top spin, curve, etc) and then it switches to a top down view for the rally.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, an evil demon called Satan has spread chaos in the world, and someone has to stop him. This is where you come in. Playing as the hero Perseus, you have to go to 5 different worlds, each with its own theme, and kill Satan's guardians (end of level bosses). A friendly wizard has also given you a magical flying horse called Pegasus, to help you in your quest.

Each world has 10 levels, and half of them are played flying on Pegasus back, and the other half walking, without your magical horse. When flying, the game plays like a Shoot'em up, but when walking, it's a platform game, and you have to rely on your sword.

You can buy weapon upgrades and other bonuses, if you collect enough diamonds. They can be found spread out all over the levels, and fallen enemies drop them sometimes as well. If your health drops too low, you can also heal yourself by spending some diamonds.

After every world, you get a password, letting you continue from the same place the next time you play. That's fortunate, because this game takes a long time to complete.</desc>

		<desc>Penthouse Hot Numbers is basically the same game as the publisher's previous Sexy Droids with new pictures; this time nude photographs from 15 Penthouse models.

Two opponents (the second either human or AI) compete on a 8x8 grid field. The players take turns and each one clicks on a field which has two effects: a part of the photograph is revealed and the player gets positive or negative points; depending on the field's colour. The catch is that one player can move the cursor only horizontally and the other is restricted to vertical movements. The game ends when no more moves are possible and the player with the most points wins.</desc>

		<desc>Licensed around former England player Peter Beardsley, this football (soccer) game is viewed side-on. The only playing option is the European Championship tournament of the day, although you can choose the 8 teams from the 26 major European footballing nations of the time (so the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are all still complete). Two players can compete in these groups, but there's no guarantee of getting straight to a 2-player game, especially as tournaments (and individual matches) can't be quit out of.

The gameplay features variable strength kicks, determined by how long you hold the fire button for. In a break with realistic physics, the ball ricochets back in the direction it came from. Goalkeepers stay on the goal-line rather than using the whole penalty box.</desc>

		<desc>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</desc>

		<desc>Digital Illusions was not involved in the fourth title in 21st Century's pinball series, with this version instead being developed by veteran pinball game producers Spidersoft. 

Four tables are featured: Kick Off centres around soccer/football, Jail Break is set in a prison, Tarantula reflects Spidersoft's name and logo as it features a rampant spider, and Jackpot is based around gambling.

There are sequences of lights to activate, ramps to guide the ball through, and flippers to keep it in play. Multiball can be activated in set ways, to bring a second ball into play. The flippers are not as powerful as in previous games in the series.</desc>

		<desc>The goal of the game is to help Pink Panther guide his sleepwalking employer through his house without waking him up. To help you in this, Panther can use various items, such as a little bell, which he can use to attract the sleeping man.

The game is a sidescrolling adventure and takes mostly place in the house of the employer. Pink Panther can himself move freely in the house, but at the same time he needs to keep his eye on the sleepwalker, so that he can prevent him from stumbling on various objects, such as rugs and tables.

Before each level you can purchase different kind of objects from a store. These items can be used to gently lure the sleeping man in the right path.</desc>

		<desc>Pinomania is a puzzle board game, a clone of a classic game Pentomino with the appearance of as a static Tetris. The goal of the player is to fill a pattern picture with all the available blocks. The blocks may be turned in every direction and flipped. Each level allows to make a designated number of checks, showing correct placed blocks. The blocks may be removed from the board back to the clipboard. There is no limit of trials. After completing the level players receive a level code. The game consists of 80 levels all together, all use the same set of 12 blocks.</desc>

		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

		<desc>The colonization of space goes well, but there are not enough humans to do all the work. So scientists engineered androids which are constructed on one planet. Unfortunately they got infected with a virus and they mutated into monsters. A hero, optically representing a barbarian despite the science-fiction scenario, has to clean this mess up.

The Plague is a traditional shooter of the "run and gun" variety. The player walks through the four side-scrolling levels while shooting everything which moves. There is also bit of platforming and dodging involved: getting hit by enemies result the energy bar to go down which eventually leads to death. The protagonist wields a machine gun which can be upgraded by collecting power ups and makes a big blast when holding the fire button for a time. A limited amount of smart bombs can be used to kill everything on screen. The sprites are relatively big and every level has a boss.</desc>

		<desc>Little time has passed since the events of Police Quest, when Sonny Bonds climbed the ranks of the Lytton police department and became the key element in the arrest of Jesse Bains, the notorious drug lord. After the trial, Sonny's application to the Homicide division was accepted and proposed to Marie, who had her prostitution charges dropped and started a new life away from the streets. Life was good - until Bains escaped, taking advantage of a low-security prison and an inexperienced correctional officer. Sonny is now in danger from a vengeful Bains and is saddled with his new chain-smoker partner Keith. Sonny goes to the field again to capture Bains, but things are about to get awfully personal...

Using Sierra's new SCI engine, the graphics are more vibrant than in the first game, but gameplay remains basically the same, with the player ordering Sonny to move to a place in the scene (either using the directional keys or the new mouse interface) and a parser interface to interact with the game world. Game sequences are more varied, and include a shooting range, an underwater search or searching the inside of an escape vehicle. The driving sequences are gone, and the player can relax while reading the chatter between Sonny and Keith as they move from location to location. The approach to the game, however, is radically different. While the first (for a large part) is based on street police work, this sequel is oriented into forensics field work such as collecting evidences that link Bains into the happenings of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Sonny Bonds, the sergeant of Lytton police department, thought he could finally enjoy peaceful life with his wife Marie after the drug lord Jessie Bains has been put away for good. However, a series of gruesome murders perpetrated by a sinister cult known as "The Kindred" shocks the city. Marie becomes a victim of their attack and falls into a coma. It becomes Sonny's very personal mission to track down the attackers and make them pay for their crimes.

The Kindred is the third installment of the Police Quest series, its events taking place after those described in The Vengeance. The game brings back some of the elements of the first game, such as a modified version of driving sequences and police procedures unrelated to the main plot the protagonist must go through. Computer work is particularly emphasized, requiring the player to perform tasks such as using facial composite software or figuring out murder patterns by studying a map. Like other Sierra adventures of the time, the game uses an icon-based interface for interaction with the environment.</desc>

		<desc>Located on the northern shore of the Moonsea in Forgotten Realms, Phlan was once a flourishing trade city. However, lately monsters began settling in it, gradually turning whole districts into ruins. Only New Phlan remained under human control, but its inhabitants are afraid to venture into the monster-infested areas. In order to clean the nearby Barren River and rebuild Phlan, local authorities spread rumors about alleged riches hidden somewhere in the city. A party of adventurers, attracted by these news, sails towards Phlan and accepts the quest.

Pool of Radiance is the first adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons role-playing system in a computer game format. In the beginning of the game the player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one.

Exploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts. Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest. Non-human characters can also "multi-class" (learn the abilities of another class) when leveling up.</desc>

		<desc>Pool is a game about pool billiard. There is one opponent to compete against (either controlled by the AI or another player) without further possibilities for customization. The control method is divided into two distinct parts: first the basic position of the cue is set in a top down view. After that the game switches to a first-person perspective where the player can fine-tune the cue to select the spin (the game gives the parameters of the current position). Finally the shot is performed with a mouse click. For both parts the player is on a time limit of about ten seconds each.</desc>

		<desc>Strange happenings are afoot once again in Sweethaven and only Popeye can make it right. In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.

Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.

The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.

Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.</desc>

		<desc>Ports of Call is a maritime trading simulation game. It was published by the company Aegis Interactive Software in 1987 for Amiga 500/600 (OCS/ECS) and 1990 for IBM PC, the Amiga version was graphically and sonically superior, according to the still rather limited multimedia capabilities of PCs. In a new version (XXL), the game is now also play on the PC in a contemporary graphic, among others, port entrances and exits in 3D.

The player is the owner of a shipping company and buys at the start of the game some ships to transport goods across the oceans. Important is not just a lucky hand in the trade and the choice of the freighter, but also a little skill, because the player must maneuver his ship often even in the port of destination and thereby control the speed and course. Sometimes you have but also move your ship through reefs or similar. The graph is quite simple and will take place in the plan view. There is also a weather system, through which one can caught in a storm at sea. Even the entry into ports of the trouble spots of the world is very dangerous as pirates and infectious diseases .

If you make it to the shipping company successfully in the black, you have the opportunity to buy high-tech ships.

		<desc>P.O.W. is the second light-gun game for the Commodore Amiga similar in style to Operation Wolf. The premise is to rescue a group of trapped US soldiers from hostile territory.

The game takes place in following locations and terrains: jungle, bridge, village, armory, swamp, radio tower, prison camp and beach. Armed with your machine gun and a few rockets you must shoot enemy soldiers and vehicles (tanks, helicopters, submarines) while avoiding the innocent bystanders. You can also shoot bonus icons that include additional ammo and health.

The screen is scrolling sideways and play became faster as the game progress. There are three levels of difficulty and three corresponding maps a player could follow.</desc>

There are 3 types of stages - individual time-trials, head-to-head races against the computer, and some skill tests. There are 8 rounds of gameplay, set across countries ranging from Sweden to Kenya. The player gets prize money for winning races, and it costs money to repair damage.</desc>

		<desc>The Power is a puzzle game with similarities to Atomix: The player takes the role of the blob Max who has to collect all hearts divided over the level and then go to his girlfriend Mimi; all within a time limit. However, when Max starts walking into one direction, he only stops when he touches a block. The player also has access to certain blocks of three colours which can be moved with the same rules as Max, but when blocks with a certain colour combination crash against each other (e.g. a moving red onto a green) they vaporize. The game features two playing modes, arcade and tactic, with the basic difference that the arcade mode scrolls and the tactics mode fits each level in one screen.</desc>

		<desc>As one of the four great Gods Apollo, Hermes, Hecate and Aphrodite, choose a team of four mighty warriors to fight for you in the Powerplay tournament to prove who is the greatest. This battle will be fought out not using swords or knives, but with knowledge - gameplay takes the form of a complex quiz on a chess-like board.

You have four playing pieces, which start off arranged as a cross in one corner of the isometrically-viewed board. The squares are split into four different colours, which each represent a particular broad Trivial Pursuit-style subject area. The question has four possible answers, and a correct answer allows you to move your piece one space, perhaps onto one of the four white teleport squares (which randomly places it on one of those four squares).

When a piece lands on the same square as an opposition piece, a challenge ensues, which plays out like a quiz show, with questions asks in quick fire and the first player to answer gaining a point if right and losing one if wrong. The losing piece drops down a skill level.

Once a piece reaches 25 Wisdom Points, it can mutate up a skill level - this makes it harder to beat, but makes the questions it faces harder.</desc>

		<desc>In the Premier Manager series you lead a team from the Conference, the fifth division of English football, into the Premier League and onto European glory. Sign the right players and sell the bad ones to improve your squad. As in previous games in the series, the telephone puts you in touch with your staff, such as coaches to improve your players' skills and a scout to find new players. Stadium improvements (room for more supporters, undersoil heating, a better supporters' club) and sponsorship (assigning a brand to each piece of the stands around and above the pitch) are largely unchanged from PM2.

New to this version is the Assistant Manager - if you can sign a quality one, he can do jobs such as training for you. Tactical depth is increased in PM3 - each player can be assigned a position on the pitch depending on which sector the ball is in, in a manner similar to Sensible World of Soccer. Match coverage is fuller than in earlier versions, with an isometrically-viewed pitch displaying each touch in detail, helping you work our why your team lost 5-0, and how to stop it happening again.</desc>

		<desc>The first game in Gremlin's series of football management games. You start off managing a team in the Conference (the fifth tier of English football) and aim to progress up the leagues, either by improving your existing team or earning jobs at better clubs elsewhere.

The features at your disposal include selecting training regimes, planning tactics for each match based on your opposition's strengths and weaknesses, scouting for new players including youth prospects, and arranging sponsorship and stadium improvements (so as to attract more fans).

The transfer system is a crucial part of the game, as you aim to sign players (who are broadly rated in each of the main skill areas) up against other teams who want them, and sell off players you don't need. You have an overdraft available, but make sure not to exceed it.

The game supports up to 4 players, whose matches all take place at the same time. You can make tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.</desc>

		<desc>Prime Mover is a motorcycle racing action game, viewed from behind the bike. There are twelve riders and five bikes (with different top speeds, acceleration and handling) to choose from. The full championship includes 12 races against a field of seven riders (computer opponents are loosely named after real riders of the day – Rain Wayney and Lucie Kavanora for example). 

Circuits are set around the world, with various weather effects, with a rendition of each national anthem played on the pre-race screen. Handling is loose and arcadey. It is not possible to fall off – contact with hazards or other bikes simply results in you losing time.</desc>

		<desc>If this 'simulator' is to be believed, powerboat racing is a chaotic race across a number of largely one-directional tracks with fjords and inlets forcing you down one of two lanes, and sections where a bridge needs to be cleared by hitting a ramp at the right speed beforehand (as you jump over these, you can land so as to skim off other boats). Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall.</desc>

		<desc>This tennis game offers bare-bones action for one or two players. There are 3 computer skill levels on offer, and matches can be 1, 3 or 5 sets. The gameplay is viewed from above and behind the net, with a slight 3D effect. The type of shot played is determined by how high the ball is as you hit it. The full service rules are implemented, and the fire button must be pressed once to throw the ball up, and a second time to hit it with the racket.</desc>

		<desc>Endorsed by famous tennis player, Jimmy Connors, this game offers tournament and single play on multiple court types.

Using crosshairs, aim your ball to the other side of the court and hope you hit where you want. If you are lucky, you might even score an Ace. If not, you will need to be ready to return your opponent's return. Run back and forth as you try to keep hitting the ball over the net until your opponent misses, or you do. When you hit the ball, you will want to attempt changing the direction and speed of the ball to throw your opponent off balance. This is the real challenge of any tennis game.</desc>

		<desc>Projectyle is a single or multiplayer (1 to 3 players) hockey-type sports game of the future. It features smooth-scrolling, frantic action, colorful graphics and digital music.

A total of five goal rooms, arranged in the shape of a cross, are connected with tunnels. The camera smoothly follows the puck/ball (the "projectyle") and scrolls to the adjacent rooms when entering one of the connecting tunnels. Each player, whether computer-controlled or not, has a room in which his own goal is located (their "defense" zone.) A fourth room -- the Frantic Zone -- contains a goalmouth for each player, while the central room, where action begins, allows access to the four other rooms.

The object of the game is for each player to protect their own goal while trying to bring the puck/ball into the other players' rooms to score a goal. Bonuses appear randomly in the rooms, allowing the player who passes on them to gain some benefits, such as freezing the other players for a few seconds, gaining extra stamina, or sealing exits.

The game supports up to 3 player simultaneous quick action single game play, and can support up to 8 players in leagues of varying lengths. League/tournament play supports player/team management, including training, injuries and position reassignment.</desc>

		<desc>ProSoccer 2190 is set in the future in which soccer tournaments are mix between real-life outdoor and indoor soccer. The most important difference to outdoor soccer is that there is no out because the ball bounces back from the indoor walls. The three other changes are the different match division (four quarters à 15 minutes), a time-out system and that the athletes wear American Football helmets.

The player takes control of one of 16 fictional teams and, depending on the team's origin, participates in either the American or European league. The winners of each league fight for the championship. During the matches, the player either controls the athlete with the ball when in offense or switches between athletes when in defense. When starting a shot, the game switches to "kick mode" in which the player needs to position the cursor in a box. Depending on the position, this changes the power, swerve and elevation of the shot.

The player also has a few management jobs to take care of, mostly player transfers between seasons and choosing the lineup for the next match. Every athlete has a set of statistics which influence his performance during matches, e.g. the result of duels. After calling a time-out, the player can make a substitution or change the tactical system.</desc>

		<desc>You are a psyborg named Duncan Norton, who must travel through the vortex from a space vessel trapped in a galaxy very far from Earth. An alien race is threatening to take over 38 planets and you've got to stop them. 

Starting from Anacreon, you will mentally pass through the Krypton, Kalgan, Zorgon, Terminus, Trantor, and finally Sol systems. Each stellar system has a certain number of planets, which you will traverse from one to another. 

The game is a first-person virtual reality race, where you run as fast as possible on the tiles that are formed in a pentagonal prism. At the starting point you accelerate, and then change the facets of the prism in order to avoid falling through the gaps. When the tile's path spirals, you may decelerate your velocity. Time runs out, and you must refill your time meter by standing on tiles marked with a "T". Standing on certain tiles that are marked with shapes of different blinking colors will give you a different amount of points. Special actions, such as jumping from one part of prism to another as well as teleporting forward and back, may be performed. Save points are placed on the track but the number of prism facets may change during your run.

Finishing the race to each planet will give you a password, which may be used later to start from this point. The best scores will be written in High Scores table.

The game is available for 1 or 2 players.</desc>

		<desc>Pub Trivia Simulator is a game that attempts to simulate an Arcade Quiz Machine found in public houses. The idea is to move up a pyramid answering questions on various subjects to reach the top so you can attempt another pyramid but for money. Before you start the game you can select how many players (1-4), which question block to load (1-3) and which avatar for your player.

The game costs 10p and you select a square on the bottom row of the pyramid with various categories. When you have selected your question you then move to a new screen and press the start button. The question appears with the choice of three answers and you must answer before a timer reaches zero and if you get it correct you receive points and move back to the pyramid screen. You pick a new question on a new row and one that is touching the square you last answered. If you get it wrong and you are on the bottom row of the first pyramid you can try again but get it wrong at any other time and it is game over. The next player if selected now plays and if you have any money then you can play again after the other players turns.

If you reach the top of the pyramid and answer the question correctly then you move to the money maze. This is another pyramid similar to the first one but now has money hidden on certain squares. If you answer a question correctly with money then it is added to the bank and allows you to carry on if you get any questions wrong. Once all players have finished then the points collected during the game goes towards a high score.</desc>

When moving, Putty has a natural bounce, and his eyes are loosely attached, moving after his body after falls (as a visual effect). He has many moves available - he can stretch himself to traverse larger gaps between (or move up/down) platforms, unleash a long-range punch, explode (which works like a smart bomb, clearing the screen of enemies) or flatten himself into a puddle on the floor (to absorb anything that walks over him).</desc>

		<desc>In Pyramax, the player takes the role of an explorer on the search of the Thaalian crystal, a priceless artifact from a long extinguished race. This crystal is at the top of a six-level pyramid which naturally has to be conquered first. Each level consists of a number of rooms which have to be solved in a linear order by activating a touchstone. So the player walks through the rooms in a top-down perspective while dodging the enemies - contact causes the life meter to go down and an empty bar results in losing a live. Picking up power ups rewards bonus points, health refreshments, extra lives or smart bombs.</desc>

		<desc>Q-bic is loosely based upon the arcade classic. Fuzzball (AKA Q*Bert) and has been written by Ronald Weeserik. Ronald's no stranger to writing classic games on the Amiga and a few of his smashes are Silkworm, SWIV and Rodland.

The idea is to guide a blobby little sprite around a three dimensional pyramid by hopping from square to square and lighting up all the cubes in the structure. It all sounds very simple, but Ronald has included some devious nasties to compete with your sprite. Bubbles roll down the pyramid from top to bottom, whilst other similarly-shaped creatures may roll down and move from side to side.

Amazingly, Weeserik has chosen to release Q-bic onto the bulletin board circuit, and is not hoping to make any money out of the venture. Game is released as a Coverdisk on CU Amiga disk 41.</desc>

		<desc>Quadralien is a real-time puzzle game in the tradition of Sokoban.

The future: Mankind's space stations throughout the solar system are powered by a huge space reactor, called Astra. Astra is about to break down. The enemy race of Quadraliens has captured the reactor; now, contamination is rising and total failure is imminent. The last chance are six remotely controlled droids, which are to clean Astra and destroy the Quadrailen mother in Astras core.

You're controlling two robots in each of the 19 levels, cleaning up the contamination on your way. Gameplay is a variation of Sokoban: You've got to push spheres in the right direction to clear the way. However, the spheres are magnetically charged, meaning that they repell or attract each other. You've got to consider chain reactions. 

Before entering a level, you may chose which robots to take with you. Each droid has different abilities, like higher range of movement, higher capacity to carry contaminated materials, or a magnetic charge of its own. You can blast your way out of hopeless situations with a limited number of detonators, and you may restart every level with already removed contamination staying removed. However, there's a time limit for the whole game in form of reactor core temperature and energy, so be quick!</desc>

		<desc>Quadrel is a puzzle game in which you must fill each piece of the selected layout with different colored paints, without painting two adjacent pieces the same color.

At the beginning of a game, you can select the desired image or layout, as well as whether you wish to play with unlimited time or not. You can also select the "Imposed" game mode, in which the game points which piece you must fill next. Each layout has a set amount of paint available for use, in four different colors: red, green, blue and yellow. The amount of brush stokes left for each color is indicated on your palette. Some layouts have a large amount of a particular color and a very small amount of another, while other layouts have a more even amount of each color. The goal is to plan well from the start, so as to avoid running out of a particular color that will be needed to finish the layout.

The game can be played in solitaire mode, against the computer, or against another human player on the same screen. There are no sound effects during gameplay, only music. If you manage to finish a layout, you can enter your name in a high score table.</desc>

Pressing the fire button makes Lord Agravain thrust his sword forward. Pressing fire while holding down makes him throw a weapon (the default one is a small lance). Like in Ghosts 'N Goblins, when the knight is hit he loses his armor. If he is attacked while semi-nude, he dies. There are several power-ups scattered throughout the 4 sets of levels (a cross paralyzes the enemies, a star gives invulnerability, etc). The game starts with three lives and has no form of saving progress.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated. 

You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you have a certain amount of time to defeat them.

You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give you chocolate eggs.

Besides gold keys, you can also collect silver keys. This lets you unlock a gate, giving you access to more shots or power-ups. There are also booby traps in the level, such as spikes, and some parts of a level are blocked off by spikes. Get a mushroom and they turn into flowers that you can pick up. Beware, getting another mushroom will make them turn into spikes again. 

Apart from the normal levels, there are challenges where you have to complete a level and get all the fruit as you can under a 20-second time limit. Depending on gameplay, there are also tricks where the last key you have to get flies away and you have to catch it. Other tricks include turning on the lights to see enemies, and running away from the "happy ghost". You'll receive bonus points at the end of the level if you manage to collect every gem in the level.

Qwak can be played as either a one or two player game. The game was released at budget price, and later on a CD double pack with Alien Breed '92.</desc>

		<desc>An eccentric old millionaire stored all his gems and money in odd places around his mansion. When he dies, his widow is unable to find any of this, so she hires master thief Devon Aire to look in the places his criminal mindset suggests it will be stored.

Each room of the house is viewed isometrically, and contains all the features you would expect to find in a large house, from cookers and telephones to pool tables and paintings. Each one can be picked up, pushed, pulled and used, with the diamonds located in intricate and surprising places.

Due to Mr. Croucher's keen interest in experimental science, there are also monsters moving through the rooms. Contact with these reduces some of the energy on one of your 3 lives.</desc>

		<desc>With $100000 in the bank after taking out loans and selling stocks, it's time to start a railroad! Choose from 4 scenarios across two continents with randomly generated resources, and design your own railroad that moves people and goods across the country. Use the revenue to continue expanding, while keeping control of your company and appeasing your stock holders with growth and revenues. Play the stock market with company assets. Drive your competitors out of business with buyouts and rate wars. Multiple types of resources to carry (roughly grouped as slow freight, fast freight, passengers, mail) and convert, own facilities to maximize profit (buy a steel mill and the conversion from iron ore to steel makes money for YOU). Use the latest available technology to your advantage (new locomotives). Your objective is to retire with a huge bonus (based on your company's assets) and become the President or the Prime Minister (depending on which continent). 

The game is essentially a bird's-eye-view real-time strategy game with aspects of building and stock market manipulation. Each fiscal period is 2-years, which corresponds to 1-day of track time. Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different.</desc>

Using the power to cast rainbows, trapping anything underneath, the boys must ascend vertically 4 levels each island, with a big, bad boss at the end of each.

By trapping beasts under your rainbows, then jumping on them to break them you can collect seven different colored gems, and there are also power-ups for extra speed and rainbows.</desc>

		<desc>Rambo's mission is set deep in Afghanistan, in the days when the Soviets occupied it, and America was putting this right (we won't mention who they enlisted to do so). Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped by the Soviets, and you've gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film.

In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect.

Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.</desc>

		<desc>Red Heat is based on the Walter Hill film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. You take control of Soviet detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), who travels to Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta. 

The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, grant you access to bonus levels, or cause you to lose control of Danko for a few seconds.</desc>

Ten different circuits are featured in the game's championship, although there are no bike setup options. The graphical detail level can be set, which affects the game's running speed and smoothness.

The mouse is used for control, with options to vary the sensitivity of the response as well as the skill of the opposition. The game keeps track of how many times you punted an opponent off, and how many times you endangered one with your riding.</desc>

		<desc>This is the scrolling beat 'em up by Technos which started the Kunio / Nekketsu High series. The original takes takes place in a Japanese city, whereas its western version named Renegade is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn. This conversion later produced unofficial sequels Target: Renegade and Renegade III: The Final Chapter. You must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.</desc>

		<desc>Hoverforce takes place in the year 2050 where enemies known as 'alterants' have taken control of the city by distributing mind controlling drugs. You play with a 3-D view from a hovercraft in an attempt to destroy all alterants and stop the drug runs they make.

The story is slightly different in Resolution 101. This game is set in the USA in the city of Las Envegas. Crime is rife and law enforcement just cannot cope so in 2038 a new law, Resolution 101, was passed which allows convicted felons to be released from jail in return for tracking down and eliminating gangland bosses.

The player takes the role of one of these 'Search and Destroy' criminals. They are given a Theta 4000 ground skimmer armed with a light machine gun and they play their way through a series of increasingly difficult levels. Each level starts with a meeting with the sheriff who names the new target. After that the player is in their skimmer patrolling the streets shooting things, not mind controlled alterants but the drug runner's henchmen and gangland minions (same sprites different names).

The city of Las Envegas is divided into four areas each of which is controlled by a separate drug runner. The during the course of the game's twelve levels the player must defeat each runner three times in order to finally kill them. The runners have minions who will attack the player as they pursue their quest for justice / freedom. As these are destroyed they leave behind cash and drugs that can be collected, the drugs must be collected as evidence.

As a further complication the drug runner only makes a few runs through the city in each level so the player must collect the evidence and shoot them down before the last run is complete, otherwise the sheriff will be displeased and the player will lose a life. Around the city are three shops where the player can upgrade weapons, and repair shields or their skimmer.</desc>

		<desc>All is not well in Endor. Those imperial stormtroopers are harassing the populace, the "aww"-inspiring, oh-so-cute Ewoks.

Leia and Luke are a bit cut off in the forests of Endor - sounds painful - and have to run the gauntlet of stormtroopers on Speederbikes. The whole bit is like Spy Hunter with a Zaxxon perspective, plus added trees and Ewok traps. The second bit has Lando Calrissian piloting the Millennium Falcon down the reactor tube of the Death Star. Using the same perspective as the forest bit, it is basically a question of avoiding the sticky-out bits and the annoying little Tie fighter bits. Now you are Chewbacca at the controls of a scout walker, trying to run the gamut of logs and rocks on your way to the bunker. Moving logs can he shot, but the big piles of them have to be strolled around.

Every-thing is carried out the way you'd expect on an Amiga - sampled speech from the film, pretty graphics... switch off the brain and be prepared for some unsophisticated violent enjoyment. Return of the Jedi is grand while it lasts, but since it's a little superfish (as in superfishul, not as in halibut)  that may not be forever.</desc>

After planning your mission, choosing equipment and healing yourself from your Viceroy mobile base, you must dive into the oceans with your helpful robotic drone RUF and complete a series of 14 missions to save the world. 

There are around 100,000 unique locations to be explored in this 3-D side scrolling game, which is a cross between arcade style action and a role playing game. There are lots of things to explore and experiment with as you travel back to Atlantis. You will meet and question many NPCs throughout the game - talk to them carefully and wisely to gleam key information.</desc>

		<desc>Return to Genesis takes place in the Zephyr system where twelve scientists work on secret projects. Of course every bit of help is appreciated and so every scientist is cloned 50 times for a better productivity. Unfortunately the evil Mechanauts have invaded and the player has the mission to save the scientists and drive the Mechanauts off.

This game is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player's main task is to shoot everything in sight - except the scientists of course, which should be picked up. They also can be shot to win the level, but then the player misses out on extra weapons: every scientist (along with his/her clones) has his own piece of equipment which can be activated at any time as long as the scientist is on board. In contrast to many other games of the genre, contact with the environment does no harm but causes the ship to reverse the flying direction at full speed. All in all there are 50 levels with twelve scientists each.</desc>

		<desc>In the 27th century, centuries of peace have allowed great scientific progress in the development of the first interstellar warp drive. Two research ships, designated Explorer-1 and Explorer-2, are outfitted with experimental drives and sent to find new planets for colonization. Only Explorer-2 returns back to Earth. Refitted as a colony vessel, Explorer-2 is once again ready to embark when the peace is disrupted. A planet-wide rebellion stages a coup and overthrows the government. The Explorer-2, crewed by a loyalist space crew, barely escapes and leaves the solar system. Years later, the Explorer-2 arrives damaged at it's destination and a colony is set up, naming it New Earth. After many generations, the colony is self-sufficient enough to develop a mission: Explore nearby space, research new technologies, harvest resources, develop a space fleet and eventually... reconquer and reunify with the Earth.

Reunion is a strategy game where players must manage the resources and development of a colony. From a central command area, players select from among different menus to control different aspects of the colony. Many of these menus also need the appropriate personnel in charge (commanders), whose skills and price tag vary. Typical menus include: The research screen where specific areas are selected, the production/buy menu which turns resources into goods, the colony building menu where construction can be scheduled and the colony's facilities managed, the galactic map where new planets are chosen for a closer look, and eventually colonization. Players can also consult with their commanders or go to "space local", the nearby bar for all the gossip. In order to produce new material, the player has six different minerals to mine and discover on various planets in the solar system.</desc>

		<desc>Revelation is an abstract puzzle game based around cracking codes on safes. Each of the 80-plus levels is a top-down view of an arrangement of locks and dials, which must be aligned so as to unlock each section by having identical colors touching each other. Not all locks can be moved however, and all of this must be done within a time-limit. Your time to collect the gold (by opening each of the 9 doors in sequence in the hope of finding lots of bling) is limited by how long you took to crack the code. There is a bonus game to unlock, as well as extra lives and special power-ups. A password system ensures that a level need only be cleared once.</desc>

		<desc>You play Rick Dangerous, an Indiana Jones type who's on a quest to find the lost Coolu Amazon tribe. However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base.

Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.

		<desc>Rings of Medusa is a strategy game with light role-playing and business simulation elements. Located in a medieval kingdom, the game puts the player in control of the former king's son. Unfortunately, an evil sorceress called Medusa has taken control of the country and is now dominating the people.

The prince's task is to find five magical rings that will give him the power to overthrow the sorceress and claim back his heritage. In the beginning the hero will try to earn money by doing trade between different towns, or try his luck at bounty hunting or at treasure hunts. Once enough money has been earned to maintain a larger army, the prince will send forth his men to search for the rings which are in the possession of large soldier of fortune armies rallying the lands.

Sometimes the player takes part in small arcade sequences like sword fighting and sea fights, or controls an army on the battle field.</desc>

		<desc>In Ringside you can chart your aspiring fighter's progress from untried stripling to awesome killing machine, well, almost, but you can rise up the world ratings by challenging and beating opponents.

There are a fair selection of punches and tactics. The punches themselves are hardly textbook affairs, nor are they aesthetically executed, but they do seem able to bruise your opponent.

Game has better than average graphics and well defined sprites, but a boxing simulation stands or falls on the flexibility of its play. Standing next to someone and thumping them can get very boring. Ringside is reduced to a fairly static and visually unexciting game. Not even the absurd sequence between rounds where you have to wave a towel over your boxer by fiercely woggling the joystick can alter this.

Ringside can be a good laugh either in the one player or in the two player mode. Then again, no-one gets their nose broken.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2053, and Los Angeles has turned into a grim place ruled by crime and corruption. William 'Blade' Hunter is a private detective who once was a police officer. He is asked to investigate a horrible murder of the mayor's daughter, whose body was mutilated. As Hunter begins to search for clues that would help him solve the crime, he uncovers a conspiracy involving a deadly drug and a powerful criminal syndicate behind it.

Rise of the Dragon is a futuristic first-person adventure game. The game's visuals are reminiscent of a comic book, with digitized photos of actors and hand-painted backgrounds. Unlike most other adventure games of the time, it relies less on inventory puzzles and more on specific choices made by the player. The game has an internal clock and requires the player to plan the protagonist's moves ahead in order to be in the right place at the right time. Dialogues with multiple choices are utilized as a gameplay tool; a wrong choice will often lead to a premature end of the adventure.

There are two side-scrolling action sequences in the game; both can be bypassed without penalty if the player character dies several times in a row. The Sega CD version does not allow the player to skip these sequences. In addition, it uses a different color palette with a greenish tint, and has voice-overs for the dialogues.</desc>

		<desc>Unusually for Electronic Arts in the early 90s, this was a platform -shooter game with little or no adventuring or strategy elements. The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.</desc>

		<desc>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</desc>

		<desc>The awkwardly-titled Robbeary gives you the opportunity of raiding a 24-floor mega-store of its fruity contents. The game opens with the obligatory irrelevant parallax starfield backing the title screen. A short entertaining sample borrowed from a Pet Shop Boys intro is looped continually until you start the game. If you have read between the lines of the scenario you will not be surprised to hear that Robbeary is a traditional platform game. It would seem that this store is an enormous greengrocer's shop, for almost every bit of floor space is occupied by big juicy pieces of fruit. Collect them all from the current screen to get to the next.

Beartle is a very neatly drawn sprite, as are all the enemies. Everything is large and very colourful, no doubt designed with a younger player in mind, the graphics certainly impress. Sound effects during the game are suitably jolly, though it is a shame the title piece never gets anywhere.

Robbeary is definitely one of the better platform games around the Amiga at the moment (1988), and if you have a younger player in mind it would be an ideal choice.</desc>

		<desc>Robozone is a three-part arcade game, divided into a platform section, a 3D maze section and a horizontally-scrolling shoot-'em-up. Now there's nothing inherently wrong with the multiple-subgames style, but each of the three mini games is as thin and dull as the ones found here.

Everyone here has found the platform sequence tedious within 30 seconds, the middle game is simply atrocious, and the last section, a fairly presentable R-Typeish blaster, is unlikely to be reached by anyone other than the most bloody-minded, making it a bit of a waste of time.

The bottom line: excellent in-game music, but a tired, uneventful and repetitive game that more or less completely fails to provide any decent entertainment whatsoever after the neat front end sequence.</desc>

The game screen is laid out much like a Jeopardy board and players take turns at clicking on a square to reveal a multiple choice question. Get it right and you gain points, get it wrong and it's the next players turn. The game ends when at least 3 of the 4 questions in each category have been answered correctly. The questions revolve around Rock music and cover the 1950's-1980's. He who finishes with the most points wins.</desc>

		<desc>In the 1940s, the Nazis built a base on the moon and plan to use a mysterious substance called Lunarium to reduce people's intelligence. However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.

The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.</desc>

		<desc>The “granddaddy” of dungeon hack RPGs, Rogue has a long history that dates back to the 1970's. It was first released as a test application for UNIX, and quickly captured the imagination of popularity among system administrators and computer science students. It was such a popular “test” that enterprising UNIX admins and users distributed it, expanded it, imitated it, and ported it to their home computers.

What is so special about the game that it still attract gamers for over a decade? Many revolutionary features that have become the norm in today's RPGs. Rogue is an  turn-based, single player dungeon crawl. Its attraction lies neither in plot nor puzzles, but in the seemingly endless combinations of features, a wide variety of monsters and loot, and randomly generated dungeon that guarantees infinite replayability. In short, Rogue is to RPGs what Crowther's mainframe Adventure is to adventures: a revolutionary game that spawned a genre.</desc>

		<desc>Rome: Pathway to Power is set - as the name implies - in Ancient Rome. You start life as a poor slave in Herculaneum, which, along with Pompeii, was destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. Eventually you travel to Rome and climb the social ladder, becoming a Captain in the army, a Senator and eventually Emperor of Rome. Four of the game's six levels are adventure style romps, while in the other two levels you control an army in an attempt to conquer an enemy of Rome. 

The game contains many characteristic details to be seen around the levels; from naked people running around the Baths, to buying slaves to fight in the Gladiatorial games. There are instances in which you have the freedom to choose how to deal with various problems.</desc>

Each level is comprised of nine sectors, which are not all linked together. At the beginning of each level you drop in from above and get a general overview of the level. 

Planning a path from sector to sector often involves using moving pathways. The sectors are heavily defended, but weapons can be picked up throughout. When a sector is cleared of robots, the screen flashes and the player is free to move on to the next sector.</desc>

		<desc>Ruff and Reddy have agreed to test Professor Flipnoodles Pocket Rocket. At blast off, something goes terribly wrong and the rocket spins wildly out of control, heading off into deep space.

It crash lands on a planet inhabited by small blue aliens known as Lilli-Punies. Some of these have decided to go exploring on a nearby planet and have become either lost or captured. The Lilli-Punies kidnap Ruff and Reddy and tell them that the only way to regain their freedom is for Ruff to go and rescue all the missing aliens. Without much of a choice the Lilli-Punies take him to the planet where their friends are. Ruff has to search through four areas of the alien planet, beginning on the surface and working his way underground. Each level comprises of various puzzles to solve and varying amounts of Lilli-Punies to find, 20 in all.

Prepare yourself for the wild and wacky adventures that ensue!</desc>

		<desc>Ruffian is a platform adventure played across 17 levels, starring one of the younger videogame characters you’ll see. The game scrolls in multiple directions, although you are mostly progressing vertically, with levels designed so that one slip can see you falling a long way – this is similar to Rainbow Islands, but the levels are considerably longer, and it happens right from level one, making it more significant. Hits with the bad guys cause your percentage of energy to deplete. Each level is time-limited, and you get continues as well as lives. There is an surveillance element to positioning, with characters often camouflaging themselves behind backgrounds, and it being possible to use hills to hide, and get to attack creatures that would otherwise be much tougher foes.</desc>

		<desc>Saint and Greavsie is a sports trivia game where one to four players have to answer sport-related questions. Players start by throwing a ball across a series of stadiums. To the left of these stadiums is a green bar, and the higher the green bar, the greater the distance the ball will go. 

Depending on where the ball lands, the player has to answer three types of questions from one of four question packs. Home questions (worth one point) are generally related to modern football and are the easiest to answer. Away questions (worth two points) are generally related to football in the 1960s and '70s with teasers about 'golden oldies'. Finally, derby questions (worth three points) will test your knowledge of football trivia, and these questions are fun as well as factual. Players can choose to answer the question or pass onto the next player. If the player chooses to answer a question correctly, a penalty shootout is given which involves the player kicking a goal to score bonus points.

The winner of the game is declared after all players have completed 21 or 42 matches (when one league season is completed). The winner is the player who has the most points.</desc>

		<desc>A simple variation of the classic game of Mahjongg (also known as Shanghai). Each of the 40 levels consist of rows and piles of tiles, patterned with symbols such as butterflies and masks. Pair them up within the time limit to move on a level. The difficulty is that a tile can only be moved if it has no tile on top of it, and a gap either to the left or right (or both). Careful planning ahead is required if all tiles are to be cleared.</desc>

		<desc>Level 9's last adventure game features one of the most unique plots and player character ever seen in a game, even though the puzzles are sometimes bordering on the illogical. You are a police man who returns from beyond the grave as a ghost who has to overcome the troubles of ghost-dom together with your ghost friends in order to solve your final case and avenge your own death.

The game is excellent in every respect, the parser is very powerful and rivals Level 9's own Knight Orc in versatility. Non-player characters are quite memorable, especially your ghost friends who will pour out their hearts on you and keep constant company with incessant stories of how they died. Most puzzles involve pleasing those ghosts so they could help you in return, and are largely fun because you have to think like a real ghost to succeed. Overall, Scapeghost is a great but overlooked Level 9 classic that isn't nearly as good as their best games, but is definitely much better than most other IF games.</desc>

		<desc>Scrabble is a licensed version of the popular Spear's game developed by U.S. Gold Ltd. 

Scrabble is a word game for 2 - 4 players. It is played by forming inter-locking words, cross-word style, on a Scrabble playing board. The Scrabble board is a grid on which there are bonus squares, playing a letter on one of these squares doubles or triples the score for either the letter or the entire word. Players have seven letters, or tiles, each and at the end of each turn they take new letters from a pile, unseen, to replace the letters used.</desc>

		<desc>Deep in the Caribbean lies Melee Island, ruled by the governor Elaine Marley. The cruel pirate LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death. As a ghost, he dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. Meanwhile, a young fellow named Guybrush Threepwood is determined to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar he meets three pirates who tell him he has to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. But as Guybrush is trying to complete these tasks, he encounters the lovely governor, and this meeting changes his life forever. Risking to incur the wrath of LeChuck, Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword, and figure out a way to foil the ghost pirate's plans...

The Secret of Monkey Island is a classic adventure game that utilizes the command verb-based SCUMM interface first introduced in Maniac Mansion: the player constructs commands for Guybrush by selecting an appropriate verb and then combining it with an object or an inventory item. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player places a cursor over them. The game is the first LucasArts adventure in which it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck; like in Loom, the player character also cannot die. The branching dialogue system, where the player chooses between several available responses during conversations, allows the player to talk to characters in different ways without fearing a wrong choice, and is often used as a humorous device.

The puzzles are predominantly inventory-based; most of the problems in the game are solved by picking up items and combining them with each other or with objects (or people) in the game world. Several tasks are dialogue-based; among those is the humorous "insult swordfighting", which involves Guybrush learning and choosing witty insults while dueling pirates.</desc>

		<desc>Sensible Golf is a 2D golf simulation.

Having been quite successful with their cute action soccer game Sensible Soccer, Sensible Software decided that the concept of "No fuss, just fun" could be applied to other sports, too. They chose golf.

Sensible Golf is not an accurate simulation of golf, but an action adaptation of the sport streamlined for quick and easy gameplay. Consequently, complications such as wind and terrain heights are not featured, although the green has little arrows indicating the slopes. Apart from that, the player's only concerns are the water and sand hazards, and the distance to the hole. As a result, Sensible Golf is instead a practice in target shooting, rather than a golf game.

Striking involves only two action: Aiming the pointer in the desired direction, and pressing the action button three times. The game uses the well-known three-click-control, with which you set power and swerve of the strike. The computer automatically suggests a proper club, but the player may change it manually. A pop-up map helps one find their bearing. 

The courses are fictional, composed from a pool of holes which often appear in multiple courses, sometimes with minor variations. Play modes include single 18-hole rounds, a complete season and a tournament. Up to 72 human players may participate in the latter.</desc>

		<desc>A "sequel" of sorts to Sensible Software's 1995 Sensible World of Soccer. Based on the teams that played in Euro '96 tournament, SWOS: European Championship Edition sports new features that make the game even more addictive than SWOS, including the ability to pull off looping headers and curved passes, trial players, international management, and more charming cartoony graphics such as animated crowd and goal celebrations. The game itself remains what SWOS is, and more: a very addictive football game featuring tiny players, top-notch feel of the game, and excellent management options (although that is never the focus of this series) to round things off. Anyone who prefers "realistic" players such as motion-captured 3D models of current football games might be disinclined to try the game, but if you are a real fan of the sport, you will recognize after a few minutes how authentic SWOS: ECE feels, despite its cartoony players. You need to dribble the ball for real in this game - it doesn't "stick" to your foot like in FIFA. This, plus a staggering range of moves and shots you can do, make SWOS ECE much more fun than most other football games in the market. Released right before the 1996 European Championship in England, SWOS: ECE was a great PR move by Sensible Software and a superb game to boot. But since everything in the game would be included and surpassed in the 96/97 edition of SWOS , there is little reason to play this game.

		<desc>Undoubtedly the best game in the venerable Sensible Soccer series, Sensible World of Soccer 96/97 is the last annual update by Sensible Software.
SWOS 96/97 basically upgrades the earlier version, SWOS 95/96 Euro '96 Edition, with 1997 teams from around the world. Innovations from the previous version (SWOS 95/96) includes bendy passes, looping headers, more international teams, and even bells & whistles such as crowd animation. The hallmark of the series has been spotless playability and the sheer adrenaline rush of controlling tiny players from a top-down view, and SWOS 96/97 takes the fun to new heights with smoother animations and even more coaching options such as trial players and international management, one of the best new features. International management essentially means that after at least 3 consecutive successful seasons as a club's manager, you can be offered a chance to manage your national team in international tournaments, such as the World Cup or European Championship. You can actually manage any other nation if you don't select a nationality at the start. This feature is a lot of fun, and greatly extends the game's longevity. The career mode also sees some tweaks that make the game longer and more realistic. There are also numerous little additions that make the game a lot more user-friendly, such as flashing the name of a player who has control of the ball on screen, so you can tell the little players apart.
If you love soccer, this is THE soccer game to own. It may not have the realistic ball handling of Dino Dini's Goal! or complex simulation options of Championship Manager, but for sheer playability and joy of on-the-pitch action, SWOS 96/97 is the only game in town.</desc>

In this, the final chapter of the saga, Aarbron has finally regained his human shape but must defeat Maletoth once and for all to become fully human. It did not get as much attention as its predecessors, in spite of the overwhelmingly positive reviews, with most praising the improvements in gameplay and toning down of the difficulty level. Its graphics and sound – though still high quality – were not revolutionary any more in 1992. Beast III had four distinct stages instead of one big area. The game placed less of an emphasis on the action elements so prominent in the first two games, instead preferring a more cerebral approach. The Beast III package did not contain a T-shirt, but rather a badge with a game logo in its place.</desc>

		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories. As the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes his father's face. As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast is a side-scrolling platformer. The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</desc>

		<desc>Using the same graphical interface as Deja Vu, Shadowgate is an adventure game set in a fantasy world. Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However, Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps. 

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at the protagonist suddenly, unexpectedly and, most of all, often. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause the hero to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. If the player character's torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and the player forgets to light a new one, the protagonist will trip in the dark and break his neck.</desc>

		<desc>Operation Wolf and The Untouchables combine for this action game set in 1920s Chicago. You play Lieutenant Sharkey, who has been sent out to wipe out Rubbers Malone and his henchmen.

You have control over the gun, which you move across the screen as the game scrolls steadily from left to right, and must kill as many of the henchmen as you can - otherwise they will shoot at you and reduce your energy level. You are armed with a limited amount of ammo plus a few Molotov Cocktails to throw - both of these can be replenished from bonus items. As well as on the streets, enemies also appear in cars and through windows (there's a special bonus for shooting these). At the end of each level you meet an informant, who must not be shot, as this destroys the entire level of work.</desc>

		<desc>Shuffle is a successor to Atomix and offers the same playing principle: the player has to construct a molecule by combining atoms. Those atoms are spread out over the top-down playfield and can be moved by walking into them with the player character. Once nudged, the atoms don't stop until they meet a wall or another obstacle. All this has to be achieved within a time limit. Also included is the two-player mode known from the predecessor: both players work at the same puzzle, but only the one who finished it gets the points. The players take turns of ten seconds.

The main addition to the gameplay mechanics are power ups which can be collected in the levels, e.g. extra time, bonus points or a level skip. The game features 30 regular levels and all five levels the player has the opportunity to improve the high score by playing a bonus level. In addition there are 35 levels which are designed for advanced players.</desc>

		<desc>Shuttle is a vastly underrated and undersold simulation, probably because it is a “hard” SCI-FI game with a steep learning curve. This is the perfect game for would-be astronauts. It's a very realistic (and the only decent) simulation of the Space Shuttle. This one should not be approached by casual gamers, as this game is rock-hard. The flight model is very good, and it the glide test, the shuttle really handles like the enormous winged brick it is. Avionics are very detailed, and you should get a proper manual to get to use this game effectively.

The manual accurately describes the launch and mission procedures, and unless you happen to work on the space shuttle program, you'll very likely need it. Graphics are very good for the time, sporting good old polygons. Sound is somewhat limited, but decent.

This is a great game that has never really had a sequel, but one really needs to persist with it. Definitively recommended.</desc>

		<desc>Football fever hots up some more as Sierra release their own entry into the computer game World Cup, and it's a very competent and extremely playable arcade soccer game it is one of the most instantly playable arcade football engines yet seen.

Let's begin at the beginning. You can either play as a team in the official World Cup draw, or take part in a random one. Up to eight people can play at once, each selecting a team and playing through their respective groups until victory or rejection. Playing a game is incredibly easy, far easier than the Kick Offs and Sensible Soccers of this world. The reason being that there are none of the combinations and strange joystick positions of those games. Have no fear, as Sierra Soccer is just as addictive and just as much fun. Whether you have an A500 or an A1200, you'll be amazed at the spectacular animation of the players on the pitch. Over 4000 frames of animation have the players running, jumping, sliding, falling face down and there's even a fully mobile referee, complete with working whistle. A1200 owners get the benefit of a full 3D crowd too!

It may not have a big licence behind it, but Sierra Soccer is still great fun to play, and well worth adding to any collection.</desc>

		<desc>Silkworm is a classic horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up. The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you will be on land as well as in the air.

The first player would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joins the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapon's powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game, and a "goose" could appear even during the fight with the end-of-level baddie.</desc>

		<desc>If you've ever suffered through an ant infestation problem or been besieged by the little critters on a family picnic, then SimAnt will probably strike a nerve.

SimAnt at heart is a simple game and doesn't have all the glittery action of adventure and action games but it is, after all, a simulation. What it does have is a great deal of integrity, intrigue and interaction and provides literally hours of immersive game play. The interface, as in most Maxis games, is intuitive and very easy to use. Graphics are what you might expect from an ant simulation, fairly simple in appearance but detailed enough to allow meaningful text, charts and graphs to enhance control. Sound effects are very well done and, in fact, can be toggled off if you don't like the sounds of ant carnage before breakfast.

SimAnt has an amazing amount of strategy involved in managing the survival skills. With a great interface and easy game control system, it's a breeze to play. Various modes offer depth of game play. Replay value depends on how much effort you want to put into managing a virtual ant colony.</desc>

		<desc>The A500/A600/500+ version was released around the same time as Sim Life AGA, the drop in speed was minimal and you was able to create the smaller two worlds. Apart from that, the two games are playing in the same manner.

While earlier Maxis games involved developing ant colonies, buildings or planets, Sim Life is directed at creating and sustaining plants and animals. As in previous Maxis titles, Sim Life features both a macro and micro approach to its subject matter. Not only will you be challenged to build an ecosystem by adjusting such variables as climate, physics, time, and elevation, but you can also create new species by either splicing genes or mixing three different parts from existing animals or plants. Creatures will evolve and mutate over time, interact with others, and may even become extinct due to environmental changes. Choose from six preset scenarios, a built-in tutorial, and an option to play an “experimental” or freeform game.

Sim Life does everything it claims to do, and although it's extremely technical, it never baffles the user with jargon. Its only real downfall is, of course, the fact that only a small percentage of users will fully appreciate what it can do.</desc>

		<desc>The Simulcra unit was thought to be the last best hope for peace. International disputes could be battled out in a simulated environment, in a world with no real guns or bombs. Unfortunately, the system malfunctioned and began generating real weapons and tanks to attack the outside world.

You are the man charged with putting a stop to all of this. In your ground-skimming SRV, remove the power lines that keep Simulcra functional. Shoot out each of the energy projectors which block your path to clear each of the 30 matrices.

The action is viewed from immediately behind you, showing a world of pathways and gaps which rotate as you move your craft, which can also reverse. You will have to fight off guns, planes and everything else the embattled system can throw at you. Destroying these releases pods which give extras such as improved weaponry and extra energy when collected. A full map of the area is provided.</desc>

		<desc>The story is that the Caliph has been turned into a Falcon by his enemies. Now cue Sinbad the super hero with his mission to save the kingdom. Sinbad now assumes command of the armies and navy of Damaron. The answer to most questions can only be found beyond the shores of Damaron. Therefore, you set sail aboard your ship, the Sabarlus, with your loyal crew. Like the legends of Sinbad, you encounter many adventures as you navigate foreign seas in your search for truth. Not all adventures will occur at sea, and when on land you must guard your anchored ship when venturing out. Failure to do so could result in the seizure of ship by sea pirates. As in the legends of Sinbad you must defeat the dreaded Pteranoxos and the Cyclops. You must also find the Gypsy and follow her advice. If you're lucky, the Genie will aid you in your endeavour. And occasionally, you must cross swords with the Black Prince and others.</desc>

		<desc>Normally this type of deep and involved adventure game is just my cup of tea, especially if it is in a 3-D world vein. Sleeping Gods Lie though is an odd game. The puzzles are in there just waiting to be found and the game has considerable depth but to its detriment there is a heck of a lot of wandering around vast, barren terrain as well. The slow moving pace put me off initially but once I got down to some serious mapping it became quite a compelling adventure romp. The accompanying sound effects are surprisingly poor but the title screen music has a certain charm. Sprite expansion is well implemented but I found the character animation and movement occasionally a bit messy to look at. In short, a little long-winded but enjoyable all the same.</desc>

***Smash TV***, known as Super Smash TV on some other versions, is a 1990
arcade game created by Eugene Jarvis and Mark Turmell for Williams. It is
 a run and gun game in the same vein as its predecessor, Robotron: 2084 
(also produced by Jarvis). As in the previous game, players battle waves 
of enemies by using guns; the arcade version even uses the two-joystick 
control system of Robotron. The plot of Smash TV revolves around a 
futuristic game show in which players compete for various prizes, as 
well as their lives.
















Home versions were developed for various platforms, most of which were 
published by Acclaim Entertainment.
















***Gameplay***
















The play mechanic is very similar to that of Eugene Jarvis' earlier 
Robotron: 2084, with dual-joystick controls and series of single screen 
areas. The theme of the game, borrowed from The Running Man, involves 
players competing in a violent game show, set in the then future year of 
1999. Moving from one room to the next within the studio/arena, players 
have to shoot down hordes of enemies as they advance from all sides, 
while at the same time collecting weapons, power-up items, and 
assorted bonus prizes until a final show down with the show's host 
where players are finally granted their prizes, life and freedom. 
Among the game's items are keys – if enough keys are collected, 
players can access a bonus level called the Pleasure Dome.

		<desc>If there was ever a game that could win an award for being the most sponsored in the software industry, this would have to be it. Not only is The Sun newspaper behind it, but so are Fizzy Chewits and Domino Pizzas. It's a shame they had to sponsor such a terrible game. No, scratch that, Snapperazzi is staggeringly terrible.

You play the Snapper, a small but willing photographer who wants to get into the world of the paparazzi. To prove his worth to The Sun editor, he has to race around some large, jerky levels, taking pictures of some of the most misshapen sprites ever seen, while collecting rolls of film and trying to avoid bills, shops and anything else that might try to takes his money. He also needs to collect enough delicious Domino pizzas, so he can then build a space ship to take him to the next level.

I'm sorry, but this is really a dreadful game. The joystick controls are sticky and wooden feeling, the sound effects are drab and basic, and the garish use of background colours gives the game a very confused look. I can't think of anything positive about this game at all. Even the box front looks like it was thrown together in the dark.</desc>

		<desc>A conversion of the cult fave arcade rave. It's effectively Bubble Bobbie in a snowy clime but with a few appropriate twists and some neat cartoon visuals. It looks and plays identically to its arcade parent - well, save for the absence of the simultaneous two player option (it wasn't implemented because the action would have slowed down from the ideal running speed). Although scheduled for release in mid-1991 and completed, the Amiga conversion was never published. Later, the game was rediscovered and released for free.</desc>

		<desc>You must fly an F14-LBC "Rapier" on a series of missions all along Colombia. You've land missions like free flight, destroy drug labs, bomb drug refineries, destroy drug stores and destroy drug convoy. You've aircraft carrier missions like free flight, destroy enemy aircraft carriers, destroy drug ships and destroy enemy oil supplies. In the air you can fight the MiG-27, Su-27, MiG-29 and MiG-31 armed with heat or radar guided missiles!

You can choose to be an existing pilot or to create a new one. You can choose between 2 levels of difficulty: beginner (less enemy attacks) or expert (the most dangerous). The weather will affect the mission. The good weather will be great for training, and the stormy will be dangerous but great for attacks, as you can hide into the clouds and approach the enemy unnoticed. You'll have a copilot that will help you telling what's going on every moment. You can avoid missiles using your skills, using chaff or... if you can't, you can use your parachute!</desc>

		<desc>SOLID GOLD is a freeware (in electronic form) Jump'n Run with 8-way soft scrolling. It's written for the classic Amiga hardware and designed in the style of the early 90s.

You are John Kayle, an adventurer and archeologist, trying to recover important artefacts in four different places of the world, competing with a mysterious secret society.

The game features ten levels spanning four worlds, with different graphics and enemies. Each level's goal is to find an artefact which will lead the  way to the next world. Most enemies can be killed by jumping onto them. It is important to hit them from above. Touching an enemy's side or contact from below are lethal for the hero. After collecting 50 gems of any kind you will be granted an extra life. Each level is concluded by a statistics screen. It will display the number of collected items and killed enemies, opposed to total numbers. Upon reaching the maximum possible numbers, an extra bonus is granted.</desc>

		<desc>Son Shu Shi is a game that nearly never was. Although released on the Atari ST, the Amiga version was previewed and reviewed in magazines but never appeared. The authors completed the Amiga version, but no longer have a copy of the source code or binary. However, a friend had still retained a working version.

The evil demon Taar-Ka has occupied the lovely kingdom of Tan Tao, which is why Son Shu-Shi is now allowed to act as a savior in the emergency. Technically very well balanced game, very colourful with beautiful background. The sound effects are clear and crisp and music is everywhere.

This is a brilliant platformer. Gameplay is no slouch and helps to make it thoroughly entertaining with fast and frantic playability. So beautiful and very addictive. Now I  need “one more go”.</desc>

		<desc>Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of tactical warfare.

The evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to overrun the peaceful country of Galanor. The alliance of races in Galanor isn't very fond of suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war -- it's your job to coordinate the Galanorian defense.

Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics for army leaders. Despite the game's title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in battles and not under your direct control.

The game contains a time limit; you've got 40 turns in easy level, less in advanced levels.</desc>

		<desc>Actual Screenshots' game, Sorceror's Apprentice, places you in the part of wisened old man blessed with the King's magic powers. The reason for this gilt is because the King wants you to free the land from the forces of darkness.

I must admit to finding the gameplay of Sorceror's Apprentice somewhat tiresome and monotonous albeit playable. The first few credits kept me addicted so that I could progress to allow me to see later levels, but I soon saw it was a case of “seen it, done it”. The graphics are far superior to the sound, although I still wasn't satisfied with what should be up to sixteen-bit standard.

In terms of graphics, Sprites are nicely drawn that jump and move fairly smoothly across bland and simplistic backdrops. The explosions are rather poor, and the overall effect is polished but could be hotter. Sounds are slightly worst than the graphics, as there is nothing to write home about.

Overall, a great disappointment that is best avoided.</desc>

		<desc>2039 A.D. Man begins deep space exploration in search of new life forms and usable fuel sources. What he discovers is trouble.

Until now, the success of past explorations was causing the space effort to grow by leaps and bounds. Until now, the explorers had found little more than fungus and small insects as alternative lifeforms. Until now, the chief dangers had been those posed by the hostile environment of space. Until now, the aliens had not known about THEM.

On the ragged edge of the galaxy, other creatures that roam the stars discover humans and spaceships to be excellent sources of food and other resources. Prepared at the worst for clashes with rival exploration teams, the human crews can do little to defend themselves as wave upon wave of nightmare creatures descend upon their ships and bases.

In response to their distress calls, the Federation has assembled a series of rescue teams, lead by their best military sharpshooters, to deal with the alien menace. As the leader of one of these teams, you must gun down the intruders and pick up the human survivors. Brave the maze of dark corridors that may lead to a deadly shootout between you and legions of monsters. Pick up survivors and extra ammo on the way.</desc>

		<desc>All over the globe, factories are falling into ruin, economies have fallen apart, interest rates are rising, the TV companies are out of business and (worst of all) milk production has come to a standstill. No more Shredded Wheat for you, mate. So what's behind all this? A band of deadly, virus-like aliens which have infected every part of the planet with their horrible disease, that's what. Pretty nasty, huh? So absolutely, horrendously nasty, in fact, that the combined efforts of the army, the navy, the air force, the fire service, the police, Machomen and Postman Pat have been totally liquidised in their attempt to stop it.

Just when you thought that the end of the world was nigh, when everybody thought it was OK to eat lots of cream cakes 'cos they were gonna die tomorrow anyway, a little speck became visible in the sky. Was it a bird? Was it a helicopter? Was it a speck of chocolate on your glasses? Nope, da da daaaaaa – it was Space Harrier. Yeaaah!

With nothing but a laser and a jetpack to his name, he battles through waves of ugly looking aliens, dodges dangerous missiles, survives end-of-level tussles with great, big enormous fire-breathing dragons, tries to stop himself from splatting, slap bang into the nearest obstacles, get his eyebrows singed and still survives.
Some selfless guy, huh? Not really. He just couldn't face another day without three Shredded Wheat.</desc>

		<desc>Six years after its first appearance, the classic sci-fi send-up is back with a vengeance. Equipped with an all-mouse game system, and shrill Nineties graphics is sets out to enrapture the next generation of players.

Prepare to save the world, well Xenon, our hero's home planet, as Roger Wilco tumbles into The Sarien Encounter. Inconveniently for Roger - he's in the middle of a nap - the universe has chosen this exact moment to begin falling apart. No more sleep for Roger.

Full to the brim with Hitchhiker-type humour, it puts the threadbare fabric of recent adventures to shame. It should be an integral part of every ambitious collection, if you have an A3000. Everyone else will be sorely tired by long loading sessions, slow animation and gritty graphics. Sci-fi fanatics must play it, others still can, though Sierra should do their homework and deliver versions that are as much fun on a standard Amiga because they deserve to remain classics.</desc>

		<desc>Following his humorous adventures in previous game, Roger Wilco is relaxing at his favorite pub somewhere in time and space when heavily armed soldiers enter the room. Carrying a parting message from Roger's old nemesis, Sludge Vohaul, they plan to get rid of the janitorial hero, execution style. That is, until a man with an over-sized hair dryer helps Roger escape through a time rip into the future. Now Roger Wilco has woken up on his home planet, some time in a meta-fictional Space Quest XII. It is a grim, dystopian future: the series has gone to ruin without its hero, and Vohaul rules supreme. Roger must find a way to avoid Vohaul's henchmen, fulfill his destiny, and learn about a few surprises that await him in his own future.

Space Quest IV is the first in the Space Quest series to feature Sierra's icon-based SCI interface and 256-color graphics. The command set includes icons for walking, looking, using or taking, talking, smelling, tasting, as well as inventory access. Roger Wilco is shown on the screen from the exterior in multiple viewpoints. Like in the previous games, inventory-based puzzle-solving co-exists with timed tasks and various hazards that will kill Roger if the player is not careful.</desc>

		<desc>Space Ranger takes the Defender theme, and developes it into a far superior game. A multitude of highly imaginative, friendly looking critters (as they are called), innocently go about their daily business. Most are ground-based, and run up and down or leap into the air. Others swoop around the sky, merrily tweeting and quacking. All this is set against a three speed paralax scrolling background of mountains and forests.

But here come no-good aliens to put a downer on things. A mother ship hovers in wait for any unsuspecting critters to wander beneath it. It then turns on a tractor beam which pulls them into the craft. A well aimed shot will kill these, freeing the poor little cubes. On the other hand, a poorly aimed shower of laser fire could easily result in a critter being shot.

Space Ranger's appeal is mainly in its cuteness. The effective backgrounds make the game a pleasure to watch. Defender variants are nothing new, but this is the best I've seen. Space Ranger is also fun to play, and whilst not stunning, is an example to be followed by other budget companies. Definitely one of the best cheapies around. Highly recommended.</desc>

		<desc>Special Forces is a top-down arcade shooting game with a dash of strategy. It is the sequel to Airborne Ranger.

When times are rough, the American people rely on their army. And when times are rough, the American army relies on their special forces. A small group of highly trained, superbly skilled, well-armed and clean-shaven elite soldiers boldly go where no man has gone before. At least no honest man.

Special Forces let's you control a team of four in a top-down view and setting reminiscent of Jagged Alliance, only that the time ticks continuously. Consequently, strategy and stealth stand back behind Gauntlet-style arcade action. Moving alone or in squad formation, you shoot enemy soldiers and blow up bunkers, always quick to go in and quicker yet to go out. Goals vary from deploying laser targeting systems for air strikes to assassinations to rescue missions; some assignments take place under cover of darkness, with night vision systems coloring the landscape a gloomy green.

16 missions take you to four different parts of the world, from the terrorist's arctic ice to the drug cartel's native jungle. Before hopping into the helicopter, you may choose four soldiers out of eight, each with different special abilities, and equip each one. Reading the text briefings is crucial, as the game won't warn you if you go on a bombing raid without any explosives. Also, the higher the difficulty level you choose, the less accurate is the info that you get on your targets, so you'll have to search the area. Luckily, a detailed map provides an overview. As enemies respawn and ammo depletes, some men may not make it back. Those who do can be awarded medals and promotions, which will boost their morale and increase their stats.</desc>

		<desc>You play a real high-flying marine asked to save four famous harbours from enemy forces using just a speedboat and a few missiles.

Viewed from above and behind, like the perspective of a racing game, the boat has to be steered between two lines of mines for the first part of each harbour. Then, with missiles, you must destroy enemy boats and the four communication towers which control them. Later, a helicopter increases your abilities with rocket launchers, speed, maneuverability and smart bombs.

The main sprite isn't bad but the horizon graphics and other sprites are simple and jerky in comparison. At least the water's silly stripes move smoothly. The Amiga version's playable, so you shouldn't have too much trouble reaching the weak shooting sections. This game is not recommended.</desc>

		<desc>Spellbound Dizzy is by far the best escapade the little egg has had. With colourful graphics and the usual Dizzy gameplay.

It's not really worth relating the plot, suffice it to say that our Diz has to save the Yolkfolk from the standard terrible fate. Along the way he has to collect and manipulate various objects, while communicating with certain other characters.

It doesn't push the Amiga to its limits, and neither is it astounding in terms of
originality, but the unique charm of CodeMasters' cartoon hero is undeniable. Perhaps the game's only flaw is that there's a little too much wandering back and forth.

It's not a classic by any means, but you'd be as mad as a March Hare if you haven't at least looked at it yet.</desc>

		<desc>Spherical Worlds is a multi-directional shoot 'em up in the vein of Alien Breed where players control a small spherical droid which needs to destroy enemy robots on a space station. Each level is won by navigating the maze correctly and reaching the exit, sometimes requiring keys that need to be collected.

The droid has both a set amount of extra lives and a health bar, which is reduced by touching other robots. There is one main weapon (which can overheat) and a secondary weapon with limited ammo. At the end of each level, weapon upgrades can be bought in a shop.

The most important aspect of gameplay is that the droid can easily fall off edges or through holes. Different terrains have effects on the acceleration and friction of the droid, so the player has to carefully navigate the levels.</desc>

		<desc>This game is based on the long-running British satirical television show with puppet likenesses of political figures and celebrities. A prophet determines that a world war will occur in seven years instigated by a mysterious leader. To avoid this, one ruler of the world must be determined in this beat 'em up involving six rulers: U.S.A.'s Ronald Regan, the U.K.'s Margaret Thatcher, the USSR's Mikhail Gorbachev, South Africa's PW Botha, Iran's Ayathollah Khomeini, and Pope John Paul II. 

Having chosen which to play as, you travel to an opponent's country to engage in a best-of-three fight that is judged by Queen Elizabeth II on a postage stamp. You attack each opponent on the ground as well as jumping in the air and each character has a special move like Thatcher's head-butt or Khomeini's beard whip. You can also call for help twice from an aide who will usually throw a projectile at your opponent. If you manage to defeat all 5 opponents, you will meet the mysterious leader in a final showdown in a mud-wrestling pit in the dark where you will only be able to see the eyes of the characters. You can also play 2-player fights, one against another on the same computer.</desc>

		<desc>Eoliae is a remote land where myth meets truth, and where winds shows only the power of gods moving armies from front to front, while diplomacy is still 'hanging' in the air full of crossing winds. The chaos was born as the Great master was murdered, and evil Sharkaan is threatening all of the Eoliae land. You must learn the power of the winds, gain the knowledge for trade and diplomacy, build windmills and strike your enemy where it hurts the most. Only try doing that and stay alive.</desc>

		<desc>Hard is not the word for it. You're harder than very hard, you're even harder than the hardest that ever... erm... was really hard. You're so hard, in fact, that you've decided to prove it to the rest of the world. The meanest, nastiest, vilest street fighters of five different nations have agreed to take you on in one of the dirtiest, most underhand, no-holds-barred street fighting contests in the universe ever.

If this is a top-quality beat 'em up then I'm a one-eyed Romanian greengrocer. Talk about easy - you don't even need to study the moves to be able to knock practically everyone out in under an minute. I got right through to the last toughie on my first go – which doesn't exactly say much for the product's lastability. I can't say I was overly impressed by the graphics, the sound or the slow-motion gameplay – in fact I can't say I was overly impressed by anything at all. Even the bonus section takes ages to react to your frantic pushing of the joystick – by which time your energy bar has gone back down to minimum. If you're after a beat 'em up leave this one lying on the shelf.</desc>

		<desc>SR2 is primarily a racing game, with an interesting premise. You buy and race “muscle cars” in the 1960s. Except, these are not professional races. Instead, you challenge drivers at the local burger joint for illegal races down Mullholland drive.

I knew the magazine reviews had said quality was average, but still a decent game. It turned out to be much better than I thought it would be. Lots of emphasis is placed on upgrading your car. You have to spend your money wisely, and pick the best parts for the money. Once your car has been upgraded and modified, you drive it down to the local burger and fries joint. There, you will find a variety of other muscle cars, you can ask to look at their engine, and challenge them to a race. They may even challenge you to a race. Only drivers with cars similar or better will agree to a race. Naturally, as the game goes on, the races go for more money, and some challengers will only race for pink slips, and the game becomes serious. Obviously, losing a race at this level means the game is over.

Driving simulation part was terrible. It was slow, and the graphics were poor. It reminded me of running “test drive” on an old 8086 PC. Overall, good concept. I find it strange that the “driving” section was so terrible. However, the “upgrade” and “challenge” sections are well made, and easy to navigate and use. Not recommended unless you like working on cars.</desc>

		<desc>Street Rod is a car racing game with a difference - and loads of atmosphere as well. It's set in the days when cars were really cars and milk bars were really milk bars. First you'll have to buy your car - look through the classified ads in the newspaper on the screen. Then get to work in the body-shop - maybe a new paint job in something tasteful like hot pink. Then it's out with the engine. A workshop screen lets you pull it to pieces, make timing adjustments and add high performance parts.

Then it's off to the race track. A cruise down the main street to show off your wheels will always result in a challenge - and usually there's a little wager on the side. The race sequences are difficult, and you only get one chance. Crash your car and it's back to the body repair shop. Not only that, your bank balance drops alarmingly. You can use joystick or mouse controls - I'm still not sure which I like best, but I suspect the joystick gives the best “feel”.

Graphics are very nice, music is atmospheric - all in all, Street Rod is a hot game.</desc>

***Strider II*** (released in North America under the title of Journey 
from Darkness: Strider Returns), is a side-scrolling platform game 
published by U.S. Gold (under license from Capcom USA) and originally 
released for various computer platforms in 1990. It is a 
European-developed sequel to Capcom's arcade game Strider, which 
U.S. Gold previously ported to home computers in Europe. The game 
was developed by Tiertex, as with Human Killing Machine, the U.S. Gold  
sequel to Street Fighter.
















Strider II was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, 
Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Strider II was later 
remade for the Mega Drive and Master System in 1992.
















In the computer versions of Strider II the objective of the game is to 
rescue the Princess of Planet Magenta from a terrorist group that are 
keeping her captive. The controls in the computer version are similar 
to U.S. Gold's home computer ports of the original Strider, although 
the character cannot slide nor climb ceilings like in the original 
game. However, he can still climb walls, as well as ropes. In addition 
to his cypher, he can also use a rifle whenever he is still standing 
still. If the player has collected enough energy icons throughout each 
stage, they transform into a wheeled robot when confronting the boss 
at the end of each stage. As a robot, the Strider can shoot lasers, 
but cannot jump nor crouch. His robot form has a separate energy gauge 
from his regular energy gauge as a human. When his robot gauge runs 
out, he will transform back to a human. The game consists of five 
stages.

		<desc>One of the best M.U.L.E. clones ever made, Subtrade: Return to Irata transfers the galactic capitalism of Dani Bunten's timeless classic to an undersea economy.

Despite new species, background graphics, and different commodities, gameplay is still M.U.L.E. at its heart: up to four players vie in a cutthroat competition to be the richest businessman in a futuristic economy. The different phases of M.U.L.E., e.g. land grant, production, and marketing, are preserved intact and are greatly enhanced by intuitive mouse-based interface and 16-bit graphics. The auction interface, which is the best part of M.U.L.E., is still as furious and fun as ever, with computer players that are aggressive enough to pose a real challenge. Unlike Linel's Traders, another M.U.L.E. clone, Subtrade does not introduce new gameplay options or the number of commodities.

Overall, Subtrade is definitely one of the best M.U.L.E. clones, if not THE best. M.U.L.E. fans will definitely enjoy this one, although the disappointing lack of tournament mode means that an average game with 4 players can be finished in less than 1-2 hours.</desc>

		<desc>Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. 

With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).</desc>

***Super Cars*** is a top-view racing game from Gremlin Interactive, 
who later produced the Lotus series of games. Stylistically, the game 
is influenced by Super Sprint.




There are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be 
raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder 
than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on temporary 
handling and power upgrades, plus armour plating and front/rear shooting 
missiles that can knock out other racers. The player must finish in the 
top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer 
opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game.




The car can be upgraded throughout the game via the shop section. The 
player is given an initial price, but also a number of options of things 
to say to the salesman - with the right combination, the price will 
drop.




An unusual easter egg was featured in the game, whereby typing in a 
certain swear word in the name screen will reset the game.

		<desc>Superfrog is a traditional jump & run platformer. You’re – surprise – a frog. Your enemies are all animals – like bees, hedgehogs or snails. You have no weapons. The only way to kill the enemies is to jump on them. Every stage has a time limit. In this limit you have to collect a pre-determined number of coins. Each of the six worlds has four stages. Every stage has a password. After all you can type your name into a high score table.</desc>

		<desc>Take control of an expansion team in the SportTime Hockey League and play to win the ultimate prize.
Surprisingly sophisticated not only for its time, but to this day, this classic title features many options missing in modern hockey video games.
Features include:
- customize the league to your liking: season length, period length, playoff series length
- name your team & choose which division to play in
- choose your team colours
- create your players (last name, distribute off/def skill points)
- manage your team including setting lines
- make trades or send your players to training camp to improve their stats
- play as coach and pick which lines take the ice, and what strategies they use
- play as center or goalie, or you can coach only and watch the AI battle it out.
- two player same team co-op (center & goalie positions only)
- strive to improve your team stats as your career spans multiple seasons
- toggle the size of the puck by pressing 'p' on systems with sufficient RAM

Will you tank for last place to earn more player improvement points?
Or will you create your own rookies and watch as they progress through multiple seasons?

With Superstar Ice Hockey, you can play it your way!</desc>

		<desc>Like so many brave men before him, Prince Clumsy has been lured into a tough adventure to save the woman of his dreams. The route to the castle in which her ugly sister has imprisoned her is treacherous and goes both indoors and out. You're armed with a dagger to face the many henchmen infesting the areas. Bread and ale can be collected to restore your health, and there are lots of points bonuses on offer. Less pleasant are the super glue, ball & chain (ironic given that he's chasing a potential wife) and poison.</desc>

You can play a full season of tournaments, with world rankings updated as you go. Singles and doubles matches are on offer, and their lengths are variable. A full ball-machine training mode is offered, which allows you to face a succession of shots, with a choice of shot styles and speeds to allow you to hone problem areas of your game. Two player matches can also be played, and mouse or joystick control are supported.</desc>

***Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles***, released as Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles: Super Kame Ninja in Japan and ***Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles*** 
in Europe, is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up released by Konami as a 
coin-operated video game in 1989. It is based on the first Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series which began airing in the winter 
of 1987. The original coin-operated game was distributed to the arcades 
in two variants: a standard 2-player version that allowed either player 
to choose their character and a deluxe 4-player version with each player 
controlling a different character. Home versions of the game were 
released for various platforms.
















The computer ports of the arcade game were released by Image Works and 
ported by Probe Software in 1991 for the ZX Spectrum, Amiga, 
Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, PC and Commodore 64. The title was changed to 
Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: The Coin Op in the European versions 
(Hero being the re-branding of the license in Europe due to censorship 
issues) and lacked the extra stages and bosses from the NES game.

***Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles***, originally released as Fierce Turtle 
Ninja Legend in Japan and later as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles in Europe,
is a 1989 platform game for the Famicom/NES. The game was released in 
Japan through Konami themselves, then in North America through Konami's 
Ultra Games imprint, followed by a release through the European equivalent
, Palcom Software, in PAL regions.
















This was the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video game, and is based 
on the 1987 TV series, which was in its third season at the time of the 
game's original release, although the art style more resembles the 
original TMNT comic series.
















The game was ported to various home computer platforms in 1990, including
the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amiga. The DOS version is
infamous, as it contains a gap that is impossible to cross without 
cheating.

		<desc>This is an arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance.

Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day, renamed T2: The Arcade Game for home conversions, features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).</desc>

		<desc>Terry's Big Adventure looks and feels somewhat similar to Mario's, being a side-scrolling platform game using stylised block graphics and lots of ledges to climb up and around. Terry is armed with a yo-yo which can be directed as a weapon by pushing the joystick as you hold down fire - an idea later repeated by Trolls. On this occasion the use of the yo-yo causes Terry to recoil slightly, so be careful that this does not push him off a ledge or into the path of another enemy.

There are 12 levels in total, incorporating many rivers to cross as well as hordes of hedgehogs, snails and similar to kill. Hidden bonus objects and time extensions can be found. When you start a new game you start form the last level you reached, so you effectively have unlimited continues.</desc>

		<desc>The Third Courier is set in the era of the 'cold war', and the action takes place in Germany. The player is an American spy, and his mission is to recover stolen NATO defense plans.

You start off in your apartment, which contains a computer, bugging equipment and an answerphone, as well as useful items such as money and a passport. A compass on screen is used to move around, with symbols appearing on the left and right of the status screen to indicate when something important is to the west or east of you. 

You will have to explore the city streets, with the aid of taxis and the Autobahn. Talk to important people and buy key objects, and then sneak around spying on anyone who seems suspicious. Encounters with enemy agents, muggers and tramps can turn violent; when they do, use your gun quickly to ensure they are shot first.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the Avalon Hill boardgame, Third Reich lets you play not only as Hitler and his staff, but also as the allied powers. The scenario is limited to the European theatre.

The game is played in rounds of three months, split into several phases such as declaration of war, movement, battle and construction.

You begin the game by declaring war. Which front you open up first will determine the further development of the war. Warring nations are split into two kinds – great military powers such as the allies and the axis, and neutral states.

One resource to be househeld with is your gross national product. This is the resource that will be expended when you build up your armies, and eventually send them to war.

The game has a multitude of scenarios, each with its own goals; just killing your enemy is not the best way to win, if at all.

Just as in the board game, the action takes place on a hexagon map of Europe.</desc>

		<desc>This license of the children's TV show set it as a Ghosts 'N Goblins-style hack-n-slash adventure. The Thundercat must defeat Mumm-Ra's forces, which range from dwarves to bats. Although you start with only a sword, more can be collected by attacking the various containers through the levels - later weapons can destroy these enemies quicker, and allow attacks from a distance. Reaching the end of each level sees bonuses for time and kills. The path through the game can be varied on later levels, so you can play it through more than once and find new sections, even though the individual levels only scroll left-to-right.</desc>

		<desc>Thunderstrike is a 3d spaceship shooter set in the year 2238, using a non-textured polygon graphics engine. As a pilot in the "Ground Defense Games", you must make your way through several arenas built on different planets. You can choose from four different ships, each with different properties (better/worse acceleration, top speed, or turning speed).

When you enter the arena, you are given several pyramids that you must defend from robotic drones sent out to collapse them. In addition to defending your pyramids, you must destroy the spawning centers that spawn not only drones, but an array of robotic fighters to hunt you down.

When you destroy a fighter, sometimes it will leave behind an upgrade pod (shield, turbo, power, or twin-fire). There are also tracks that you can latch your ship onto to travel the perimeter of the arena quickly.

At the end of each round, your performance is reviewed, and if you did good, your ship is upgraded and you move on to the next round.</desc>

		<desc>This tennis simulation uses a top-down scrolling perspective. You are not in control of the player's motion, but once he gets close to the ball, shot selection is down to you. Standard shots plus topspin, lobs and stop volleys are available, by pushing the joystick in the right direction as you aim the shot.

The game supports up to 16 players in singles matches on a variety of court surfaces. It includes all of the major world tournaments - the four Grand Slam events at Melbourne, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and New York, plus the Davis Cup and Masters events. An early attempt at TV-style coverage is offered.</desc>

		<desc>Tiger Road is a beat 'em up in which you (as Lee Wong) must rescue the village children from the evil Ryo Ken Oh. Many levels are horizontally scrolling, although with high ledges to jump onto and follow for a slightly different path. Magic urns containing improved weapons appear frequently. Most enemies are easy to attack and only need one hit to kill, although they come at you in large hordes. Once you get to the indoor sections you will find big enemies with the ability to kill you with one hit, in sections set on multiple levels complete with stairways.</desc>

		<desc>The game is a strategical puzzle action, where you have to eliminate the playfield filling it with the tiles of different colors until the time will be exhausted. Each playfield represents a certain period of the human evolution such as Prehistory, Crusades, Prohibition or Berlin Wall. On each level some animation takes place, and you should perform your goal until it logically finishes.

The tiles are triangles of different colors, sometimes combined in groups, appear in one corner of the playfield and should be put in another place based on the player's strategy in the way to do not block the path for other tiles. When four triangle tiles with adjacent tiles of different colors formed a square, this square will be eliminated from playfield with its part and no tiles may be placed or moved here. Adjacent tiles of the same colors will be eliminated from playfield, but playfield will remain untouched. Tiles may be moved on the playfield and rotated over the center of the square. Also playfield may include different obstacles, which may influence on moving/rotation of your tiles to make it more difficult, and they should be avoided in any possible way.

Finishing the level will give you the code, which may be used later to access this level. There are 30 levels available to play.</desc>

		<desc>Time Scanner is a pinball game. As usual, the goal is to keep the ball in the game by bouncing it back with the paddles. Hitting bumpers and other obstacles rewards points and completing a table requires mastering certain objectives which depend on the table on hand. Every table is divided into two parts with their own paddles: the game only scrolls if the ball goes down. The four tables are:

- Volcano: The winning condition is to spell the table's name by using the associated volcano lanes.
- Ruins: In the middle of the table there is a "collect ball" hole. If all targets were hit and two balls were collected in the hole, a special fire ball is set loose. The stage is won when bringing this ball into the hole.
- Saqqarah: This pyramid themed table also required spelling a name by knocking down targets and hitting a special hole.
- The last table introduces Breakout elements: the player needs to hit blocks to vaporize them.

The first three tables can be freely selected and the last one is unlocked by beating the other three.</desc>

Each one of them is guarded by one of Gylend's henchmen, but to get to them, you must fight off other enemies that are specific to each time era. Some of these enemies will drop weapons that you can pick up and use. You can use several teleports scattered in each time era to travel to another.</desc>

		<desc>The Kingdom of Albereth was under attack of barbarian forces. King Valwyn drove the barbarians away, but was wounded in battles. Searching for a place where he could rest and restore his strength, he left the city - but never returned. Now, a new hero must rise and defend his homeland.

Times of Lore is an action game with light role-playing elements, which follows the adventures of a young warrior (strong barbarian, armored knight, or quick valkyrie) to assist a weakened kingdom from various threats, and to recover special Artifacts that once made the kingdom strong.

Gameplay consists of moving the protagonist in real-time (day and night) through various terrains, like forests, towns, and dungeons. The player character gathers basic items, like health and magic potions, and increasingly powerful weapons as he completes tasks and advances the plot. Conversations are handled through key phrases. Battles involve a few types of creatures (skeletons, orcs, rogues) of which there can be various flavors.</desc>

		<desc>7-year-old Tom and his mother are visiting the old castle in Scotland, while evil sorcerer kidnapped the mother. Tom was very upset, but the brave ghost Sir Reginald Arrow appears to help Tom. Evil sorcerer kidnapped his beloved 500 years ago to sacrifice her for Lucifer. Tom's mother may become the last victim in the sequence of dark ritual, and Sir Arrow has only 24 hours to stop the ritual and free Tom's mother. 

In the game you are controlling Sir Arrow. He may walk; jump; duck; use weapon; collect, combine and use items. Tom is near, but he should be kept in good mood. He may help you to beat monsters, but his energy is exhausting and he should be fed with Hamburgers and Milkshakes. When he is upset, you should give him a Teddy Bear. All such items as well as many others required to progress in the game such as different weapons, magic harp, or lighter, etc. are scattered within the castle. The huge doors either keep bonus items increasing your score, or monsters, or clues to solve the riddles. Tom may walk on his own, and you should blow in whistle to call him back and do not loose him. 

Many enemies are trying to get your life energy out, so kill or avoid them. Do not loose Tom, keep an eye on his stats, and do not allow to scare him to death. Just find his mother, and revenge for all the victims.</desc>

		<desc>This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver).

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.

You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.</desc>

		<desc>Top Secret is a platform game played out on individual screens, each with a number of disks to collect. There are various enemies on the screen, which must be hit a number of times to be stopped. The ground-based creatures can then be walked over for points, while the birds simply stop for a few seconds. Your weapons have an arc similar to Kid Gloves, meaning that they hit the ground then rebound to a lower height, making precision aiming important. 

The level layouts are similar to Rodland, with gaps between platforms, and your character glides in a similar way - some of the disks are suspended in mid-air, and you must control the character's fall to pass over these - thankfully your character isn't harmed by falling. A number of bonus items are on offer, including extra points, extra lives and invincibility.</desc>

So of course the next course of action is to travel through five levels while killing all of the necromancer's creatures on the way, including an especially nasty one at each level's end. 

The levels are generally side-scrolling, but sometimes underground passages can be reached via holes. This has no significant effect, though. The gameplay consists of using the four melee weapons which three moves each to get rid of the enemies without dying from their hits. Helpful power ups can be found when destroying parts of the scenery. Besides health refreshments and invincibility, there are also permanent upgrades for Torvak available, e.g. an extended health bar, greater speed or magical enchantments for the weapons. When an upgraded weapon is equipped, a powerful spell can be unleashed by holding the fire button.</desc>

		<desc>Doug Quaid is a mild-mannered construction worker with a gorgeous wife in an apartment on futuristic Earth. Plagued by restless feelings and dreams of Mars, he heads to Rekall, Inc. to purchase a commercial memory implant of a Martian vacation 'cheaper, better, and safer than the real thing'. However, the implant procedure uncovers latent memories of Quaid's real life as a secret agent for the Martian government. Pursued relentlessly by his former employers, Quaid must fight from Earth to Mars in a battle to reclaim his past and secure his future.

Total Recall for the Amiga and has players controlling Quaid as he fights through seven levels on Earth and Mars. The game alternates between platforming levels and driving levels. Platforming levels require Quaid to fight guards and find the exit. The player may duck to avoid bullets and fight back with both captured weapons and meaty Schwarzenegger fists. The first level requires the player to locate items to open the exit, and a later level has the player switching control between Quaid and resistance fighter Melina to solve a puzzle.

Driving levels are high-speed side-scrolling runs, with the player's vehicle moving at a fixed speed. The player must dodge passing traffic, or blow them apart with weapons. If they survive to the end, they must defeat a mobile boss vehicle to end the level. Cutscenes appear between certain levels that tell the plot of the movie and set up the next scene.</desc>

		<desc>The hero's name is Jeremy Flynn. He is a pirate around 1641, who while he has some problems with his compass, he and his crew get near an island (devil's island), where seems to be Redbeard (a bad guy) with his crew. In a night attack, Redbeard's men steal ship's resources and kidnap Jeremy's crew. It seems that there was a traitor between Jeremy's crew, that broke the compass in the first place. Only Jeremy manages to escape using his cabin double wall. The next day he begins his quest to free all of his crew, take his money back and perhaps more.

		<desc>This game is quite different from its predecessor (Which was only released on the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum), with a new inventory system and improved animations. The game notably contains fewer enemies than the previous title. It is more centred around inventory based problem solving. The aim of the game is to solve various puzzles in order to obtain a boat so that Dizzy can return to his friends and family, the Yolkfolk. To do this Dizzy must journey through haunted mines, tree villages, as well as underwater. The game also features a subquest (albeit one essential to completing the game) in which thirty gold coins must be collected. Such subquests were found in many of the sequels.

> The legendary ***Treasure Island Dizzy*** — it’s truly brilliant, probably the best graphics, sound and gameplay you will ever see on the Amiga & ST! Incredible cartoony graphics and many extra puzzles and rooms.
>
> ***DIZZY’S CARTOON ADVENTURE ON TREASURE ISLAND!*** Explore the mysterious Island’s deserted Tree House Village. Fabulous Gold Mines. Huge Caves. Magic Shops and ***Secret Treasure!*** You can even go under water but remember your snorkel!
>
> Dizzy’s Treasure Island is ***brilliant*** — it’s like a real cartoon but with amazing gameplay. David Darling
>
> -- back of box

Critics consider this one of the most difficult Dizzy games as the energy bar system of later titles was not yet implemented and Dizzy is provided with only one life—contrasting with five in the first game and three in [Fantasy World Dizzy](/amiga/fantasy-world-dizzy), the immediate sequel, and most subsequent titles. Also unique to this game, the player is unable to select any particular item from the inventory for use—Dizzy simply puts down whichever item is at the top of the list. If Dizzy is underwater and the snorkel happens to be at the top of the inventory list, he will drop the snorkel when the player collects another item and instantly die. Treasure Island Dizzy therefore requires more foresight and planning than the other games in the series.

Adding to the difficulty of the game was the fact that the player had two main tasks to complete; the escape from the islands, and the collection of the thirty coins. Indeed, upon escaping the final island, the Shopkeeper character appears and tells Dizzy that he cannot leave without finding all thirty coins. Given that a number of the coins were hidden behind scenery and in enemies, this second task proved to be more difficult than the main game. Commodore Format printed a "complete" solution and map which did not include the hidden coins, frustrating many a player.</desc>

		<desc>After recreating the original board game as closely as possible with the first licensed game, Oxford did something different with the sequel. Each player now controls a spaceship, and the overall aim is to convince the Elders of the planet Genus to accept your people's plan to colonize it.

The Elders are all located in different parts of the galaxy, and can only be reached by travelling through the galaxy answering questions correctly, and answering a specific question once you get there. As a result, the gameplay isn't vastly different from the original. 

The six question categories are the same as the original, and there are 50 levels of question to clear, but the big difference is that the question category is random, so players who are only knowledgeable in one or two areas are no longer at an advantage.</desc>

***Turbo Out Run*** is a 1989 arcade racing game released by Sega. A 
follow-up to 1986's Out Run, it was released as a dedicated game, as 
well as an upgrade kit for the original Out Run board.




Like it predecessor, Turbo OutRun has players driving a Ferrari, this 
time a Ferrari F40. Players now traverse a set route across the entire 
continental United States from New York City to Los Angeles instead of 
the branching paths of the first game. In addition to a time limit, 
Turbo OutRun also adds a computer-controlled opponent driving a 
Porsche 959. The "Turbo" in the title also plays a factor as players 
can now press a button to receive a brief turbo boost of speed. 
Various power-ups which increase the vehicle's attributes can now be 
chosen at various stages of the game.




Ports of Turbo OutRun were released for personal computers, as well 
as Sega's own Master System and Mega Drive.

		<desc>The timedate is 3025. For decades peace, freedom, and the rule of law in galaxy Cobra 2 have been enforced by the United Planets Freedom Forces. The United Planets Ship, the Avalon 1, is drifting through the outer reaches of the known universe. Colonel Ardon C. Striker and his crew are preparing for the final passage through the barrier of the galaxy.

Suddenly, a huge battlecruiser materializes in close proximity of the Avalon 1. The crew hurry to take up their battle stations amid the sounding of the alert sirens. The automated defence systems of the ship activate, the anti-radiation shields surround the ship and finally the weapon systems are armed. Somehow, with some unknown technology, the enemy battlecruiser, with a flash of blinding light, neutralizes every defence system on the Avalon 1. The sound of an explosion fills the air as an airlock of the ship disintegrates and mutants begin to pour through. The crew fight desperately to save their ship with their phasers and dozens of the invaders fall to death, but they press forward their attack and the crew of the Avalon 1 start to fall down while desperately engaging them in hand-to-hand fighting. One of the Avalon 1 soldiers, Bren McGuire, with tears in his eyes, fires the last of his phaser bolts, downing a mutant and diving to the ground as a chunk of structure falls from above.

After an intense fight that wipes out all tripulants of the ship, there is silence as the evil emperor known as The Machine, half man half robot, enters the airlock and commands his mutants back to the battle cruiser. The Machine surveys the carnage, steps forward and comes to halt with one foot on the prone body of Bren McGuire. "Excellent", he says to himself, "the crew of Avalon 1 are no more". Then, without any further hesitation, he turns and leaves the ship. Bren McGuire lays still until he is certain that he is alone on the ravaged ship. Realizing that he is the only one left to combat the evil of the invaders and restore peace and freedom to the galaxy, he gets up and hurries to the equipment room. There, Bren sights the new Turrican fighting suits, which are built of the most advanced technology known to mankind. Climbing into the suit, one last cry is heard from him: "Revenge!"

Turrican II can be described as a cross between [Metroid](/browse?q=metroid) and [Psycho-Nics Oscar](/browse?q=psyco+nics+oscar). While the huge detailed labyrinth levels and the morph-ball function were inspired by Metroid, the overall graphics design and weapons were inspired by Psycho-Nics Oscar.

The game is divided into five distinct "worlds" each with its own themed music provided by [Chris Huelsbeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_H%C3%BClsbeck), plus a final showdown with the boss known as "The Machine". There is a music menu accessible by pressing the Space-Bar, where all the ingame music is available to be listened to. The music to Turrican II is widely regarded as one of Huelsbeck's best compositions, and it was performed live by an orchestra at the second Symphonic Game Music Concert in 2004.

There are three primary weapons Bounce, Laser and Multiple. Each weapon has several levels of firepower. In addition, there is a white laser "wall" which sweeps out from either side of the player. The player starts off with only three of these at the start of each life. There is also a very powerful secondary weapon activated by holding down the fire-button. This takes the form of a long segmented steerable laser beam which is essential for defeating Bosses.

		<desc>This game of the Turrican series was initially designed for the Mega Drive/Genesis, and later followed by an Amiga port under the title of Turrican 3: Payment Day. However, despite not being the original, the Amiga version was the one that was first commercially released in 1993, published by Rainbow Arts in Germany and Renegade in the rest of Europe. The Mega Drive version did not have a publisher and stayed unreleased from spring 1993 until 1994, when Data East took over its worldwide distribution. Data East itself released the game in North America, and contracted Sony Imagesoft for the game's distribution in Europe.

The Mega Drive version of the game was re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console service in Europe and Australia on March 22, 2008 and on April 14, 2008 in North America.

Time has passed since mankind last heard of The Machine. Bren McGuire is on a United Planets Freedom Forces mission when suddenly he sees his worst nightmares come true again. Years ago, he was the only survivor of the starship Avalon 1 when The Machine took out his comrades in an attempt to take over the galaxy. Back then, Bren sought revenge against his enemy and finally destroyed him in the planet of Landorin. Nobody expected a return of The Machine, but now, after many people enjoyed freedom and peace in the galaxy, the dark forces under his command are starting to assemble again.

In a sweep of terror, The Machine destroys dozens of planets and enslaves hundreds of peaceful people. The old memories arise again when Bren hears the last message of a young and beautiful girl. Desperately she cries for help, as her planet is being taken over by the soldiers of The Machine. As Bren receives the message, he slips into his Turrican assault suit and swears final revenge.

Once again, Bren McGuire, now the current leader of the Freedom Forces, is the only hope in a crucial mission to definitely destroy the grasp of evil represented by The Machine. A lone warrior against the evil hordes of The Machine, Bren jumps out of his ship to face the ultimate challenge.

		<desc>Turrican is a 1990 video game programmed and designed by Manfred Trenz. It was first developed for the Commodore 64 by Rainbow Arts, but was ported to other systems later. In addition to concept design and character creation, Trenz personally programmed Turrican on the Commodore 64. A sequel, Turrican II, followed 1991 for the Commodore 64 and other platforms.

The lost colony of Alterra is a completely man-made lifeworld abandoned long ago in a nearby galaxy. Alterra is actually five colonies in one. Each self-contained habitat has been separately bio-engineered by a powerful ecosystem generation network known as a Multiple Organism Unit Link. MORGUL, for short. Early colonists used MORGUL to render Alterra inhabitable. But a cataclysmic quake severed all system interface functions, and MORGUL murderously rebelled. The few colonists lucky enough to escape told a grim tale of a higher intelligence gone berserk.

For generations, mankind sought a return to Alterra. Finally, genetic science created a saviour: Turrican, a mutant warrior, bio-engineered for the task of planetary reclamation. In the meantime, MORGUL has diligently twisted Alterran life forms to his brutal, destructive purposes. Thus, Turrican's challenges consist of eliminating hostile organisms from Alterra's five multi-level worlds and, finally, destroying the three faces of MORGUL.

		<desc>Finding the mysterious Elephant's Graveyard in Africa was your Father's lifelong quest. When he disappears you are determined to find out what might have happened to him, and what secrets may lie within.

This side-scrolling action game is split into three stages, taking in the harsh and barren desert, an underground network of caves, and a tough tribal jungle. The natives are hostile to your presence, and weaponry must be found to fend them off, although its use does little to put the natives at ease initially. The machete to cut through the jungle is equally important. At many other points you will need to use objects you have found along the way. The backgrounds are in full 3D and can serve to obscure the character when he is behind trees or rocks.</desc>

		<desc>After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named Exodus before their death. Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon the hero from Earth to find and stop him.

The third title in the Ultima series was the first to feature a party of adventurers instead of a single player character. The party is created at the beginning of the game by assigning various class combinations and determining the characters' attributes. The game has larger and more detailed towns, populated by NPCs the protagonist can converse with to obtain clues. Like in earlier Ultima games, exploration is divided between top-down overworld locations and first-person 3D dungeons. This installment introduces separate combat screens where player-controlled party fights multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based system.</desc>

		<desc>The Avatar, the embodiment of the Eight Virtues and the hero of Britannia, is called back to deal with a grave threat. Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.

Ultima V uses the basics of the Ultima IV engine, an overhead perspective for the map of Britannia and its towns, and a rosette-compass 3D view for the dungeons. The battle system also resembles that of the previous game, with separate battle screens and navigation of character icons in turn-based style. Many of the gameplay elements of the predecessor return, including the complex spell system (reagents must be bought in order to cast spells), recruitable party members, moongates that teleport the party between locations, various means of transportation (horses, ships, etc., with the notable addition of a magic carpet), and so on. Character creation based on morally ambiguous questions and basic leveling up system have been preserved as well. In comparison to the predecessor, the classes have been reduced to four.

Additional challenges include navigating characters through the Underworld, a vast underground area containing many hazards; random presence of Shadowlords in the cities, which influences the behavior of their inhabitants, making them run away, steal from, or attack the Avatar; inscriptions in a runic alphabet that must be deciphered by the player, and others.

The game has a noticeably more detailed world than any of its predecessors; the towns are much larger, with many unique buildings and objects represented graphically. Ultima V introduces physical interaction with the game world: many objects can be pushed or pulled, the main character can sit down on a chair (which is graphically shown), etc. It also incorporates a day/night cycle and schedules for non-playable characters: for example, it is impossible to shop at night because the shopkeepers are sleeping. Dialogues with NPCs have been enhanced, featuring more unique and detailed conversation topics.</desc>

		<desc>UMS (Universal Military Simulator) attempts to cover the ground of games like Empire and go beyond, simulating almost every aspect of warfare in a realistic manner. Battles can range from ancient history to a science-fiction future, with famed battled such as Gettysburg and the Battle of Hastings built in. The view system operates at multiple levels, from a single unit up to the whole theater.

However, there is no naval element whatsoever and the design pays little attention to extremely important wargaming concepts like fog of war.

The game spawned a sequel, UMS II.</desc>

Gameplay is simplistic - he goes into right side, avoid obstacles like lasers barriers, and kill alien creatures. Sometimes he needs to hurry - for example, when the floor collapses. Killed enemies drop shells, the player can collect them for new weapons.

The game uses big animated sprites, for this reason, the player sees only the immediate environment.</desc>

		<desc>Universal Warrior (or The Machines, as is the official title of the PC version) is a top-down maze shooter in the vein of Gauntlet and Alien Breed, with added economic elements.

The game alternates between equipment management and the actual in-level action, in which a remote-controlled robot runs through maze-like maps and shoots mechanical enemies. With the money earned in these sci-fi contests, improved equipment can be bought in five categories, making the robot more powerful, more maneuverable and less easy to damage. On the other hand, getting damaged means you must spend money on repairs. This encourages careful and effective playing.

The game can be played solo, competitively in two-player hot-seat mode or cooperatively in split-screen mode.

The Amiga and the PC version of the game have the same basic design, but entirely different levels. For a comprehensive list of differences between the versions see the trivia section.</desc>

You set out to escort a diplomat on a trip to the hyperspace booster (a key element of Universe 2) to investigate the disappearance of shipments from Earth to this remote corner of the star map. The story takes a quick twist when you and your crew are captured, forcing you to rack up some criminal charges during your escape. You'll spend the rest of your time looking for evidence about the missing shipments, which will clear you of the charges as well as wrap up the mystery.</desc>

		<desc>Story

The backstory, as well as an extensive mythology of the fictional world (also called "Unreal") is given in the game manual.

A creator being called Sleeper, sent his servant Fragor to Unreal to create life with some life-giving eggs. Fragor was hite by a comet and fell on Unreal releasing chaotic forces on the planet. While the elements were separated or mixed in uncontrollable ways, the eggs formed life on the planet. Forces of evil dominated the elements while the evil Polymorphe, who has the form of a floating flaming head, became absolute master. Unknown to him, the civilization of the Barbares, created out of a single egg which fell in a secluded valley.

Two Barbares, Artaban and Isolde, befriend a dragon named Dracus who came from the sky. When Dracus did not show up for some time, Isolde was caught by Polymorphe's servants while calling for him. Imprisoned in a dungeon, she was ordered to marry him, or Polymorphe would kill all life in the valley. Dracus and Artaban prepare to go to her rescue, and a mysterious wizard equips Artaban with an ancient sword forged from Fragor's comet.

The objective of the game is to guide Artaban (either on foot or riding Dracus on his back) to the Burning Sea where Polymorphe's Flying Castle is found.

Gameplay

The game combined two different gameplay genres. Both Galaxy Force and Rastan Saga were infpirations for the game.

In five of the chapters, the player (as Artaban) guides Dracus as they fly over a natural landscape (forests, river canyons, glaciers or seas of lava). The gameplay of those levels are of a 3d scrolling shooters, the view being from behind Dracus. The player must avoid obstacles (like trees or spires of rock) and adversaries that come from the distance. Dracus fires fireballs that can destroy some of the monsters or parts of the scenery.

Dracus can fire more and stronger fireballs, when the player collects power-ups that appear on the ground. The player can attain 12 levels of firepower, but whenever the player crashes on the scenery, Dracus loses a level. Other bonuses include restoration of health and some limited invincibility.

The other parts of the game are of the platform arcade-adventure genre. The player guides Artabon on foot traversing forests, swamps and castles. He encounters adversaries which can be killed with the sword. The sword gives some limited interaction with the environment: and can be "charged" by touching fire found at some points of the levels; there are also some kinds of spells that give Artabon the power to hurl water or fireballs with the sword. The sword also is used for some puzzles.

The player has 100 health points. In the beginning of each level, the player is awarded 50 lost health points. There is also the option to save the game in 3 available slots.

		<desc>This one on one future sport combines ideas from a number of real-world competitions, most notably the schoolgirl favourite Netball (I wonder why the ad blurb makes no mention of this?). The action is viewed isometrically, so moving the joystick up moves your droid north-east, down moves south-west, and so on.

The aim is to score more points than your opponent in each match, and be the first to win four matches (against either a human or computer opponent), before moving up to the next difficulty level. There is a goal in the middle at each end, and the ball can be advanced by shooting it (the length of a shot is affected by pushing the joystick up or down with fire pressed) as you can't run with the ball, or hold onto it for long. The main novel idea in the game is the shaping of the pitches, which are viewed in full 3D and have bumps and big divots all around.</desc>

At the start of the game you have $500 to bet with. The betting limits are $200 for Black Jack and Roulette and $5 for Video Poker and Slots. Once you have placed a bet you only need to hit play, the computer will automatically bet the same amount of money again and again, however if you play roulette you have to manually place your bet on the game board. Once you run out of money you may chose between borrowing another $500 or quit. The game features a save/load function for one game.</desc>

		<desc>For any space pilot, The Fortresses contain all the wealth any man could imagine so men have tried and many have failed. The few who have succeeded enjoyed the wealth but that amount turned them crazy and protective of the wealth and so became guardians of the four fortresses. You are a wealthy experienced pilot looking for that one last challenge, so you are determined to fly your ship and conquer it all, not for the money, just because it's there. If the going gets too tough you can change into an eagle for a short time, you are invulnerable but you can't fire.

Venom Wing is a side scrolling shoot-em-up where the screen scrolls automatically over four levels. Levels one and three have you gradually scrolling downwards before facing an end of level boss. Levels two and four are more traditional horizontal scrolling from left to right before facing them end of level bosses again. There are various power-up icons to collect including triple fire, a drone to fly with you and one to change into the eagle.</desc>

		<desc>The Tangent Empire are preparing to attack the earth with their convoy of tanks, and it is you who has been sent forward to destroy the 14 space stations which make up the potential invasion threat.

There are 3 sub-levels on each station, which can be played in any order. The action scrolls in every direction, with you guiding your tank-link droid around to shoot the opposition droids. The tank takes a while to steer, making it initially harder to avoid contact with those enemies. Each level contains energy stars, which can be traded in for upgrades such as improved weapons and extra speed after each level.</desc>

		<desc>A third game in the tank combat series, following from Team Yankee (whose story and setting came from a book) and Pacific Islands (set in an imaginary 1995 war). The third game imagines a situation in which Iraq invades Kuwait for a second time. 

The series' main distinguishing feature was the way you always viewed all 4 tanks in a platoon at the same time, via a split screen. Action here is purely mouse-driven. The AI has been significantly updated from previous games in the series. A full roster of tanks and weapons are included, with Iraq mainly using Soviet machinery. A major consideration involves destroying particular buildings for money, and preventing other particular ones being destroyed, also for financial reasons.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2045, The Earth was attacked by aliens from Sirius. Looking like insects and believed to be related with the insect life forms known to humans, the Sirians have shown no mercy: a third of human population was annihilated. This assault led to the dissolution of all political borders on the Earth. The humans have united to defend themselves against the common enemy. An organisation called the Fist of Earth was formed to defend the planet, its most important military base, the SolBase, built in the orbit. The Fist of Earth sends a fighter pilot navigating the FOE-57 spacecraft on a series of missions to stop the Sirians and protect humanity.

Warhead is a mission-based space combat simulation. Objectives include destroying enemies, protecting friendly forces, as well as search and.rescue missions. The player proceeds to the next mission after having completed the preceding one. The space ship is navigated with the mouse; the keyboard controls offer autopilot modes, multiple weapons including mines and stinger missiles, an HUD display, multiple viewpoints, targeting and navigation, all of which must be used during combat.</desc>

		<desc>Wayne Gretzky Hockey 2 is a top-down hockey game. The player participates in a match against either Canada or the USA. There are many options to change the match settings, e.g. the difficulty level, speed or the referee's behaviour. The editor offers the possibility to create new tactics or lineups as well as changing the abilities and names of the athletes. In contrast to most other sports games, the athletes are controlled indirectly: the player uses the input device to show the athlete where he should move. The active athlete can be changed. 

This is basically the same game as its predecessor. The main additions are additional match options and a co-op playing mode.</desc>

		<desc>This point and click adventure takes a fantasy setting, in which you play a Wizard deemed to be ‘good’ taking on a less good one. To fulfill the prophecy you have been given in a limited time of 3 days, he must go on 3 quests, solving various puzzles along the way to be rewarded 3 grains of sand, that he must place in a hourglass to kill an evil wizard. Objects around the levels are always detected by the cursor, making each screen and the challenges within quick to comprehend. Generally you have to solve each puzzle in sequence.

Like the company's Gobliins Series, the interface is simplified, and the game has a heavier focus on self-sufficient puzzles than other traditional adventures. The game experiments with the toning of the graphics, using a faux-sepia style outside and some bright colours inside, which changes the atmosphere somewhat.</desc>

		<desc>This game came as a pack-in title with Loriciel's light gun controller of the same name. Most light guns opted for a futuristic look and feel, but the West Phaser was inspired more by 19th century Colt revolvers, and aptly enough the bundled game was a Western-themed shooter - with similar mechanics to Operation Wolf, except for the stationary screens.

Up to six players can pick their characters from a Who's Who of the American Old West: Doc Holliday, Calamity Jane, Will Bill Hickok, and every other big-name lawman and gunfighter in collective imagination. Outlaws like Jesse James, Billy the Kid and Belle Starr are sowing terror in the murky saloons and dusty streets, and it's your job to stop them if you're after that coveted Sheriff's badge... or the big fat rewards on their heads.

Each location throws wave after wave of humorously-drawn attackers at you - bandits, cowboys, Indians, Mexicans, all thrown together into a big pile of cartoonish violence. A burning candle represents your life bar and there's plenty of enemies trying to snuff it out, so you'll have to be quick on the draw (but don't forget to protect the innocent). When the face of the bandit you're after starts blinking on the status bar, prepare for the showdown: nail them and the reward is yours.

Apparently the light gun was not the biggest success, and less than three years later the game was re-released, this time with support for other input devices - and a new title, Steve McQueen: Westphaser, despite having exactly nothing to do with any of McQueen's characters.</desc>

		<desc>Following on from Brutal Sports Football came this interpretation of soccer, released alongside the 1994 World Cup. In one player mode you can play a Wild Cup or a League system; two player games are restricted to single ‘Unfriendly’ matches.

Unlike its predecessor, the game uses an isometric viewpoint, perhaps because the original FIFA was so popular at the time. A number of vicious moves are on offer, with tackles Vinnie Jones would flinch at along with lethal head-butts and shoulder barges. If a game finishes drawn, it goes into a ‘Penalty Shoot Out’, which involves going round shooting the opposition;– the last team standing wins. The pre-match screens include attacking at defensive play styles, transfers and the chance to buy items such as rocket launchers and shields.</desc>

		<desc>New-York, Year 1998. The once most prestigious city in the world, has now become a fighting zone. Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in that part of town that the marginals and gangs are living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. The other half of the city consists of fancy mansions, in some of which the most important drug barons reside. Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city using the enormous profits they make from dealing drugs and weapons. They now have succeeded in endangering the country's economy.

The U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible crisis, called the CIA to run several types of operations in order to get rid of this bad substitute of government. The C.I.A., headed up by "The Boss", has to clean up the city of its crooks. One plan is to reorganize the city by placing security check-points at strategic positions. The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly proved to be an unprecedented success. The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were greatly outnumbered and couldn't match the extremely well armed law enforcement troops.

On May 7, during a successful raid, the state police special branch, took possession of a huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than two million dollars. This raid was an important stage in the whole operation. Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the heads of the crime organizations now started making plans for themselves: They needed to regain their control over the city and above all, secure their territories. On May 15, they kidnapped "The Boss" in order to get from him the names of his operatives involved in the C.I.A. fight against organized crime. This way, they were convinced they could stay in control of the situation and become even more powerful.


Your mission is to liberate "The Boss" and to bring him back safely. You're gonna be dropped from the chopper with your panther at the spot where "The Boss" was last seen. You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is trained to protect you closely.

You'll have to travel through the various parts of the city, in search of the hostage, and you will find that your street fighting skills will prove to be very useful.

In each part of the city, you will confront various enemies and their gang leaders. They will become more and more skilled in combat as you progress. Some of them are so powerful that it would be wise to save bullets for these particular fights. Once you reach the point where "The Boss" is held prisoner, you must rescue him and safely escort him back to a safe place.

On the way back, you will have to be particularly careful, since you will have to protect "The Boss" whose physical condition has been worn out.

Wild Streets is a side-scrolling arcade game, in which you fight enemies using punches, kicks, your gun and sometimes your panther will help you.</desc>

		<desc>Wild West World is a strategy game in which you build up an economic empire in the old west of the 1800's. Farming, ranching, mining, and hunting, are all methods for generating cash to buy land and build your economic empire. Employees of various trades must be hired, farms, ranches, and mines established, and all must be kept supplied with livestock, food, and tools. Eventually, the only way to grow, will be to play dirty tricks on your competition, which include the hire of a gang of outlaws to harass or eliminate them, to bribe Indians to burn them out and kill their workers, and more.</desc>

		<desc>Wild Wheels is an action game in which two teams of five cars each try to bring a ball into other team's goal for points (more points are awarded for risky moves) and destroying all enemy cars. The player takes control over a single car which can be shown in various camera positions, most prominently directly behind the vehicle or top-down. There are also special fields on the field which grant advantages when passed. 

The single-player portion basically consists of a series of elimination matches with the goal to win all leagues of increasing difficulty levels. Between matches, the points earned with goals can be reinvested into new cars with better statistics - additionally they are also divided into five categories with different roles during the matches. The game features two control modes: in professional mode the player rotates the car when pushing left or right while arcade mode allows direct turns.</desc>

But he can only work on windows which are closed and the residents like to look out of the window - in this case Willy uses a horn to chase them away. He also needs to look out for and dodge objects or people which fall out of higher windows. A bird likes to use cleaned windows as toilet and a special cleaner has to used to deal with this. But it needs to be used with caution because it destroys regular windows.</desc>

		<desc>The game is a horizontally scrolling shooter set over a number of World War II missions. The player starts each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which he/she has to protect from attacks by Japanese planes. The goal is to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, turrets and barracks on a series of islands and killing enemy soldiers either with bombs or by machine gun. The weapons to complete these objectives, besides machine guns, are a limited number of bombs, rockets and torpedoes. On some missions, the player must also sink Japanese vessels, such as destroyers, battleships, and aircraft carriers. The player has a finite amount of fuel and munitions, which can be replenished by returning to the carrier. The player's aircraft can be destroyed by accumulated damage from enemy fire or by crashing into the terrain.

		<desc>This is a winter sports game that lets you compete in five Olympic events: Downhill skiing, Biathlon, Slalom, Ski Jump and Bob Sled. It is very similar to offerings like Winter Games from Epyx.

In Downhill skiing, you must avoid the obstacles and make it to the bottom of the hill, by swerving left and right and adjusting your speed by pushing the joystick forward and back. The Slalom is similar, involving skiing around flags.

In the ski jump, you must position the skis for a proper landing. In the bobsled event, you must carefully control the angles so your bobsled doesn't flip. The Biathlon event combines skiing to shooting ranges and shooting the targets archery-style.</desc>

		<desc>Alice was sitting at the river bank with her sister and got drowsy. Suddenly, she sees a white rabbit who was hurrying somewhere, muttering something to himself. Curious, Alice follows the rabbit into a hole that leads into a bizarre world populated by strange and exotic creatures. Alice has to use her wits in order to understand Wonderland's twisted laws of logic, and figure out a way to return home.

Wonderland is a text adventure with graphics, based on Lewis Carroll's classic novel Alice in Wonderland. The game follows the book's general story, while adding many descriptions, locations and puzzles of its own. The interaction with the environment is done mostly by typing; however, commands may also appear in pop-up menus and can be selected by the player. Sometimes puzzles need to be solved in order to be able to advance. The game features windows with adjustable size, separating graphical display from inventory, command interface, text descriptions, and other options.</desc>

		<desc>World Class Soccer is a soccer (football) game that ties in with the 1990 football World Cup. The game uses a top-down perspective for matches and features the full World Cup structure and all the 24 teams who were involved. Multiple formations and team selections are available before each match. The ball sticks to the feet of the players, who can be tackled either by doing a block tackle, or attempting a slide tackle, which risks giving away a foul. Matches can vary between 4 and 90 minutes, and each player has differing skills and behaviour style depending on his team's relative ability.</desc>

		<desc>World Cup 90 is a soccer game capitalizing the event of World Cup of 1990 in Italy. All the national teams participating at the event are included; however, due to the lack of a license, the players' names are fictional. The player can create custom teams (name, tactics and color of the jersey) and change the team's roster. Multiplayer features two players mode (1 vs. 1 or 2 vs. CPU), and through additional interface, it is possible to add other two players.</desc>

		<desc>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. 

There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.

There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</desc>

		<desc>Xenon 2: Megablast is a vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed & health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.</desc>

		<desc>X-Out is a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up. Unlike most comparable games (e.g. R-Type), the game is not set in outer space or even in the air - instead, the fight between good and evil is underwater.

Through five levels, the player has to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. After having completed a level, the player gets to purchase new weapons; instead of simply buying upgrades, it is possible to customize the ship by placing new weapons anywhere on it.</desc>

		<desc>Like its predecessor X-Out, Z-Out is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up. A horde of largely-organic enemies threaten the safety of your planet, and they must be destroyed over the course of six levels.There are power-ups available, but the game is less centered around these than some are. 

Whilst some shoot 'em ups are much easier with a second player, Z-Out takes design steps to legislate against this. In a 2-player game, most power-ups are unavailable, and even those which are only come into effect on level 3. Another variation is that the 1-player mode uses restart points, but the 2-player mode does not, so as to keep both players in the same place.</desc>

		<desc>Zak McKracken is a tabloid reporter (and not a very good one at that). After having a psychedelic dream one day, Zak realizes that something is wrong -- space aliens are dumbifying the general public through the telephone system. Zak must stop this, but he can't do it alone. After finding a strange crystal, Zak manages to get the help of the anthropologist Annie and her friends, Melissa and Leslie. The four unlikely heroes must now figure out a way to destroy the dumbifying devices and save the Earth.

Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure similar in gameplay to Lucasfilm's breakthrough title Maniac Mansion. The player chooses verb commands (Open, Pick Up, Give, etc.; there are no Look or Talk commands) to interact with the game world. The game features up to four controllable protagonists; it is possible to switch between them at any time after they have been introduced, and also exchange inventory items if the characters are in the same location. The game can be described as a "globe-trotting" adventure, since the heroes are required to travel to different exotic countries and even leave the Earth for a while in order to complete it. Some of the puzzles are optional or can be solved in different ways.</desc>

		<desc>With a similar gameplay as the isometric Desert Strike, Zeewolf offers arcadesque helicopter combat in a 3D surrounding. Despite its mainly action-oriented gameplay, the 32 levels often involve support, transport and rescue missions - dropping or refueling friendly units in the combat zone, for example. In exchange, other units serve you as rearming points or help you fighting the enemy.

The order of the levels can be chosen freely and the game may be played with joystick or - a little unusual - with the mouse. The game uses a third-person engine, looking at the helicopter from the side and displaying a certain amount of landmass in a square around it.</desc>

***Zombi*** is an icon-driven arcade adventure video game. It was 
Ubisoft's first publication, released when the company was established 
in 1986.




A first-person arcade adventure, it draws inspiration from the 
George A. Romero film Dawn of the Dead; the player controlling four 
protagonists exploring a zombie-filled shopping mall. It draws from 
many parts of the film, including the gun shops, the escalators, and 
the articulated trucks used to block the entrances. If a character's 
health is depleted, he turns into a zombie, which then roams the room 
they died in. Zombies can be killed either by numerous body shots, 
or a single shot to the head. Characters were named after the creators 
of the game.




The original Amstrad CPC version was programmed by Yannick Cadin and 
S.L. Coemelck, with graphics by Patrick Daher and music by Philippe 
Marchiset.




It was re-released in 1990, with ports developed for the ZX Spectrum 
(by Geoff Phillips, Colin Jones and Steve Chance), Commodore 64 
(Jean Noel Moyne, Laurent Poujoulat, Jean Francois Auroux), Amiga 
(Alexander Yarmitsky), Atari ST and DOS.




The ZX Spectrum version was awarded 87% by Sinclair User magazine and 
77% byYour Sinclair, both reviewers were impressed with the 
immersive atmosphere.




CU Amiga awarded the Amiga version of the game 85%, whilst German 
magazine Amiga Joker scored it at 69%.




Zzap!64 awarded the Commodore 64 version of the game 72%. The 
reviewer said that the gameplay is outdated and is very similar to 
Catch 23, a 1987 ZX Spectrum game.
