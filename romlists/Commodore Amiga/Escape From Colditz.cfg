>Colditz Castle was the most dreaded of all the POW camps in World War II - with a reputation of being totally escape proof. 
 
 
 
 
>This is the story of those men who refused to concede defeat, the indestructible prisoners of war who, against all the odds, managed to escape and make their way to freedom. By ingenuity, cunning and sheer daredevil bravado they achieved the impossible, and their heroism has rightly passed into the annals of history… 
 
 
 
 
>Now comes your chance to try to match their courage and determination as you attempt to guide your four men to freedom. You will need to utilise many of the objects you find contained in the castle and avoid any sentries or patrolling guards. 
 
 
 
 
>You must plan your escape route and collect the relevant equipment in order to be successful. By using all of your men you will discover ways to divert the attention of guards, set up ‘stooges’ to warn you of approaching patrols and unearth the various means of escape.
