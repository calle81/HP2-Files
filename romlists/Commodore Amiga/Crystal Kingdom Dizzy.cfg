***Crystal Kingdom Dizzy*** is an adventure video game featuring the  
character Dizzy released in December 1992 by Codemasters. The  
Oliver Twins—who were heavily involved in the design and programming  
of previous Dizzy games—had less involvement with this one. The game is  
the last title to date in the core Dizzy series. 
 
 
 
 
This was the first full-price Dizzy game released for home computers;  
previous games had been released at budget prices. This elicited some  
criticism, as despite the much higher tag, the game was no bigger or  
more complex than its much lower-priced predecessors. 
 
 
 
 
The Spectrum version was voted number 70 in the Your Sinclair Readers  
Top 100 Games of All Time.
