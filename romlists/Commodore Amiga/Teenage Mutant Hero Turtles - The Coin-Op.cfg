***Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles***, released as Teenage Mutant Ninja  
Turtles: Super Kame Ninja in Japan and ***Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles***  
in Europe, is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up released by Konami as a  
coin-operated video game in 1989. It is based on the first Teenage  
Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series which began airing in the winter  
of 1987. The original coin-operated game was distributed to the arcades  
in two variants: a standard 2-player version that allowed either player  
to choose their character and a deluxe 4-player version with each player  
controlling a different character. Home versions of the game were  
released for various platforms. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The computer ports of the arcade game were released by Image Works and  
ported by Probe Software in 1991 for the ZX Spectrum, Amiga,  
Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, PC and Commodore 64. The title was changed to  
Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: The Coin Op in the European versions  
(Hero being the re-branding of the license in Europe due to censorship  
issues) and lacked the extra stages and bosses from the NES game.
