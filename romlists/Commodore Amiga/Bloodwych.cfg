***Bloodwych*** is a dungeon role-playing video game, a dungeon crawler,  
developed for the Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS as well as the major 8-bit  
home computer platforms. Its box featured artwork by Chris Achilleos. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The plotline identifies the player as a champion of Trazere who, after  
recruiting up to three fellow champions, travels through dungeons and  
mazes fighting creatures along the way to find and destroy the evil  
Zendick, and banish the Lord of Entropy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
***Gameplay*** 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All of the champions fall into the four classes of Warrior, Mage,  
Adventurer or Thief, each with their own particular capability. Within  
each class there are four characters available, each with their own  
colour of Red, Blue, Green or Yellow. Each colour also has its own  
particular advantage, largely with respect to the families of spells  
the character will be most adept at casting and developing. However,  
that colour is also important when it comes to matching up coloured  
rings later in the game to magnify the effects of spell-casting. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One particularly memorable quirk of the game is the ability granted to  
players to hold simple conversations with traders, other champions,  
and even enemies during combat. Stock pseudo-medieval phrases such as  
"Truly my courage is remarkable" and "Begone, thou oaf" are selected  
using a menu, and can be used in combination to flatter a desired  
companion, aggravate an enemy, or lower the price of an item which  
the player wishes to purchase. Many gameplayers have found that the  
price of a long sword (RRP 10 gold pieces) can fall to as little as  
6 or 7 after the shopkeeper has been buttered-up with phrases such  
as "Thou seems fine" - particularly when this strategy is used in  
conjunction with the Beguile spell (most effectively cast by Megrim). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bloodwych is also remarkable for the sheer scale of its maps. Gameplay  
can easily last weeks until the player eventually navigates his way  
though mazes and past monsters to the start of the enormous and  
fiendish "towers", in which the gameplay becomes focused on the task  
of collecting crystals, with a view to destroying Zendick and his  
associates. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bloodwych was inspired by Dungeon Master from 1987, like many other  
similar games (or even clones) in this era, for instance the Eye of  
the Beholder series.
