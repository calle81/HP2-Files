***California Games*** is a 1987 Epyx sports video game for many home  
computers and video game consoles. Branching from their popular Summer  
Games and Winter Games series, this game consisted of some sports  
purportedly popular in California including skateboarding, freestyle  
footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The game sold very well, topping game selling charts for winter months.  
It also got very positive reaction from reviewers, many of whom consider  
California Games to be the last classic Epyx sports game, due to staff  
changes not long after its release. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The game was followed in 1991 by California Games 2, but the sequel  
failed to match the original's success. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Originally released for the Apple II and Commodore 64, this game was  
very lucrative for Epyx and was released for several other platforms  
over the years. It was eventually ported to Amiga, Apple IIGS,  
Atari 2600, Atari ST, Atari Lynx, DOS, Sega Mega Drive, Amstrad CPC,  
ZX Spectrum, Nintendo Entertainment System, MSX and Sega Master System.
