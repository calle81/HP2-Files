***Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles***, originally released as Fierce Turtle  
Ninja Legend in Japan and later as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles in Europe, 
is a 1989 platform game for the Famicom/NES. The game was released in  
Japan through Konami themselves, then in North America through Konami's  
Ultra Games imprint, followed by a release through the European equivalent 
, Palcom Software, in PAL regions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This was the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video game, and is based  
on the 1987 TV series, which was in its third season at the time of the  
game's original release, although the art style more resembles the  
original TMNT comic series. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The game was ported to various home computer platforms in 1990, including 
the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amiga. The DOS version is 
infamous, as it contains a gap that is impossible to cross without  
cheating.
