***Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance*** is a video game  
released in January 1988 for various home computer systems and  
consoles. The game is based on the first Dragonlance campaign module  
for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, Dragons of  
Despair, and the first Dragonlance novel Dragons of Autumn Twilight.  
Heroes of the Lance focuses on the journey of eight heroes through  
the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth, where they must face the ancient  
dragon Khisanth and retrieve the relic, the Disks of Mishakal. 
 
 
 
 
***Gameplay*** 
 
 
 
 
Heroes of the Lance is a side-scrolling action game. The game used  
actual Dungeons & Dragons statistics, with statistics for the  
characters exactly as they were in the rule books. Eight heroes  
from the Dragonlance novels series must be assembled for the quest,  
and only one is visible on the screen at a time; when one on-screen  
hero dies, the next in line appears. 
 
 
 
 
While Heroes of the Lance is a faithful representation of the books it  
is based on, it was a departure from the usual role-playing video game  
style of most Dungeons & Dragons games, and many players lamented its  
difficult gameplay interface[citation needed] which consists of using  
one character at a time in horizontally scrolling fighting. Each  
character has different types of attacks and spells making them more  
suited to fighting different enemies but they merely act as "lives"  
for the player as in more traditional fighting games, removing one of  
the main strategies of role-playing games from the game.
