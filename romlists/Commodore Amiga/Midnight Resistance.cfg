***Midnight Resistance*** (ミッドナイトレジスタンス Middonaito Rejisutansu?) is a  
side-scrolling action shooting game produced by Data East for the  
arcades in 1989. The game was ported by Data East to the Sega Mega Drive  
in 1990 and by Ocean Software to various home computer platforms during  
the same year. The game is set in a dystopian future where the player  
controls a member of a resistance movement who goes on a mission to  
rescue his kidnapped family from a mad scientist. 
 
 
 
 
***Ocean Software*** released ports for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum,  
Amstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga, and the Atari ST, some which were  
developed by Special FX. The Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions  
are of particular note and are regularly mentioned in lists of greatest 
games ever made for these systems. 
 
 
 
 
The Spectrum version had a completely redesigned, chunky, cartoony  
style to it. It had push screen scrolling and very few on-screen  
colours due to hardware limitations, but it is considered by many  
to be one of the stand out technical achievements for the hardware  
and was awarded a score of 90% in Sinclair User and 93% in CRASH  
magazine. It was also included in their 100 best Spectrum games  
ever made, reaching number 10. The Spectrum version was also voted  
number 11 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. 
The Commodore version stayed relatively faithful to the original  
arcade version. It was critically acclaimed by most publications  
of the time and gained a score of 90% from Zzap!64 Magazine.  
It was also featured in their top 100 C64 games ever made.  
The ZX Spectrum version was ported to the Amstrad CPC in a stripped  
down version as was common for the era, due to the two computers  
sharing the same processor. It is missing the music and colour of  
the 128 Spectrum version and has less buyable weapons at the end of  
each stage. It achieved a review of 86% in Amstrad Action magazine.
