***Chip's Challenge*** is a top-down tile-based puzzle video game  
created in 1989 by Chuck Sommerville originally for the hand-held  
Atari Lynx. Chip's Challenge was then later ported to multiple formats  
including the Amiga, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, DOS, and Windows,  
included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack and Best of Microsoft  
Entertainment Pack (the last of which was written by Tony Krueger in 1991) 
. Microsoft licensed Chip's Challenge from Epyx to write a DOS and  
Windows version of the game; while porting the game, the logic was  
slightly changed from the original version. It has also been converted  
to the TI-84+ calculator and the TI-89 Titanium. 
 
 
 
 
The original game was designed and coded by Chuck Sommerville, who also  
made about a third of the levels.[3] Most of the conversions from the  
Atari Lynx original to other formats were carried out by Images  
Software in the UK. 
 
 
 
 
The premise of the game is that high-school nerd Chip McCallahan has  
met Melinda The Mental Marvel in the school science laboratory and must  
navigate through Melinda's "Clubhouse" (a series of increasingly  
difficult puzzles) in order to prove himself and gain membership to  
the very exclusive Bit Buster Club. 
 
 
 
 
***Gameplay*** 
 
 
 
 
Chip's Challenge consists of a series of 148 two-dimensional levels  
(149 in Microsoft's version) which feature the player character,  
Nerdy Chip McCallahan, often called just Chip, and various game  
elements such as computer chips, buttons, locked doors, water and  
lethal monsters. Gameplay involves using arrow keys, directional pad  
or mouse to move Chip about each of the levels in turn, collecting  
enough chips to open the chip socket at the end of each level, get to  
the exit, and move on to the next level. 
 
 
 
 
While the same set of rules applies to each level, there are many  
different kinds of levels. Some are action-oriented and some are  
puzzle-oriented. Most levels have a time limit. Types of levels  
include solving a block-pushing puzzle to clear a path, dodging  
enemies, and moving through a maze. Levels can be skipped by entering  
an appropriate four-letter non-case-sensitive password. For the PC  
versions, game progress is automatically saved. If one is having a  
lot of trouble with a level, the game allows the player to skip to  
the next level. Progress is measured in terms of completed levels  
and player score, which is a sum of the scores obtained on each level.  
Level scores for timed levels can be improved by quickly completing  
the level, and scores on all levels can be improved by using fewer  
attempts to complete the level.
