***Narc*** is a 1988 arcade game designed by Eugene Jarvis for Williams  
Electronics and programmed by George Petro. It was one of the first  
ultra-violent video games and a frequent target of parental criticism  
of the arcade game industry. The object is to arrest and kill drug  
offenders, confiscate their money and drugs, and defeat "Mr. Big". 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It was the first game in the newly restarted Williams Electronics  
coin-op division, and features their notable use of digitized  
graphics (later made famous in games such as Mortal Kombat).  
In fact, the quality of the graphics in terms of number of colors  
would not be surpassed until the game Mortal Kombat II  
(released in 1993). The game features what in arcade terminology is  
termed a medium resolution monitor – higher resolution than  
televisions and normal arcade monitors, although often in a smaller  
physical size. NARC was also the very first arcade game to utilize  
the TI TMS34010, which is a 32-bit processor. The game was also  
notable for the numerous voice samples used during and between  
levels. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Narc was ported to the NES and several home computer systems in 1990. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Programmed by David Leitch at Sales Curve Interactive and published by  
Ocean Software, the versions of the game for the ZX Spectrum and  
Amstrad CPC computers generally received positive reviews,  
including 9/10 from CRASH, 8/10 from Sinclair User and 72% from Your  
Sinclair. Matt Bielby of Your Sinclair called it "one of the most  
objectionable Speccy games I've seen in ages", and called it  
"repetitive" and the plot "utter nonsense. "
