Datastorm is similar to the arcade game, [Defender](/arcade/defender). Written by Søren Grønbech, it was inspired by [Dropzone](/commodore-64/dropzone) for the Commodore 64. As such, the exact gameplay deviates from [Defender](/arcade/defender) in that the task on each level is to carry the 8 pods through a portal, with points on completing a level for each one saved. The amount of points increases for each level: on levels 5, 9, 13 and so on, the player gets a new set of eight and the scoring resets. 
 
Like Grønbech's [Sword of Sodan](/amiga/sword-of-sodan), it made full use of the Amiga's hardware at a time when most games were direct ports from the Atari ST; the number of sprites moving smoothly around the screen is noteworthy. Some, including the Datastorm itself, cover almost the entire length of the screen.
