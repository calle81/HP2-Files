***Pac-Mania*** (パックマニア Pakku-Mania?) is an arcade video game in the  
Pac-Man series, released by Namco in 1987 and distributed by Atari Games  
in the United States and Europe. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware and  
was the last Pac-Man game to run on an arcade cabinet until 1996. 
 
 
 
 
The game was converted to most of the popular home formats of the time.  
These versions of the game were generally well received, especially on  
the 8-bit systems. The game was runner-up in the category of Best  
Coin-Op Conversion of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards, behind  
Operation Wolf.
