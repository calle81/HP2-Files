overview Rabio Lepus Special is an horizontal shooter and a remixed version of the arcade game Rabio Lepus originally released by V-System in 1987. In a faraway Kingdom, the king and his two daughters are happy and there is peace and harmony in the land. That is until one fateful day when an unknown spaceship appears like a bolt out of the blue and kidnaps the king and the two girls, all dressed in their bunny suits. The player assumes control of Usagi, a flying robotic-rabbit and his mission is to rescue the captives and eliminate their unknown captors. The rocket-powered rabbit comes equipped with a Vulcan gun and a set of homing missiles. Missiles are supplied in limited quantities and must be refilled frequently. Interestingly, Rabio Lepus Special doesn't reward the player with power-ups. Large carrot-cans are scattered around the levels and drop various items when destroyed such as carrots (life), money jars (points), missiles, raccoons (short invincibility) or a cute yellow hair bow (increases the missiles destruction power) - but nothing is available to boost up the main weapon. However, the rabbit's ultimate weapon are his fists and boxing gloves - when in close range, he can land a punch and inflict a lot more damage to the enemy. Rabio Lepus Special features six stages and three main locations - space station, asteroid and finally the planet surface where the enemy leader hides.
