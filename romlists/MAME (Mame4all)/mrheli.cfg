overview Mr Heli no Daib?ken is the conversion of Irem's shooter originally released in the arcades in 1987. It features a cute little orange helicopter with tiny feet. Thanks to these, Mr Heli can fly around the screen and also walk on the ground. All of this plays an important role in the game's mechanics - He can shoot straight in front of him (either left or right), or shoot missiles above him. However, when on the ground, the same action button instead drops bombs. The power-up system is very unusual and unique - blocks are scattered around every stage and they hide blue crystals, and the bigger they are, the more money they're worth. Special items (including a better gun, missiles, smart-bombs and energy tanks) are also hidden under these blocks and can be purchased in exchange of the precious crystals. Each level is split into three areas - first the main zone with a smaller boss awaiting at the end of it, then the player enters a sub-stage plunged in the dark where only his gun can get him to see what is ahead of him. The only way to get the light back is to destroy the nearby generator and rush all the way to the exit... to the boss' lair. Defeat him to complete the area and fly to the next stage !
