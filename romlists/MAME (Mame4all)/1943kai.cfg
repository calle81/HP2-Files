overview 1943 Kai is a vertical shooter and conversion of Capcom's popular arcade game originally released in 1987. This version was however developed by Naxat Soft and this port is essentially an enhanced remake of the original game. The action takes place during World War II and depicts the historic battle between the American and Japanese air forces in the Pacific. The player flies a Stearman biplane fighter plane and must destroy endless waves of enemy fighter planes, bombers and large battleships. The Stearman is equipped with a standard machine-gun that can be upgraded in all kind of ways. Formation of red enemy places drop special icons when defeated, and shooting at the same icons again loops through various power-ups and items, such as POW options (extra health), Shot Gun, 3-Ways, Super Shells, Lasers, Side Fighters or various special items such as the Double Pill (energy boost). The trademark Capcom special items are also scattered throughout the game, such as the Cow, the strawberry or the Yashichi (red and white twister/wheel shaped item) which gives the player an instant refill of energy. The second button is also used to release super-bombs that clean up the screen in exchange of some of the plane's energy, or make it loop in the air and avoid harmful enemy bullets. 1943-Kai features all the stages from the arcade game, as well as an original mode and a two player option.
