overview Battle Cross is an intense racing game published by Imagineer. The goal of the game is to take a small futuristic air bikes and to go around one of the various race tracks. Unsurprisingly, players actually race each other to see who makes it to the finish line first. To spice up the formula, power-ups and weapons are available for the taking throughout the game. These weapons dramatically change how the game is played altogether - the laser is unlimited and can stun other racers for a short amount of time, homing missiles fly around the track until they hit an unfortunate racer, invincibility gets the player to knock out anyone in its path, land mines, nitro speed boosts and so forth... A little fairy flies around each track and can relieve a player gone bad. Various hazards are also scattered around each track, from puddles to speed bumps, pinball bumpers and even cannonballs ! The game also features a battle mode where up to five players can race each other up and a solo story mode.
