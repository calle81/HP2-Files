overview Ribbit! is a one or co-operative two-player abstract arcade game and is an unofficial sequel to Konami's seminal 1981 release, Frogger.Unlike its legendary prequel (in which players had to guide a frog to his home at top of each screen without being killed) the aim here is to guide a toad around a screen, eating benign insects - such as Ants and Dragon-flies - while avoiding harmful ones - such as Spiders and Rats. A level is only complete once a set amount of insects have been eaten.Ribbit's stages take place over a number of different locations, including a sandy desert, a beach and - in tribute to the original game - on a fast flowing river with logs and turtles acting as platforms.Bonus points are awarded if a stage is completed within 60 seconds - with the amount earned dictated by how quickly the stage is completed. A bonus round also appears after every third stage, in which players must run over as many of either flowers or mushrooms as possible to make them bloom.
