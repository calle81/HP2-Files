overview Your task is to break Gravitar's hold on the 12 solar systems under his power. You can do this by destroying all bunkers on every planet or by setting off the reactor in the alien reactor base.Each solar system consists of a killer sun, an alien reactor base, and three or four blockaded planets - each housing fuel deposits and enemy bunkers.To move from one solar system to the next, you must either visit all the planets and destroy every enemy bunker or activate the reactor at the core of the alien reactor base and escape before it explodes.When you complete your mission in the three solar systems of one galaxy, you are automatically transported to another galaxy, where your rescue mission will continue.You start the game with 6 to 100 starships, depending on the game level, and with 10,000 fuel units. Your ship consumes fuel every time you use your thrust engines, activate your shields, or extend your tractor beam. A warning beep sounds when your fuel level goes below 2,000 units.The game ends when you run out of fuel or lose all your spaceships. When you complete your mission, the game resets and your points continue to accumulate.
