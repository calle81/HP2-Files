overview Dai Sen Puu is a vertical shooter, conversion of Toaplan/Taito's arcade game originally released back in 1989. The player controls a World War II fighter plane and must fly deep into enemy lines and destroy formations of tanks and other warships. Small trucks sometimes appear and release bonuses when shot: P (power ups), H (extra bomb) or flashing planes (extra life). A group of six planes can also be called to fly next to our fighter and shoot anything in sight. Pressing the bomb button twice drop a powerful bomb that cleans up a fair amount of the screen. Finally, Dai Sen Puu offers an unusual feature : levels do not pause between them and uncover instead a continuous flow of undisturbed shooting action.
