overview The player controls a red pirate ship that must raid across islands and the sea to capture a treasure chest of gold. Avoid the black enemy pirate ship and live volcanoes.There are seven different stages where you must steal a treasure from one of the infamous pirates including Captain Hook, Captain Kidd, Blackbeard, Long John Silver, Jolly Roger, Pegleg Pete, and The Mad Hackers. After all seven treasures have been captured, there is an intermission where an eye-patched skull and crossbones winks and grins and it says Yar! Har! Har! Har! Dead Men Tell No Tales! After that, the stages start all over again, but with increased difficulty. You have three ships at the beginning of the game and you are rewarded an extra ship at 90,000 points.
