overview Marchen Adventure Cotton 100% is a side scrolling shooter by Success and Datam Polystar, and likely sequel to the arcade game Cotton originally released in 1989. The cute witch and her flying broom are back in this exclusive adventure for the Super Famicom system. Cotton, the sweet-addicted witch, sets off on a long journey to save the country. Well, when the fairies plead with her for help, she genuinely misunderstood her real mission. As a result of her uncontrollable obsession with sugary candies, she now believes that she is in search of the Willow Candy. Cotton is accompanied by Silk, a cute fairy who helps her along the way and guides her through seven colorful stages. The witch can defend herself with magic powers - she can shoot blasts of energy from her magic wand, as well as drop bombs on the ground below. Unlike traditional shooters, the leveling and power-up system is based on experience points - several crystals must be collected for one level of power-up, and this number increases as Cotton becomes more powerful. She also comes equipped with several kinds of offensive magic spells (Fire Dragon, Thunder, Barrior, Bubbles and so forth). Their types can be changed at the beginning of the game (in packs of three), and they can be switched out during the game by pressing the shoulder buttons. These attacks come in limited quantities and special icons released by certain enemies can replenish them. Finally, up to three fairies can be rescued and join the fight, and holding the bomb button for a few seconds can send them hurling towards the enemy. In the Cotton tradition, each stage ends with the tea time bonus section where the player tries to collect as many falling teacups as possible within a time limit.
