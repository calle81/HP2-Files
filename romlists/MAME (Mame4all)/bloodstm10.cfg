USE YOUR HEAD OR YOU WILL BE DEADUp, Down, Up, Down, Up, Down, Up, Down, Block - BLOODSTORM VERSION X.XX* Fight Against Hidden Agents :1) GOLEM : In Subterra (the background with the cliffs on either side), there is a spike hanging down from the ceiling, suspended over the cliff. If you can knock down the spike, it falls into the pit. Then you just jump into the pit and you will not get spiked, you will stand on top of the fallen spike and enter through the door! To knock down the spike, you need to hit it twice with either your gauntlet or a projectile. Simply jump into the air and do the normal gauntlet throw move or whatever your projectile move is.2) DIMENTHIA : In the Obsel desert, on the ground, amidst all those symbols, there is a circular figure with five lines in it, like dividing a pie into five even wedges. Once the round begins, throw your gauntlet. You can jump and ditch it away, even. You won't need it. Move to the circular figure and do the move to pick up the gauntlet. The character will bend down and touch the ground. When the character touches the circular figure, a portal is activated and the character is transported to Triax, to fight Dimentia.3) CRANIAC : You get to him from the Black Armada background (This background is the one with a catwalk in the distance). Getting to the back platform is the key. Hold Block and move Up 2 or 3 times to jump back to the far away platform. Moving left or right makes you switch sides, down keeps you still and up or center makes you come right back to the front. To get to Craniac, jump back to the platform 3 times and hold down each time you get back there, in order to get as much time back there as possible. 5 seconds after returning from the third trip, a small Craniac will fly onto the platform. While he is there, jump back there again to be with him, holding down to wait there. The game will freeze and a message will come up stating that you will fight Craniac!4) WRAITH : he is found from the Scorch HQ background. You get to Wraith by entering a 'trash talk' password after you win a match on this background. The password is UP(x3), Block. If it done correctly, 'WRAITH SUMMONED' appears on the screen.5) RATCHET : On Nimbus, note the far left side of the platform... there is a line that separates the small edge part from the rest of the platform. This is the key. On the winning round, you must defeat the opponent so that either you or your opponent stays fully to the left of the line, in the edge part. Then, you enter a 'trash-talk' code : Hold Left, then Front Leg(x4), Block.6) SHADOW : Beat your opponent 2-0 from any background (no round 3 allowed, folks....without using the Block button in any match and do the fatality on BOTH rounds).7) BLOOD : Blood, like Shadow, can be found from any background. To fight Blood, you need to have a perfect round and then win the match. Note that if you get a Perfect in the first round, Blood will not appear until the match (win 2 out of 3) is over. If you do this, the dead opponent explodes and Blood comes alive!8) SIN : Beat all of the 8 regular fighters.* SPECIAL Ending : When you have beaten all of the regular fighters and all of the hidden agents, you will get to see the credits and at the end of the credits, a code and a telephone number is given to you :).
