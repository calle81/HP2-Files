overview TheBigL1 rates this game: 5/5This overhead run n' gun shooter has eight different characters you can play as, who all have different weapons and movement speed. 
Tapping the A button lets you sweep your shots with your guns, and you can hold the button to strafe. If you press B you'll do a rolling dodge, which you can use to evade enemy bullets. You press C to use your secondary weapon, which is very strong but has limited ammo. Each character has a different default gun and secondary weapon. 
Enemy attacks will deplete your health gauge, and if it drops to zero then you'll need to put in another credit to keep going. You can find food and first-aid kits to heal yourself, and before starting each level you get some health back. 
Special guns are found throughout the levels, and can be used until they run out of ammo or you get another gun. There are also pickups to replenish your secondary weapon, and attacking enemies in close-range will make them drop point bonuses. 
When starting the game you can use one character or a team of three. If you choose a team of three, you can press D during play to switch between them.
