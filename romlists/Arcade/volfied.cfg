overview The game principle is really simple: you must fill up the playfield (or more than 75%) and destroy the main Boss. You start at the bottom of the screen and your ship, when in motion, leaves a red trail (your ship won't move until you press II). Connect to another line (not your red trail !!!) and the enclosed area becomes yours. Any enemy contained within this area is then destroyed. Your ship is always protected by a shield, except when producing a trail... But pods are dotted around the field, enclose them and they will leave power ups: 'L' for lasers, 'S' for speed ups, 'T' will freeze all enemies for a time limit, 'C' will destroy all small enemies, '1up' for extra life, and the Star will give you a powerful laser !!!
