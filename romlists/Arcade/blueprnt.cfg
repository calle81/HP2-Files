overview The object of BLUEPRINT is to accumulate points by finding the parts of your contraption hidden within each neighborhood and successfully placing them in their propper positions on the blueprint for the contraption. Once the contraption is rebuilt, players must use it to stop the persuit of Daisy Damsel by Ollie Ogre. By doing so they will score bonus points and uncover clues to the hidden Password.In BLUEPRINT, you play the part of our gallant hero. You begin each game with three lives. The solid squares on the bottom of your screen indicate how many of your lives are left.Use your Joystick Controller to enter each neighborhood you encounter and to move from house to house. Hold the Joystick with the red button to your upper left toward the screen. As you search for the parts to fit the blueprint, the red button acts as your speed control. Once your completed contraption is activated, however, the red button becomes your triggering device, enabling you to fire off a shot at meen old Ollie Ogre.After having saved Daisy for the third time you will be awarded one extra life for being a true hero!
