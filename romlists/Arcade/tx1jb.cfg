overview TX-1 is a 1-player game with 3 color raster-scan video displays. Each speedway has 3 main stages : First Stage, Extended Stage, and Grand Prix Stage. The player will see mountains, deserts, skyscrapers against the skyline, dark tunnels, snow country, and meadows. The player drives a red Formula-1 race car. Upon completion of each stage, the player automatically enters the next one. Player controls consist of steering, shift, accelerator, and brake. The object of the game is to finish all three main stages.TX-1's new features are :*  3 video displays show the action of demanding and challenging speedways.*  4-channel sound simulates the realistic sounds of driving a race car.The game begins with the player's car behind the starting line with six other cars and with 70 game seconds showing on the clock. Racing hazards include sharp turns, roadside trees, other racing cars, and road signs. As the race progresses, more cars appear on the track. If the player's car hits another car, road sign, or tree while in HI gear, his car is destroyed in an explosion and racing seconds are lost. The player's car reappears and the race continues. If the player's car hits another car while in LOW gear, he will spin out.When approaching turns, the player must ease up on the accelerator pedal (or use the brake pedal) to make the corner. The player jockeys for position with the other racers, keeping his eye on the clock at the top center of the middle screen. When time runs out, the race is over. Upon completion of a stage, the seconds remaining are added to the next stage.The right screen displays the number of cars passed, using one star to represent each passed car.

The player should refer to the TX-1 Course Maps chart (located above the center video screen) for checkpoint and country locations.First Stage : This stage is comprised of Stage 1.
