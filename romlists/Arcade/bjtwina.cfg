overview Bomb Jack Twin is a direct sequel to the 1984 original, and retains the same platform-based collect-the-bombs gameplay of its predecessor.Changes over the original include a slightly faster playing tempo, and the option for simultaneous two-player gameplay. As with the original game, extra points and bonuses can be earned by collecting bonus coins and bombs with their fuses still lit.Bomb Jack Twin also retains the 'Powerball' feature of its predecessor which, when collected, freezes the level's enemies for several seconds, allowing them to be destroyed.
