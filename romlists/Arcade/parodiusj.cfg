overview Parodius Da! is an horizontal shooter by Konami and conversion of the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1990. This port can be best described as a parody (hence the name, PAROdy graDIUS) of Konami's classic shooter Gradius. Most of the very foundation and game mechanic that made the shooter so popular are reunited here with a humorous and imaginative twist. Interestingly, it isn't only their own franchises that Konami makes fun of, but other classics such as R*Type large mothership as well as myriad of creatures and legends borrowed from Japanese folklore. The player is given a choice to control one of four fighter ships - the trademark Vic Viper (from Gradius), a pink flying octopus, Twin Bee (from Twinbee) and a penguin called Pentar? (from Antarctic Adventure). The powerup system is largely borrowed from Gradius - a power meter at the bottom of the screen displays the current attainable upgrade which can then be activated at the press of a button (speed ups, missiles, options, shields and so forth). Power-capsules are left behind by red enemies and allow the player to select other upgrades from the power meter. Power bells, borrowed from Twinbee, are also here for the taking and activate various effects such as extra life, laser walls or invincibility which grows the ship to an enormous size for a short amount of time. This Famicom port of Parodius Da! features most stages from the original arcade game, an extra and exclusive carnival/toy fair level and several hidden bonus stages.
