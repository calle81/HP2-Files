overview Get your groove on! In this strange but addictive overhead shooter, you must do battle against hordes of enemy spaceships and giant motherships in order to rescue the hostages. Features colorful graphics &amp; awesome special effects, an ultra-cool 70's style soundtrack, plenty of options to customize your very own space fighter and the tried &amp; true gameplay from Atlus/Cave (which means LOTS of bullets to dodge!). Fans of excellent overhead shooters, as well as 70's music freaks should not miss on this party!
