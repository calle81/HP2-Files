overview One or two players take on the roles of Robo and Mobo, two cat-burgling brothers who must carefully make their way through a variety of scrolling platform-based levels, stealing a number of valuable items (as highlighted on a cut-away map displayed in the middle of the screen). Once all of the treasure items have been acquired, the brothers must quickly make their way to the roof to escape in a waiting airship. Each stage must be completed within a set time limit. Bonanza Bros. introduced a 3-D element to the traditional 2D platform gameplay. Both players and enemies can move between the front and back of the platforms, with the enemy guards having a 'field-of-vision'. This made it possible for players to hide from the guards by ducking behind furniture, as well as into alcoves and stairwells. If players get shot by the guards too many times, or if all of the treasure is not recovered and the escape point reached before the time limit expires, the brothers end up in jail and it's game over. Each of the game's ten stages is set in a different building the brothers have to burgle. These include a bank, a millionaire's mansion, a casino, a mint, an art gallery and a treasury.
