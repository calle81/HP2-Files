overview Cosmo Gang the Video is the conversion of Namco's arcade game. The game is highly inspired by Galaga, ultra famous shooter released by the same company in 1981. This version, however, features cute colorful graphics and froggy like characters instead of the traditional alien flying saucers. Formations of flying pink frogs and other weird aliens fill-up the screen and the player's task is to clean the whole thing up. Power-ups have also been added to the mix : shields, a jack-in-the-box that freezes everything on the screen for a limited amount of time, mine fields and giant-webs to slow down all enemies on the screen. The game counts five worlds and each of them features five sub-stages - the player simply needs to clean up all the baddies in each of them to jump to the next stage. A Challenge Stage awaits at the end of each world - in there, the player has to prevent the froggy like characters from stealing precious items, from mysterious crates to bags of gold. The only real boss of the game, Boss Cosmo, awaits at the end of the game after completing the fifth world. A two simultaneous player mode is available.
