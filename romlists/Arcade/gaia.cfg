overview A 1 or 2-player scrolling beat-em-up, with players selecting a character from a choice of 5; in which 2 'Elemental Warriors' must battle Satan and his army of demons that have captured and taken over the world. Each player-character possesses either Wind strength, Fire strength, or a mix of the 2.Gaia Crusaders is heavily influenced by another scrolling beat-em-up, Capcom's 1989 classic, Final Fight, and also, to a lesser degree, by Sega's legendary Golden Axe, also from 1989. The latter is particularly evident in the use of the Magical Attack, which acts as a smart bomb and is also identical to the magic attacks featured in 'Golden Axe'.Gaia Crusader's superb combo-geared control layout allows players to produce some highly impressive moves and attacks.
