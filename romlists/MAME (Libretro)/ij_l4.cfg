overview 1.00 play.- Fixed a problem in the complete all modes that could cause the mini playfield shots to not be collectable.- The Gun Trigger would not allow buy-in if player tilted on the last ball (NOTE : The Gun Trigger does not normally cause buy-in; it must be set that way by adjustment).- Drop targets are no longer cycled when the coin door is open. This prevents them from being marked bad because the interlock switch is open.- Fixed the third pass of Choose Wisely, which moved very slowly.Version L-7Date : November 22, 1993- Added a delay on switching the mini-playfield motor direction to help keep the motor from fatiguing.- Lengthened the firing time on the Path of Adventure up/down post coil.- Lengthened the firing time on the underplayfield trough post coil.
