overview Salamander is an horizontal shooter by Konami and conversion of their own arcade game originally released in 1986. The galactic entity Zelos is dangerously approaching planet Latis. The space monster's appetite is growing and he is devouring everything on its path. The player on board the Vic Viper and a partner on board the Lord British star fighter fly to Zelos's lair in an attempts to destroy the invader. This port of Salamander borrows its weapon system from Gradius - unlike the original arcade game which featured a more traditional and straightforward power-up system. A power-bar at the bottom of the screen displays available weapons and power capsules must be collected to activate them. There are six type of upgrades - speed up, missiles, ripple lasers, plutonic laser, options and shield. Options are at the core of the gameplay and mimic the ship's motion and attacks - they are also invulnerable and can withstand enemy bullets. However, losing a life also means losing all the painfully accumulated upgrades. The game features six zones and alternates between horizontal and vertical scrolling levels - they also all end with intense boss battles in the most venerable shooting traditions.
