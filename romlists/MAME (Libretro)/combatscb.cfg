overview Combat School is a one or two player multi-event combat game, similar in gameplay style to Konami's Track and Field series. * In the obstacle course, you must repeatedly press the fire button to run as fast as possible. Press the jump button in order to clear or mount hurdles of various heights. Complete the course within a specific amount of time to continue the game.* In the Iron Man race, the controls are the same but you will jump puddles and boulders and swim across a stream. * In the firing ranges, aim with the joystick or trackball and shoot using the fire button. There will be various firing range sessions beginning with stationary targets, proceeding to moving targets, and finishing with having to avoid hitting the targets that represent comrades. The comrade targets resemble your drill instructor but you must still avoid hitting them (the wrong targets and the drill instructors) as it will cost you the game. The activities get progressively more difficult as you proceed.
