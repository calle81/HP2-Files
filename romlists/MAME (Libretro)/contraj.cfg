overview Contra is a side scrolling action game by Konami and based on the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1987. In 2631, a mysterious meteoroid containing extraterrestrial life crashed through Earth's atmosphere and landed in New Zealand, near a group of islands. Two years later, a terrorist group organization known as the Red Falcon appears near the impact site and threatens to plunge humanity into destruction and chaos. The evil military group is believed to be helped by a malevolent alien race whose only purpose is to conquer the universe, and two elite commando marines (Bill Rizer and Lance Bean) are dispatched on a life-or-death mission to save the world. The fighters have the ability to jump, crouch, fire in eight directions and also move while using a weapon. They however have no shield energy nor life bar, and die in one hit. But the meat of the game lies elsewhere. Contra is popularly known for its serious fire-power on display, and although players start their mission equipped with a basic and ordinary rifle gun, more sophisticated and destructive weapons can be obtained throughout the game. Various large containers stamped with Red Falcon insignias on them release all kind of weapons with limitless ammo - Flamethrower (F), Laser Gun (L), Machine Gun (M) and 5-way Spread Gun (S). Special icons also give the players additional abilities, such as Rapid Fire (R) which increases the weapon's rate of fire, and the Barrier (B) which turns the player invincible for a short amount of time. Interestingly, although most of the game is played in a traditional 2D side-scrolling style of gameplay, the second and fourth levels switch to a 3D over-the-shoulder corridor perspective, and ask the players to fight their way through heavily defended rooms and corridors. Contra includes a two-player cooperative mode.
