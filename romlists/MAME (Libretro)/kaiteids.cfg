overview Kaitei Daisensou is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two-players. Each player takes control of a submarine and must shoot their way through the game's six levels as they are attacked from both beneath the water in which the submarine moves (by enemy subs, gun emplacements, mines etc.), as well from above the water-line, by boats, jet fighters and helicopters. Numerous power-ups can be collected to boost the sub's meagre fire-power. This is a superb game, created by the ame team behind the legendary R*Type series. The superbly-rendered graphics are very similar in style to Irem's R*Type Leo, released a year earlier. Kaitei Daisensou would prove to be Irem's last 'traditional' arcade shoot'em up, although two further R*Type sequels were released for home consoles (see R*Type Series section for more info).
