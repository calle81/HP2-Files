overview The second arcade sequel to 1990's Parodius Da!, this parody of Konami's Gradius series picks up where the first game left off. This time, it isn't only their own games that the Konami shoot-em-up mocks; other classics of the genre such as Irem's legendary R*Type - specifically the infamous mothership that forms R*Type's entire third level - are lovingly parodied.
