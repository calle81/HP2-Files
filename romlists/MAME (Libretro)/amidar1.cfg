overview Amidar is an abstract arcade game in which players must 'colour in' all of the rectangles on the screen. Each level has a number of patrolling enemies - or 'Amidars' - that must be avoided. Players are aided in their task with the inclusion of a JUMP button which, when used, causes all the on-screen enemies to jump; allowing the player time to escape from a close situation. There are only 3 'jumps' given per level, however.On even-numbered levels, the player's character is a gorilla; on odd-numbered levels, it is a paint roller. The Amidar enemies are savages and pigs, respectively.Filling the four corner boxes of the screen gives the player a short time in which to chase the Amidars and score extra points. In between levels, there is a chance to earn 5,000 bonus points. Here, a pig moves across the top of the screen. By pushing the jump button, the pig traces a path across the boxes towards the bottom of the screen. If the savage or pig reaches a bunch of bananas, a bonus is awarded.
