overview Kiki Kaikai is a top-down action game by Taito and conversion of their own arcade game originally released back in 1986. The protagonist of the game is a cute little girl called Sayo and her duty is to rescue her family members from the Dark World. Each stage is populated by creatures borrowed from Japanese mythology and folklore and Sayo must find the key hidden someplace in the area and guarded by a vicious boss. But Sayo Chan is not empty-handed and she has two weapons at her disposal - her magic duster-wand is quite effective in close combat but her long range magic cards are definitely the meat of the game. Flying ghosts, skeletons and zombies won't stand a chance against fully-powered magic cards and Sayo can upgrade them in many ways. Powerful magic balls can also be collected along the way and they can destroy everything on screen in the blink of an eye (press I and II simultaneously to release them). Finally, the game is far from linear and later stages offer different routes.
