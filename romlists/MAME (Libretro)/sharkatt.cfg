overview You are a deep sea diver in search of a fabulous treasure of diamonds that spilled from the hold of a Spanish galeon that sank during a fierce storm in the early sixteenth century.  You dive deep into the murky darkness of Dave Jones' Locker, and enter the shark-infested maze of kelp to retrieve the treasure.  You know your mission is rife with danger... the menace of the man-eating sharks that patrol the kelp beds... the lurking menace of the legendary Loch Ness monster, a beast that will pursue you relentlessly if you dare invade its territory.
