overview Valkyrie no Densetsu is an action/adventure game by Namco and conversion of the arcade game of the same name. A cute and courageous young Valkyrie is sent from heaven to save the country of Marvel Land. She is accompanied by Sandora, a green looking creature from the Sandora clan who is on a long journey in search of the Golden Seed, a magical artifact capable of granting all wishes. But the seed has only brought chaos and disaster to the world and Valkyrie is given the mission to find it and to destroy it before it falls into the wrong hands. With her sword and magic powers, she travels through six large areas - from swamps to rocky hills, deep caves and creepy dungeons. Coins can be collected along the way to purchase various items and new weapons from shops scattered (and sometimes hidden) around the game. The extensive list of items ranges from additional health containers, healing herb, wide beam shots, drill shots, four-way shots and so forth. Each special weapon only come in limited quantities though and disappears when it runs out of ammo. Valkyrie can also use her divine magic powers to cast powerful spells such as the multiple-valkyrie, the bomb or one that makes her grow to an enormous size. The game has somewhat of an adventure feel to it and each area has its share of special events that need to be resolved for extra bonuses. Other stages feature hidden villagers who ask the valkyrie questions and right answers are rewarded with special items or spells. Later stages also have a non-linear structure to them and different paths lead to different areas to explore. The game is vast and a password system allows the player to continue an earlier game.
