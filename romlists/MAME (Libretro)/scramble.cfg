overview Watch out for that next mountain! Maneuver your ship over a rough terrain in an effort to destroy the enemy base. Careful piloting alone won't get you to your destination... you must brave rockets, UFOs, flamoids and some very tight tunnels.  Few people have ever seen the enemy base, let alone destroy it. Will you be one of the select few?Your ship will immediately come into view and the landscape of the first part of your journey will begin moving beneath you. Use the joystick to maneuver your ship across the terrain, avoiding the mountains and other obstacles. Press button 3 to drop bombs. Press button 4 to fire lasers at the obstacles. If you are successful in piloting through that section of the terrain, you will immediately fly to the next, more difficult part of the planet. If you successfully travel through all levels, you will eventually reach the enemy base.
