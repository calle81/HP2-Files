	<name>1943 Kai</name>
	<desc>This is an enhanced version of 1942: The Pacific Air War, with most of the graphics and sounds reworked. There are also changes in the weapons and the inclusion of anachronical items such as laser-firing WWII planes and ships that run on ground. The player controls a biplane Boeing Stearman E75 N68828 instead of the P-38.

The PC Engine adaptation adds some original levels to those from the arcade version, as well as animated intermissions.</desc>

	<name>21 Emon - Mezase Hotel Ou!!</name>
	<desc>Naturally a manga/TV anime tie-in, 21 Emon is one of those Japanese style board games that have never really made a big impact in the west. Four players (any combination of human and computer) take it in turns to roll dice and move around the isometric board, landing on various event squares. The ultimate aim is to build as many hotels as you can and make more loot than your opponents.

	<desc>Similar to its predecessor, the premise of After Burner II is to get on the F-14 Tomcat and fly mission after mission of shooting planes out of the sky. At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</desc>

	<name>The Legendary Axe II</name>
	<desc>The Axe is back... with twice the force and twice the fury of 1989's "Videogame of the Year"! This time it's brother against brother locked in deadly combat. Your older brother has summoned unspeakable forces of evil to take control of the kingdom. Treachery rules! Your only hope is the legendary royal sword! But will its power be enough to overcome the Cliffs of Chaos? The Skull Dungeons? And the treacherous Crypts of Slime? Only your courage, your fighting skill, and the Legendary Axe can answer!

This game has you fighting monsters through seven stages with just a sword, but three other weapons can be picked up along the way, and include axes, chain spears, and smart bombs. These weapons can only be obtained by collecting the power-up that a defeated enemy leaves behind. Weapons can be switched along the way. At the end of each level, you must defeat a huge boss in order to go to the next stage.</desc>

	<name>Aoi Blink</name>
	<desc>The game is based-off an anime series of the same name which was the last television show developed by Osamu Tezuka, who died during the show's production. The anime is officially streaming, in its entirety, on Viki and Anime Sols with English subtitles.Unfortunately Hudson's Blue Blink game was never officially published in English but a translation patch was released by Gaijin Productions &amp; Zatos Hacks in 2001.GameplayThe protagonist, Kaeru (or Kakeru), travels across each world with a randomized pair of companions taken from the anime: Satch and Nitch, two rogues in striped suits; Tanba, the bus driver; and Princess Kirara, a spoiled royal who insists on following the party. Most of the levels have alternate exits, similar to Super Mario World, and the player has to search around for a special key in each world to unlock the final level, fight the world's boss and move onto the next world.Kaeru can use throwing stars to defeat his enemies, and each time he attacks his two companions also fire throwing stars. If the companions are standing in different places, the player receives more of a spread for their projectiles. If the player falls down a bottomless pit, they will be rescued by their blue pony friend Blink. Blink can only save the group in this manner a finite number of times, however. Blink is also involved with the boss fights: Kaeru mounts Blink and uses his powers to defeat each of these enormous foes.</desc>

It is operated by a drawing tablet peripheral named the "Illust Booster", which allowed users to draw directly onto the screen with a stylus similar to the art tablets of today, and another peripheral the "Print Booster", which allowed users to print their on-screen creations to paper as well the "Photo Reader" which worked as an image scanner. As well as a basic set of drawing tools, the player could switch between three music tracks to listen to as they worked. The game is a particularly rare and thus valuable HuCard to collectors, due to the number of equally rare and pricey peripherals that were sold along with it. Both the game and the peripherals command high prices on auction sites.</desc>

	<desc>Atomic Robo-Kid Special is a PC Engine adaptation of Atomic Robo-Kid, originally released by UPL for the Arcade in 1988. Unlike the versions released for other systems, which were all straight Arcade conversions, the PC Engine was rebuilt from scratch and thus carries the "Special" modifier in its title.The PC Engine version would never be released outside of Japan. GameplayAs with the standard Atomic Robo-Kid, the eponymous robotic war machine passes through a series of stages to find the exit. Each exit is blocked by a boss enemy, which often needs to be destroyed before the exit becomes accessible. Atomic Robo-Kid can collect up to three weapon upgrades and switch between them: if they lose a life, they lose the presently equipped upgrade but keep the others.The game will switch up how each stage is presented. The first two stages are side-scrollers, while others include a single-screen "duel" with a rival, a maze-like stage that the player explores in various directions and other divergences.</desc>

Unfortunately, this does not defeat the enemies, only disables them for a short time. After a few seconds, the enemies respawn and resume their chase of the player.

Gameplay is something of a Pengo variant, as the single-screen levels are inhabited by enemies, who can be killed by firing one of the balls at them at speed. When it hits one it will continue moving in the same direction, rebounding off walls if neccessary, and pushing you backwards slightly if it comes back to you - but it can be instantaneously brought back under control. Blocks can also be moved at a more casual speed, including round corners. Once a block is placed onto its spot, it can be used again as a weapon. The levels are in a maze style, and parts of this can be opened up. The game also includes a small bonus Kick-Ball game for 2 players, which doubles as practice with the control system.</desc>

	<name>Benkei Gaiden</name>
	<desc>For many years, monsters have been terrorizing the peaceful lands, until finally, the Buddhist priests known as the Dharma Eyes found a safe heaven in a secluded temple, where they raised young martial artists who would eventually liberate the people from the monsters. One day, one of these disciples was kidnapped by monsters and taken into their tower. The current Dharma Eye instructs another disciple, named Oniwaka, to venture towards the tower to the south and find a way to rescue his friend... and perhaps finally put an end to the monster invasion.

Benkei Gaiden is a traditional Japanese-style RPG, set in an environment reminiscent of Japan of the feudal epoch, with supernatural elements such as monsters etc. The player navigates Oniwaka on the top-down map, visiting towns, buying equipment (weapons and armor), and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Obviously, the game has been heavily influenced by the early Dragon Quest games; the interaction menu is nearly identical (the player has to bring up a menu and choose verb commands such as &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Search&amp;quot;, rather than perform different actions simply by pressing a button), and the general gameplay system does not deviate from the classic formula.</desc>

	<desc>The black spaceman kidnapped your beloved and brought her to his chambers in the castle, far beyond your reach, over the rivers, forest and mountains. Your job is to save her, battling the sea of the enemies, with only bombs at your disposal.

The range of explosion can be upgraded with time, but if you die, the range resets to minimum and you loose your previous skills, though. Some updates can make you walk through the walls, increase your speed, and give you some other assets to aid you in your quest to save the woman you love.

This top-down action-arcade game consists of nine levels per stage, each tougher than the other, and each final consisting of the boss you'll have to deal with. You can move horizontally and vertically and lay down bombs behind you thus evaporating the enemies, but beware, 'cos you can block yourself with your own bomb, and become a victim of your own tricks if you'll play in a huff.</desc>

	<name>Bomberman '93</name>
	<desc>Black Bomberman has cut power to the galaxy's own power station, which resulted in disputes between seven planets, and it is up to White Bomberman to restore power to the station and bring peace to the planets again. The objective is the same as in Dyna Blaster: use bombs to destroy all enemies in a level. Once you have destroyed them all, find the exit hidden in a block so you can be transported to the next level. A block will also flash yellow to let you know that a power-up can be obtained there. Power-ups include more bombs, manual detonation, extra lives, and extended flames. Occasionally, you also get the ability to walk through bombs or walls, or to kick bombs.

If you manage to reveal the exit before all enemies are destroyed, it remains in an "inactive" state, meaning that you cannot be transported to the next level until you blow up all the enemies and therefore making it "active". If you accidentally blow up the exit, whether it is active or not, or if time runs out, you will unleash a few enemies that you also need to destroy. After every eighth level, there is a boss that you need to destroy to proceed to the next planet.

Besides this Normal mode, there are two other modes: Battle and Versus. In Battle, you can play against four human- or computer-controlled players in one of seven stages, each with different features like warp holes, conveyor belts, revolving doors, and much more. In Versus, you play head-to-head against a friend using the TurboExpress for non-stop action. Regardless of these two modes, you can still obtain power-ups to give out some punishment against your fellow players, and the maximum number of wins can be set before play.</desc>

Referred to as a "digital comic", the game has a number of cutscenes that play out during the more dramatic parts of the game. The game also includes puzzles, including a sequence where the player recreates the face of a victim from memory using a number of facial features like scars and eyebrows.</desc>

	<name>City Hunter</name>
	<desc>City Hunter is based on the eponymous manga by Tsukasa Hojo. The story focuses on Ryo Saeba, a young man with a mysterious past, who founds the City Hunter team in Shinjuku, Tokyo. The City Hunter is an underground private detective agency, which takes care of particularly dangerous cases. In the game, the player is able to play through three of such cases, which are unrelated to each other and can be played in any order. 

The gameplay is essentially that of a side-scrolling shooter. The player navigates Ryo through the stages, dispatching of the frequently appearing enemies with his gun. The gameplay system is rather simple, without power-ups or different weapons, and with one items possible to carry at a time. The levels are usually designed as vast indoor areas, with many rooms Ryo can enter. The structure of the game also reveals mild adventure elements: often it is necessary to speak to a character, receive an item (such as a key), back-track to a previous area in order to reach a previously inaccessible room, etc.</desc>

	<name>Columns</name>
	<desc>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</desc>

	<name>Cyber Knight</name>
	<desc>In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</desc>

	<name>Darius Alpha</name>
	<desc>One of the rarest games for the PC Engine, Darius Alpha was only offered to those who bought both the CD and HuCard versions of Darius Plus (Which doesn't make much sense, considering how similar the two versions are). People who just couldn't get enough of Darius could now play another variation on the same theme. Darius Alpha is built on the same codebase as Darius Plus, but has been remodeled into a so-called "boss-fight" game, e.g. a game where you only fight the bosses of a game or game series. You start out with an unequipped ship and must take down the boss of the first level, King Fossil. Upon defeating King Fossil, you are granted some slight upgrades and proceed directly to the boss of the next level. And so on.</desc>

	<desc>Cratermaze is an action puzzle game viewed from an overhead perspective. Each stage consists of a maze filled with various enemies and items. You must collect all of the keys on the stage to open the exit door while avoiding or eliminating enemies. Your primary method of dealing with enemies is to dig holes; if an enemy walks into a hole, they are momentarily trapped and you can then fill the hole to kill the enemy.

You can also obtain temporary weapon powerups such as rayguns and yo-yos, as well as extend your digging reach to dig multiple holes at once. There are also several bosses encountered throughout the game.

The Japanese release, Doraemon: Meikyu Daisakusen, features popular children's character Doraemon and his friends. The game is a conversion of the 1987 Nichibutsu coin-op Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen, which also saw a modified Famicom version called Booby Kids.</desc>

	<path>./Double Dungeons - W (Japan).zip</path>
	<name>Double Dungeons</name>
	<desc>Double Dungeons is a solo dungeon crawler in the strictest sense. One or two players can explore pseudo-3D, maze-like dungeons (without auto-map feature, but with directions displayed on the screen) and fight the monsters populating them. The player(s) can choose to venture into any of the available 20 dungeons. The dungeons have the same textures, but their layout varies; the higher is the number of the chosen dungeon, the more dangerous are its enemies. Two-player mode features a split screen; the two players start exploring the dungeon from different points.

The basic gameplay is very simple. Enemies appear at specific points (they can also re-spawn), and must be defeated in order to proceed. The combat is turn-based at its core, though the turns follow very quickly, and the enemies will attack even if the player does nothing. Attacking is done simply by pressing a button; there are no other combat options. 

The player can find equipment and healing items (which can also be dropped by enemies). These can be used to restore the player character's HP outside of battles. Leveling up is completely automatic.

There is no narrative in the game; the only story-related information comes in form of very short text intros to the different dungeons, along the lines of "the king wants to retrieve a treasure and sends a warrior into the dungeon" or comparable mission objectives.</desc>

He has conquered this land and plunged it into an age of terror and despair, plagued with violence. It is up to you to stand against him and return your world to its former glory.

Dungeon Explorer plays like Gauntlet: you choose one of several different characters to play as (Fighter, Thief, Warlock, Witch, Bard, Bishop, Elf and Knome) and set out on your adventure alone or with up to four other players. Battles are real-time and of the shooter variety, ie, rather than swing a sword, you fire knives (or spells depending on your class). Enemies respawn out of holes in the ground which must be eradicated to keep them from pouring forth in waves. There are a number of items to be found and used throughout the game including potions of white and black magic, healing drinks and the like, but unlike Gauntlet there is no food to worry about.</desc>

A scientist who possesses the secret knowledge of psychic powers known as ESP, imbues a young boy with them, and sends him to the streets and underground caverns of Tokyo, to rescue the few remaining survivors, and find out the source of the monstrous invasion!

Energy is a side-scrolling shooter. The player manipulates the young hero, who can shoot energy balls and jump. The energy attacks deplete his ESP bar, which refills itself gradually afterwards. The hero's life bar can only be refilled with healing potions which are sometimes dropped by the enemies. The boy can also collect items which change the properties or his ESP attack, and/or upgrade these attacks to the next level.</desc>

	<name>Fighting Run</name>
	<desc>Fighting Run is an action game by Nihon Bussan that features an unusual mix of racing and fighting. The player takes control of a humanoid biped robot engaged in a series of deadly races against other opponents. But these races have a twist - each racer can attack the opposing player in order to win the race and score points. In single-player mode, the player first needs to choose a track and an opponent. Then points need to be allocated to increase various abilities, from Speed, Power to Armor. Then the race is ready to go - each racer can freely move around the track, hit each other or use special attacks collected along the way (such as lightning bolts, grenades and so forth). Each robot also comes with a life bar and the race is over as soon as it reaches zero. Additionally, Fighting Run features a versus-mode where two players, or two AI controlled opponents, can race against each other, as well as a tournament-mode where eight robots and their pilots race (two at the time) for a golden trophy.</desc>

	<desc>Final Lap Twin is an open-wheel F1-style racing game loosely based on Namco's Final Lap arcade game.  The game display is always in split screen mode, even if only one player is playing.  The other display shows your nearest rival if you are racing against the computer.

There are two basic modes: Grand Prix and Quest. Grand Prix consists of a multi-race points championship. There are two car types for this mode: F-3000 and F1. Grand Prix mode can be played with one or two players.

Quest mode has more depth and forms the core of Final Lap Twin. This is essentially a racing RPG. You take the role of a boy who desires to become the World Champion. To do so, you must travel from town to town finding challenges and winning them to gain money and special items to improve your car. As you move around the game world, which is presented in an overhead view, you will encounter random challenges, much like random battles in a traditional RPG.</desc>

	<name>Gaia no Monshou</name>
	<desc>Gaia no Monsh? (also known as the 'Crest of Gaia') is a fantasy round-based strategy game by NCS and conversion of a game originally released for the NEC PC-8801 in 1987. The Light and Dark forces are engaged in a fierce war and Böser, leader of the Dark Army, is now ready to capture the Rall Tower, source of the world's energy. Sieghart, leader of the Light army, is the only one who stands between the evil Böser and the complete decimation of the kingdom. Gaia no Monsh? is a turn-based strategy game at heart - the player moves troops around a battlefield and attacks nearby enemy units. An Auto Battle mode is also available and gives the option to let the AI figure out of the player's next move. The game offers several play modes - the first one (Scenario Mode) gives the player the chance to jump straight into battle using predefined troops. The second (Construction Mode) allows him to build his own army using unit points. The last one (Campaign Mode) conveys story plot elements and starts in the siege town of Dirl, where king Sieghart battles the fierce Böser. This mode requires more complex strategy and the player must assemble his own troops using unit points and units lost in battle don't come back during the campaign. Unlike the other two modes, it offers a password system to save the player's progress through the game.</desc>

	<name>Galaga '90</name>
	<desc>Galaga '90 is a port of the arcade game Galaga '88.

Galaga '90 takes the basic gameplay of Galaga and adds nicer graphics, triple ship abilities, parsec progression, power-ups, asteroids, bosses and other enhancements.

Periodically the player encounters Challenging Stages, which are set to music and feature "dancing" enemies. The objective is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points.

There are a total of 29 stages. You can begin with 1 ship with 2 in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in reserve). 

Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to destroy. 
Some enemies explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that "wiggle" their way down the screen. Some enemies arrive in spherical "eggs" and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen. Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies. 

Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. 

In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.</desc>

Different stages may have different goals -- for example, you may have to find a key, or use your surround ability on floor tiles to reveal items or enemies. Only your snake's head is vulnerable; if an enemy hits your body it will scatter all the pieces and you'll have to collect them again. After completing set conditions on each stage, a door will open that leads to the next stage, at which point you'll be just a head again, and will have to hunt for your body once more.

The game has the same unique UPL style that will be familiar to fans of games such as Atomic Robo-Kid and Mutant Night.</desc>

In each scenario, the Serds - a league of specialized attack mecha - are deployed from their HQ ship Altea. The Serds all have single-letter code-names and different specializations: for example, the G-Serd wields a laser sword for devastating melee attacks and can move quickly, while the B-Serd is capable of long-range mortar attacks but has limited movement. The eponymous X-Serd is the most powerful of the team.</desc>

The game makes a linear progression from stage to stage, losing the world map from the original as well as the upgrade buying between levels (since "Doc" the inventor of both cyborgs and provider of upgrades has been abducted by the aliens), although new shooter stages have been included to spice things up.</desc>

Your partner doesn't like this one bit, so he decides to make a nuisance of himself along the way. Similar to Adventure Island, you must make your way through several levels, destroying wildlife along the way, but instead of using a hammer, you have three different ways to kill them: jump on or kick them, or when they are walking on the ground, blow gas out of them. 

While scrolling through the level, your vitality will decrease, but it can be restored by collecting fruit and junk food. During your travels, you will also encounter your partner doing things that shouldn't be done in public, but sometimes, he will throw stuff at you to make you lose some of your vitality. The only way that you can deal with him is by kicking him where it hurts.

Along the way, you can enter doors. Doing this will give you a hint about the level and your vitality will be increased as well. You can kick certain objects such as lamp posts, trashcans, or thin air to obtain coins, or to make hidden platforms appear. Coins can be used in slot machines that will give you extra vitality, more lives, extra coins, and more. Slot machines only appear when you enter certain doors.</desc>

These characters also include the two protagonists from the Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman series: Tasuke and Kyapiko (or Arnold and Sonia, as they're known in Shockman). Each team also has an assigned stadium that fits their theme: the seal team, for instance, have a stadium with an ice-like floor.</desc>

Kore ga Pro Yakyuu '90 is a traditional 16-bit baseball game. The camera is positioned behind the batter, with cutaways showing other players on the bases. The pitching player can also use this view to change the formation of their fielders before the next pitch. Once the ball connects with the bat, the view switches to a distant top-down view so that the player can manage their fielders.</desc>

Getting power-ups will make the fireball soon increase to a strange "bouncing" fireball, which will provide more damage to enemies. Treasure chests can be busted open, allowing Tommy to collect coins. Tommy's journey will have him explore ruins, cliffs, statues, dungeons, and finally the castle. At the end of each of these, there is a boss that must be defeated in order to proceed to the next stage.</desc>

The enemies, not to be outdone by a ten-year-old girl, shall retaliate by firing marbles at her (which can cause her to fall over the edge of the platforms unless they are avoided or jumped over) - and though the game credits E. Shitara as Alice's voice, the only time you hear her voice is when she says "OW!" after taking a hit. The seventh, eighth and ninth worlds are also palette-swapped versions of the second, fourth and first ones respectively which suggests that they must have been added later in the game's development to pad it out a bit; however, they feature different enemy types (and bosses). In 1998, the Naniwa (the game's equivalents of Tweedledee and Tweedledum) went on to lend their name to one of the new stadiums (the Naniwa Dome), for the Namco System 12-era World Stadium games - however, they did not appear in the Namco All Stars' lineup.</desc>

Idols can be broken to reveal power-ups that will increase the axe's power and speed up its swing. These power-ups can also award you extra lives, more points, and the ability to access secret areas. At the end of each zone, you have to defeat a boss in order to proceed.</desc>

	<desc>Somer Assault is a difficult to describe game.  In it you control a pink slinky character with guns attached to it.  You move around mazes, climbing on walls, on the ceiling, through shortcuts, and attempt to find you way to the end.  Along the way, you have to shoot out many, many enemies.  And at the end, you will find a nasty boss surprise.

The story is bizarre, which fits the concept of the game. A sorceress has plans to rule the world. To do so, she has summoned 12 beasts, each based on a sign of the zodiac. It up to you, pink slinky, to defeat the 12 astrological signs.</desc>

Momotaro Katsugeki seems influenced by and plays similarly to Westone's Wonder Boy in Monster Land and the sequels that followed: the goal is to move across a set of 2D stages, and the player can talk to NPCs for hints and to purchase better equipment with the money they find.

	<desc>Necros no Yousai, or Neclos no Yousai, ("Fortress of Neclos/Necros") is a traditional Japanese RPG that was released exclusively on the PC Engine. It is based on the toyline of the same name, which was one of many brands of "shokugan" or "food toys" - small figurines packaged with candy that were intended for children. The toyline featured the evil sorcerer Neclos/Necros, the eight heroic champions sent to defeat him and Neclos/Necros's various henchmonsters.

The game controls like a standard RPG and alternates between a top-down view for talking to NPCs and exploring towns and dungeons and a first-person view for its turn-based combat. The various characters launch into little animated vignettes whenever they attack, and each of the heroes has strengths and weaknesses specific to their class which the player can build strategies around.</desc>

	<desc>Military Madness is a futuristic turn-based strategy war game.  The year is 2089 and the setting is Earths moon, which yields many important resources.  While the governments of Earth bicker over their staked claims on the moon, the evil Axis Empire launches a lunar military campaign and takes over the moon, using its factories to produce advanced weaponry, the most devastating of which is the SAM (Supreme Atomic Missile).  As commander of the Allied forces, it is the players responsibility to lead whats left of the Allied armies in a desperate offensive against the Axis Empire on the lunar surface before they can use the SAM to destroy Earth.

There are 32 maps (2 different campaigns with 16 maps each) to play through. In each map, the player must strategically defeat the outnumbering Axis forces either by destroying all enemy units or capturing the enemy base camp. There are many different units that both sides utilize - infantry, tanks, aircraft, artillery, and a few others that have specialized functions. Gameplay consists of moving units into positions that will gain the best advantage to attack the enemy, capitalizing on many factors, which include battle experience, terrain, support tactics, and - sometimes - pure luck.</desc>

It appears that once Dirth way sealed by eight wise men who used the power of eight sacred medallions. Princess Aurora is the only one who knows how to use those medallions, and that is why Dirth abducted her! You must explore the land, descend to the dangerous labyrinths, retrieve the eight medallions, rescue the princess, and defeat Dirth.

Very similar to the famous Zelda games, "Neutopia" is Turbo Grafx' answer to Nintendo's king of action adventures. You roam freely the vast land, fighting many different monsters in wilderness areas as well as in dungeons. Dungeons also require some puzzle-solving (pushing stones, blowing walls with bombs, etc.). The game has a slight RPG flavor, allowing you to power-up by collecting various items, and equip different weapons and armor.</desc>

But there are still monsters roaming the countryside, and some of them were spotted near Yurius Shrine. Jazeta went there to find out what exactly had happened. But he didn't return... You are Jazeta's son, and you must first of all find your missing father! Can it be that the shadow of Emperor of Darkness threatens the peaceful land again?..

The sequel to "Neutopia" is similar to the predecessor in every way. Navigating your hero from a top-down view, you explore the vast countryside, fighting monsters in real time combat. The game is not a true RPG, but an action adventure: you don't gain any experience points from combat, only collect money to buy supplies. In dungeons, you must use bombs on walls to reveal secret passages, push stones, and fight many regular enemies and bosses.</desc>

	<name>The New Zealand Story</name>
	<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

	<name>Ninja Gaiden</name>
	<desc>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which 2 ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.

Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</desc>

	<desc>Two player side scrolling beat-em-up converted from the Taito coin-op that featured three monitor screens side by side. The Amiga version was developed in letterbox format in order to show as much of the wide screen background graphics as possible. 

The player(s) controlled robot Ninjas, which battled their way through the levels using Shuriken and knives. As the Ninja's took damage their classic Ninja garb was torn away to reveal robotic limbs, torso or head. When the damage reached critical the Ninja Robot would explode, scattering mechanical body parts.

As with The Sales Curve's later title SWIV, The Ninja Warriors used the company's Dynamic Loading System to load sprites, sound and background graphics from disk on the fly.</desc>

	<desc>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?

Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. 

You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. 

Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</desc>

During gameplay, players can obtain crystals that can be used to buy special weapons, extra lives, and other power-ups at shops located throughout the levels. There are also a bonus games that allow players to win multiple crystals or points by shooting at rotating targets.

	<path>./Out Live (Japan).zip</path>
	<name>Out Live</name>
	<desc>A very important discovery was recently made on the planet Laffra - ancient ruins at an excavation site, containing relics of another civilization, with technique that would surely benefit the great intergalactic Empire. But a mysterious organization that calls itself "Mars" began to stir unrest on the planet. The head of Imperial Scouts sends the hero, piloting a combat robot known as "FW", into the depths of the ruins, to face the enemies and retrieve the precious knowledge...

Out Live is a solo dungeon crawler; unlike most representatives of this genre, it is set in a sci-fi environment, and the player controls a giant robot rather than a medieval warrior. Most of the enemies are also machines and robots of different kinds. 

Before venturing into the dungeon, the player has access to various shops, where it is possible to repair the robot, buy weapons, protective shields, and items that restore the robot's energy. Most of the gameplay takes place in pseudo-3D, maze like underground complexes (without an auto-map, but with a compass feature). There, the game plays similarly to other dungeon crawlers: random enemies must be fought in turn-based fashion; they drop money and award the player character with experience points.

A somewhat unusual feature is "double leveling": the robot has two independent levels, for attack and for defense. The experience points the robot receives after battles also come in two different flavors. Depending on the enemy type and outcome of the battle, the robot receives different amounts of experience. The leveling-up itself is automatic, increasing maximum energy, attack and defense parameters.</desc>

When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

Thankfully your mind has created the ultimate weapon: a ship with which you can navigate the five causes (stages) and blast back the Devil's evil minions. It is your only hope, your one last chance to free your mind from this evil influence.

Psychosis is a side-scrolling shooter where each level is meant to represent a different location within your mind. One looks like the sky, another filled with aquatic plants, one with what resemble tetris blocks. It is within these stages that you must blast everything in sight while collecting power ups to upgrade your weapon and shield. You can gain two floating balls that resemble mechanical eyes and can be directed 360 degrees around your ship to either act as a shield or to direct your weapon. Battle your way through each stage and defeat the boss at the end and eventually you'll do battle against the very DEVIL himself.</desc>

	<name>Air Zonk</name>
	<desc>In 1992, Hudson Soft expanded upon the Bonk's Adventure franchise they had built by creating Air Zonk, a 2D side-scrolling "cute 'em up" shooter set in a cyberpunk-esque future. While Air Zonk differed from its successor in terms of gameplay, the cartoonish style of the Bonk series could still be seen all throughout the game, especially in the graphics, the characters, &amp; of course, Zonk himself.

Air Zonk may appear to feature a candy cartoon coating on the outside, but it's still a traditional shoot-'em-up at heart. You still have a selection of your basic weapon power-ups (8 in total here), but spread guns &amp; powerful bursts are now represented by killer decks of cards &amp; giant metal mandibles. Large, imposing endbosses are still the norm, but here your foes range from giant heaps of living garbage to killer football players. And outer space? Who needs to blow up things there when you have other venues (5 in total) such as a gigantic stadium to do it in?

In addition to all of this, Air Zonk gives you a feature that allows you to choose from one of 10 "friends" at the beginning of each level who will fight by your side once you pick up a certain power-up. These friends range from giant scud missiles to living dump trucks to floating cow-things, among others. Pick up another power-up, &amp; Zonk &amp; his friend combine to create a powerful hybrid form, featuring some of the strangest attacks you may ever see in a video game.

So will Zonk be able to defeat King Drool, rescue the moon from his clutches, &amp; save the world? As usual, the answer is up to you...</desc>

	<name>Populous</name>
	<desc>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness. Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on. The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero. He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy. When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people. He will burn; he will kill. And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well. You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers. Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland. Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer. A god's play is just never done.</desc>

	<desc>Ever wanted to race dune buggies at high speed on a variety of tracks? Power Drift is an arcade racer that gives you the chance to do just that.

There are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans. 

Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. Youll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While youre buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. 

Finish all 5 stages in a level and youll be presented with a bonus level.</desc>

The fighter plane starts with a simple and slow vulcan gun which can be upgraded during the game by destroying flashing enemies, often in the shape of planes or missiles. Other power-ups are also available, like ground bombs or energy-cells restoring one of your plane shield bar. However, your fighting plane can also carry a secondary weapon. There are six of them including Homing missiles, Napalm Bomb, 8-ways and even one interesting option which will mirror your plane and triple its fire-power. This secondary weapons are triggered using the other action button, they can be collected in the same way the other items are and can be stocked up. </desc>

A new battle android called "Aura" was developed and sent into battle, and seemed to be leading its country to victory. However, Aura broke free of human control and revolted against the Earth, taking control of the other androids and starting a war against humanity. In a last ditch effort, humanity developed one more android, stronger than any before and imbued with the wishes of humanity, dubbed "Psycho Chaser." It is making its assault on Aura's stronghold to end the war.

Psycho Chaser is a vertically-scrolling sci-fi shooter. The player takes control of the titular battle android. There are multiple weapons which can be picked up and freely switched between, and also power-ups which allow for weapon and energy upgrades between stages.</desc>

	<name>Puzznic</name>
	<desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

A pilot must take control of the experimental fighter to destroy the alien warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks and planes with gadgets attached to them. 

Raiden (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing). You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.</desc>

Of course, this future society craves dangerous entertainment, so the whole thing has apparently been turned into some sort of television show for the entertainment of the masses; most of the enemies are likely placed by the makers of the show to increase the entertainment value for viewers.

	<name>R-Type</name>
	<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>

	<desc>Sadakichi Seven: Hideyoshi no Ougon is a menu-driven adventure game that focuses on a silly James Bond style story of an evil organization known as N.A.T.T.O. (natto is a regional Japanese dish) and a chef-like spy determined to stop them. Several allusions to the 007 franchise are made throughout the game, including an opening cutscene viewed from the barrel of a gun and the hero casually tossing his hat onto a hat rack as the game begins.

Besides the odd narrative elements, it plays much like any Portopia-derived adventure game: The player can interact with their environment through a list of commands on the right side of the screen and the goal is to talk to NPCs, explore the surroundings and discover clues in order to solve a mystery.</desc>

As with most other Mahjong simulators, this is an accurate portrayal of the classic Chinese board game, complete with detailed tiles and animated character portraits. It is four player, though two players are obscured by the sides of the screen (the player can move the camera to see their tile walls, but not the tiles themselves). As per usual Mahjong rules, the first player to put together a winning hand - either from the tiles they collect at the start of each turn or the discarded tiles of other players - wins the game.</desc>

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on, as well as featuring 5 preset challenges, some of which have time limits of 5 or 10 minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</desc>

	<desc>This might look like a typical drop-the-block puzzle game, but there?s a twist (or spin) to it. Instead of just matching block colours, you also have to fill in the blocks by rotating their ?full? half so it matches the ?empty? half of the shape below. As levels progress, blocks represent different things like plants, animals etc to give some variety. There are several modes of play, including a story mode and link-up.</desc>

	<desc>This coin-op conversion of Splatterhouse is the second game in the series (after Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti on the NES) which was later continued on the SEGA Genesis.

Rick and his girlfriend Jennifer enter West Mansion (known as Splatterhouse) to study Dr. West's parapsychology teachings for a school project. After a flash of lightning and a scream, Jennifer is gone, and Rick is left wearing the Terror Mask, which gives the wearer great strength.

Rick must survive seven blood-soaked levels full of corpses, demons, and other disturbing creatures in this arcade side-scrolling beat-em-up. Several weapons are at Rick's disposal throughout the house, such as a meat cleaver, a two by four, and a shotgun. If Rick wants to find Jennifer alive, he must move quickly through the floors of the mansion.... as a happy reunion is not always guaranteed.</desc>

	<name>Super Momotarou Dentetsu</name>
	<desc>Super Momotarou Dentetsu is a train and conveyance-based board game with financial elements that features Hudson's Momotarou character, based on the Japanese folklore hero of the same name. It is the second game in the Momotarou Dentetsu series and the first to be released on a 16-bit console - the PC Engine - hence the "Super" in the title. Several years after its PC Engine release, Super Momotarou Detetsu was also released on the Nintendo Famicom and Game Boy. It received a sequel in Super Momotarou Dentetsu II and a large number of successors.

The goal of the game is to travel the map and acquire territory through business deals, similar to Monopoly or Itadaki Street. Players have to contend with each other for limited resources, as well as CPU threats like the God of Poverty.</desc>

The games focus on each player's burgeoning real estate corporation, allowing the players to take turns and move their trains around the board to buy properties and trade resources. It plays similarly to the Parker Brothers board game Monopoly or the Itadaki Street games.</desc>

Choosing normal game pits the player against the computer in a single game. Choosing World League pits the player against all other teams available. A password save is available in this mode.

The game features eight national teams (USA, USSR, Brazil, Holland, France, Italy, Japan and China), with fictitiously named players. Players can be changed during gameplay by pressing C. There is also an option to create new teams, choosing the team's name, color, player's position and names.

Gameplay is viewed from a side scrolling perspective, with the camera fixed on the ball. A small radar on the top of the screen shows the players' positions of both teams. Players can, bump, set, spike, dump, block and dig. A collection of serves is also available: underhand, overhand and jump serve. There are also options for three ball speeds, beginning points (from 0 to 10, out of 15) and handicap.</desc>

	<name>Susano O Densetsu
</name>
	<desc>Susano-o Densetsu (alternatively romanized as Susano Oh Densetsu, or "Legend of Susano Oh") is a strategy RPG for the PC Engine that was based on the Go Nagai comic Susano-o. Like another of Nagai's more famous works, Devilman, the hero of Susano-o is a regular Japanese high school student that discovers an awesome and terrifying power within himself and struggles to keep it under control. Rather than a demon, this power is that of the Shinto deity Susano-o who is reimagined as a legendary world-destroying giant.

The game is loosely based on the story of the manga, which was never actually completed. The player controls Susano-o in his awakened form and travels a post-apocalyptic world to track down and defeat the demons who had caused the world's end. While in towns the player can talk to NPCs, acquire quests, rest at inns and purchase items and equipment from vendors. On the world map between locations, the player can see monsters roaming around (not unlike Zelda II: The Adventure of Link) and will enter combat if they get too close. These fights are entirely tactical and require that the player move around an invisible grid and use the fight command on enemies in range; as the player levels up, they will gain more action points and will be able to attack and move more often per turn.</desc>

You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".</desc>

Everyone who was invited to the wedding begins to celebrate when, suddenly, the evil Baron Bronsky appears and snatches Tina away, while his henchmen take the six children away. To reach his castle and rescue Tina, Master Higgins must first rescue the six children, each of whom is hidden on a separate island.

New Adventure Island is a one-player action game that consists of seven areas, with four rounds each. In order to get through the areas, you must use your hatchet to destroy wildlife such as frogs, spiders, birds, snails, insects, and other pests, and watch out for hazards such as rocks, fire, water, and pits. 

As you progress further, your vitality will get low, so fruit must be collected in order to restore it. Along the way, you can smash open eggs that will award you with better weapons that include boomerangs, arrows, and magical fire. Some of the eggs will also reveal a fairy, which will protect you from getting hit. If you are unlucky enough to find an eggplant hidden in one of these eggs, your vitality will drain away very fast, and you need to get fruit every five seconds in order to survive.

When you get to the end of an area, you will have to defeat one of the henchmen and rescue a child from one of the four castles.

An update of the original NES game.</desc>

	<path>./Titan (Japan).zip</path>
	<name>Titan</name>
	<desc>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.

For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.

The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key  a very useful option in tricky situations.

Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.</desc>

	<desc>This arcade conversion is a  beat 'em up in which you (as Lee Wong) must rescue the village children from the evil Ryo Ken Oh. Many levels are horizontally scrolling, although with high ledges to jump onto and follow for a slightly different path. Magic urns containing improved weapons appear frequently. Most enemies are easy to attack and only need one hit to kill, although they come at you in large hordes. Once you get to the indoor sections you will find big enemies with the ability to kill you with one hit, in sections set on multiple levels complete with stairways.</desc>

	<desc>This is a remake of the original game. The story still's the same: Ishtar sends Gilgamesh up the 60 maze levels of the Druaga's tower to rescue Ki and retrieve the Blue Crystal Rod. He must find each level's key to proceed to the next one.

Besides the updated graphics, this remake features a 3/4 view instead of the original top-down one. It also bears some RPG elements, as Gilgamesh gathers experience points for killing enemies, which are spent at the end of each level, to improve his stats (such as speed, health, etc.). He'll also find equipment such as swords, helmets, armors, shields, gauntlets and boots, which can be changed to better his stats, and will also find special items in hidden chests. The way to find theses chests is different for each floor. There are new treasures and new enemies.

The game also features four different difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard and pro), as well as a password feature.</desc>

The plot in the game is not real clear according to the instruction booklet. Apparently something called a "Sinistron" has invaded your quadrant of the galaxy and you have to blow it up, just because.

This game has large enemy sprites and large boss characters. The levels take place mostly in outer space and alien environments. Some of the sprites are Macross-like mechs.

	<name>Volfied</name>
	<desc>Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late '80s. The game is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along.

The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points.

As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.</desc>

Set in the stage of the "Namco Theater", the game plays as an action side-scroller in which you progress across each stage kicking the snot out of all the enemies you run across. By collecting the right power-up you can transform into Wonder Momo for a limited time, who can perform ranged attacks with a hoola-hoop and is more powerful than regular Momo.

Not only must you clear the enemies of each stage, but also please the crowd with your performances, being wary of perverts that attempt to take pictures of your underwear whenever you attack (Momo shows quite a bit of leg whenever she "kicks high") which results in blinding flashes that stun Momo and leave her open to an attack.</desc>

The game has three difficulty modes which determine the amount of enemies and their health: Beginner, Normal and Expert.
Each power-up provides a different weapon to the player depending on the color, and collecting subsequent power-ups increases the power of that weapon. If the player switches colored power-ups, they'll acquire the stronger versions of those power-ups. If the player gets hit, they'll lose the current power-ups they have; if they don't have a power-up, they'll lose a life.</desc>

The goal is to make it to retirement with the most assets. The player can also get married, have kids and experience various other important life changes, but the primary goal is the acquisition of funds. The player is also able to invest funds and gamble, the outcome of which is dependent on pure luck.</desc>

	<name>Zipang</name>
	<desc>Zipang is a puzzle game released exclusively for the PC Engine in 1990. It is based on the movie of the same name (which in turn is an antiquated word for the nation of Japan): a comedy action movie from director Kaizo Hayashi that was loosely based on Japanese mythology and was also released in 1990. The same movie would also be the inspiration for the NES game Kabuki Quantum Fighter, which in Japan was named Jigoku Gokurakumaru: the name of the movie's protagonist.

Zipang plays similarly to Solomon's Key/Solomon no Kagi by Tecmo. The player character can destroy and place blocks, using them as platforms to get higher up in the stage. The player needs to remove enemies in their way and collect necessary items along the way to the exit. After each stage, a prefecture of Japan is placed on a map of Japan: upon completing them all, the game is over.</desc>

At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</desc>

This game has you fighting monsters through seven stages with just a sword, but three other weapons can be picked up along the way, and include axes, chain spears, and smart bombs. These weapons can only be obtained by collecting the power-up that a defeated enemy leaves behind. Weapons can be switched along the way.

The anime is officially streaming, in its entirety, on Viki and Anime Sols with English subtitles.Unfortunately Hudson's Blue Blink game was never officially published in English but a translation patch was released by Gaijin Productions &amp; Zatos Hacks in 2001.GameplayThe protagonist, Kaeru (or Kakeru), travels across each world with a randomized pair of companions taken from the anime: Satch and Nitch, two rogues in striped suits; Tanba, the bus driver; and Princess Kirara, a spoiled royal who insists on following the party. Most of the levels have alternate exits, similar to Super Mario World, and the player has to search around for a special key in each world to unlock the final level, fight the world's boss and move onto the next world.Kaeru can use throwing stars to defeat his enemies, and each time he attacks his two companions also fire throwing stars. If the companions are standing in different places, the player receives more of a spread for their projectiles. If the player falls down a bottomless pit, they will be rescued by their blue pony friend Blink. Blink can only save the group in this manner a finite number of times, however. Blink is also involved with the boss fights: Kaeru mounts Blink and uses his powers to defeat each of these enormous foes.</desc>

Unlike the versions released for other systems, which were all straight Arcade conversions, the PC Engine was rebuilt from scratch and thus carries the "Special" modifier in its title.The PC Engine version would never be released outside of Japan. GameplayAs with the standard Atomic Robo-Kid, the eponymous robotic war machine passes through a series of stages to find the exit. Each exit is blocked by a boss enemy, which often needs to be destroyed before the exit becomes accessible. Atomic Robo-Kid can collect up to three weapon upgrades and switch between them: if they lose a life, they lose the presently equipped upgrade but keep the others.The game will switch up how each stage is presented. The first two stages are side-scrollers, while others include a single-screen "duel" with a rival, a maze-like stage that the player explores in various directions and other divergences.</desc>

	<name>Chew Man Fu</name>
	<desc>Chew Man Fu has set a curse to rob the world of fried rice, egg rolls and all its other favourite foods. To stop him you must work through 550 rounds, clearing them by placing four different coloured balls into the appropriately-coloured hole.

Gameplay is something of a Pengo variant, as the single-screen levels are inhabited by enemies, who can be killed by firing one of the balls at them at speed. When it hits one it will continue moving in the same direction, rebounding off walls if neccessary, and pushing you backwards slightly if it comes back to you - but it can be instantaneously brought back under control. Blocks can also be moved at a more casual speed, including round corners. Once a block is placed onto its spot, it can be used again as a weapon. The levels are in a maze style, and parts of this can be opened up. The game also includes a small bonus Kick-Ball game for 2 players, which doubles as practice with the control system.</desc>

	<path>./Benkei Gaiden (Japan).pce</path>
	<name>Benkei Gaiden</name>
	<desc>For many years, monsters have been terrorizing the peaceful lands, until finally, the Buddhist priests known as the Dharma Eyes found a safe heaven in a secluded temple, where they raised young martial artists who would eventually liberate the people from the monsters. One day, one of these disciples was kidnapped by monsters and taken into their tower. The current Dharma Eye instructs another disciple, named Oniwaka, to venture towards the tower to the south and find a way to rescue his friend... and perhaps finally put an end to the monster invasion.

Benkei Gaiden is a traditional Japanese-style RPG, set in an environment reminiscent of Japan of the feudal epoch, with supernatural elements such as monsters etc. The player navigates Oniwaka on the top-down map, visiting towns, buying equipment (weapons and armor), and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Obviously, the game has been heavily influenced by the early Dragon Quest games; the interaction menu is nearly identical (the player has to bring up a menu and choose verb commands such as &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Search&amp;quot;, rather than perform different actions simply by pressing a button), and the general gameplay system does not deviate from the classic formula.</desc>

	<name>Bomberman</name>
	<desc>The black spaceman kidnapped your beloved and brought her to his chambers in the castle, far beyond your reach, over the rivers, forest and mountains. Your job is to save her, battling the sea of the enemies, with only bombs at your disposal.

The range of explosion can be upgraded with time, but if you die, the range resets to minimum and you loose your previous skills, though. Some updates can make you walk through the walls, increase your speed, and give you some other assets to aid you in your quest to save the woman you love.

This top-down action-arcade game consists of nine levels per stage, each tougher than the other, and each final consisting of the boss you'll have to deal with. You can move horizontally and vertically and lay down bombs behind you thus evaporating the enemies, but beware, 'cos you can block yourself with your own bomb, and become a victim of your own tricks if you'll play in a huff.</desc>

	<name>Bomberman '93</name>
	<desc>Black Bomberman has cut power to the galaxy's own power station, which resulted in disputes between seven planets, and it is up to White Bomberman to restore power to the station and bring peace to the planets again. The objective is the same as in Dyna Blaster: use bombs to destroy all enemies in a level. Once you have destroyed them all, find the exit hidden in a block so you can be transported to the next level. A block will also flash yellow to let you know that a power-up can be obtained there. Power-ups include more bombs, manual detonation, extra lives, and extended flames. Occasionally, you also get the ability to walk through bombs or walls, or to kick bombs.

If you manage to reveal the exit before all enemies are destroyed, it remains in an "inactive" state, meaning that you cannot be transported to the next level until you blow up all the enemies and therefore making it "active". If you accidentally blow up the exit, whether it is active or not, or if time runs out, you will unleash a few enemies that you also need to destroy. After every eighth level, there is a boss that you need to destroy to proceed to the next planet.

Besides this Normal mode, there are two other modes: Battle and Versus. In Battle, you can play against four human- or computer-controlled players in one of seven stages, each with different features like warp holes, conveyor belts, revolving doors, and much more. In Versus, you play head-to-head against a friend using the TurboExpress for non-stop action. Regardless of these two modes, you can still obtain power-ups to give out some punishment against your fellow players, and the maximum number of wins can be set before play.</desc>

	<desc>City Hunter is based on the eponymous manga by Tsukasa Hojo. The story focuses on Ryo Saeba, a young man with a mysterious past, who founds the City Hunter team in Shinjuku, Tokyo. The City Hunter is an underground private detective agency, which takes care of particularly dangerous cases. In the game, the player is able to play through three of such cases, which are unrelated to each other and can be played in any order. 

The gameplay is essentially that of a side-scrolling shooter. The player navigates Ryo through the stages, dispatching of the frequently appearing enemies with his gun. The gameplay system is rather simple, without power-ups or different weapons, and with one items possible to carry at a time. The levels are usually designed as vast indoor areas, with many rooms Ryo can enter. The structure of the game also reveals mild adventure elements: often it is necessary to speak to a character, receive an item (such as a key), back-track to a previous area in order to reach a previously inaccessible room, etc.</desc>

	<name>Columns</name>
	<desc>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</desc>

	<path>./Cyber Knight (Japan).pce</path>
	<name>Cyber Knight</name>
	<desc>In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</desc>

People who just couldn't get enough of Darius could now play another variation on the same theme. Darius Alpha is built on the same codebase as Darius Plus, but has been remodeled into a so-called "boss-fight" game, e.g. a game where you only fight the bosses of a game or game series. You start out with an unequipped ship and must take down the boss of the first level, King Fossil. Upon defeating King Fossil, you are granted some slight upgrades and proceed directly to the boss of the next level. And so on.</desc>

	<desc>Cratermaze is an action puzzle game viewed from an overhead perspective. Each stage consists of a maze filled with various enemies and items. You must collect all of the keys on the stage to open the exit door while avoiding or eliminating enemies. Your primary method of dealing with enemies is to dig holes; if an enemy walks into a hole, they are momentarily trapped and you can then fill the hole to kill the enemy.

You can also obtain temporary weapon powerups such as rayguns and yo-yos, as well as extend your digging reach to dig multiple holes at once. There are also several bosses encountered throughout the game.

The Japanese release, Doraemon: Meikyu Daisakusen, features popular children's character Doraemon and his friends. The game is a conversion of the 1987 Nichibutsu coin-op Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen, which also saw a modified Famicom version called Booby Kids.</desc>

	<path>./Double Dungeons - W (Japan).pce</path>
	<name>Double Dungeons</name>
	<desc>Double Dungeons is a solo dungeon crawler in the strictest sense. One or two players can explore pseudo-3D, maze-like dungeons (without auto-map feature, but with directions displayed on the screen) and fight the monsters populating them. The player(s) can choose to venture into any of the available 20 dungeons. The dungeons have the same textures, but their layout varies; the higher is the number of the chosen dungeon, the more dangerous are its enemies. Two-player mode features a split screen; the two players start exploring the dungeon from different points.

The basic gameplay is very simple. Enemies appear at specific points (they can also re-spawn), and must be defeated in order to proceed. The combat is turn-based at its core, though the turns follow very quickly, and the enemies will attack even if the player does nothing. Attacking is done simply by pressing a button; there are no other combat options. 

The player can find equipment and healing items (which can also be dropped by enemies). These can be used to restore the player character's HP outside of battles. Leveling up is completely automatic.

There is no narrative in the game; the only story-related information comes in form of very short text intros to the different dungeons, along the lines of "the king wants to retrieve a treasure and sends a warrior into the dungeon" or comparable mission objectives.</desc>

Dungeon Explorer plays like Gauntlet: you choose one of several different characters to play as (Fighter, Thief, Warlock, Witch, Bard, Bishop, Elf and Knome) and set out on your adventure alone or with up to four other players. Battles are real-time and of the shooter variety, ie, rather than swing a sword, you fire knives (or spells depending on your class). Enemies respawn out of holes in the ground which must be eradicated to keep them from pouring forth in waves. There are a number of items to be found and used throughout the game including potions of white and black magic, healing drinks and the like, but unlike Gauntlet there is no food to worry about.</desc>

	<name>Energy</name>
	<desc>The story of this game is rather simple: Tokyo has been destroyed by monsters! Terrifying creatures have invaded the city and ruined it. A scientist who possesses the secret knowledge of psychic powers known as ESP, imbues a young boy with them, and sends him to the streets and underground caverns of Tokyo, to rescue the few remaining survivors, and find out the source of the monstrous invasion!

Energy is a side-scrolling shooter. The player manipulates the young hero, who can shoot energy balls and jump. The energy attacks deplete his ESP bar, which refills itself gradually afterwards. The hero's life bar can only be refilled with healing potions which are sometimes dropped by the enemies. The boy can also collect items which change the properties or his ESP attack, and/or upgrade these attacks to the next level.</desc>

	<desc>F1 Circus is a Formula 1 simulation racing game. Unlike later entries in the series, this version does not feature an official license, and so only features generic teams and drivers. Races are viewed from a top-down perspective, and there are a variety of machine settings as well as basic vehicle damage.

A total of 15 courses are on offer, and there is a World Championship mode, as well as a "Constructors" mode for one or two players where the player can take the role of team manager while the computer does the actual racing. The Famicom release also adds a Time Attack mode for practicing and perfecting each course.</desc>

	<desc>Fighting Run is an action game by Nihon Bussan that features an unusual mix of racing and fighting. The player takes control of a humanoid biped robot engaged in a series of deadly races against other opponents. But these races have a twist - each racer can attack the opposing player in order to win the race and score points. In single-player mode, the player first needs to choose a track and an opponent. Then points need to be allocated to increase various abilities, from Speed, Power to Armor. Then the race is ready to go - each racer can freely move around the track, hit each other or use special attacks collected along the way (such as lightning bolts, grenades and so forth). Each robot also comes with a life bar and the race is over as soon as it reaches zero. Additionally, Fighting Run features a versus-mode where two players, or two AI controlled opponents, can race against each other, as well as a tournament-mode where eight robots and their pilots race (two at the time) for a golden trophy.</desc>

	<desc>Final Lap Twin is an open-wheel F1-style racing game loosely based on Namco's Final Lap arcade game.  The game display is always in split screen mode, even if only one player is playing.  The other display shows your nearest rival if you are racing against the computer.

There are two basic modes: Grand Prix and Quest. Grand Prix consists of a multi-race points championship. There are two car types for this mode: F-3000 and F1. Grand Prix mode can be played with one or two players.

Quest mode has more depth and forms the core of Final Lap Twin. This is essentially a racing RPG. You take the role of a boy who desires to become the World Champion. To do so, you must travel from town to town finding challenges and winning them to gain money and special items to improve your car. As you move around the game world, which is presented in an overhead view, you will encounter random challenges, much like random battles in a traditional RPG.</desc>

	<name>Gaia no Monshou</name>
	<desc>Gaia no Monsh? (also known as the 'Crest of Gaia') is a fantasy round-based strategy game by NCS and conversion of a game originally released for the NEC PC-8801 in 1987. The Light and Dark forces are engaged in a fierce war and Böser, leader of the Dark Army, is now ready to capture the Rall Tower, source of the world's energy. Sieghart, leader of the Light army, is the only one who stands between the evil Böser and the complete decimation of the kingdom. Gaia no Monsh? is a turn-based strategy game at heart - the player moves troops around a battlefield and attacks nearby enemy units. An Auto Battle mode is also available and gives the option to let the AI figure out of the player's next move. The game offers several play modes - the first one (Scenario Mode) gives the player the chance to jump straight into battle using predefined troops. The second (Construction Mode) allows him to build his own army using unit points. The last one (Campaign Mode) conveys story plot elements and starts in the siege town of Dirl, where king Sieghart battles the fierce Böser. This mode requires more complex strategy and the player must assemble his own troops using unit points and units lost in battle don't come back during the campaign. Unlike the other two modes, it offers a password system to save the player's progress through the game.</desc>

	<name>Galaga '90</name>
	<desc>Galaga '90 is a port of the arcade game Galaga '88.

Galaga '90 takes the basic gameplay of Galaga and adds nicer graphics, triple ship abilities, parsec progression, power-ups, asteroids, bosses and other enhancements.

Periodically the player encounters Challenging Stages, which are set to music and feature "dancing" enemies. The objective is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points.

There are a total of 29 stages. You can begin with 1 ship with 2 in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in reserve). 

Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to destroy. 
Some enemies explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that "wiggle" their way down the screen. Some enemies arrive in spherical "eggs" and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen. Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies. 

Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. 

In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.</desc>

	<name>Gomola Speed</name>
	<desc>Gomola Speed is an action game featuring a robot snake. You must find the pieces of your body strewn about each maze-like stage, which increase your size, and use your length to surround items, food, and enemies in order to eliminate them. You can also use bombs to stun more dangerous enemies.

Different stages may have different goals -- for example, you may have to find a key, or use your surround ability on floor tiles to reveal items or enemies. Only your snake's head is vulnerable; if an enemy hits your body it will scatter all the pieces and you'll have to collect them again. After completing set conditions on each stage, a door will open that leads to the next stage, at which point you'll be just a head again, and will have to hunt for your body once more.

The game has the same unique UPL style that will be familiar to fans of games such as Atomic Robo-Kid and Mutant Night.</desc>

In each scenario, the Serds - a league of specialized attack mecha - are deployed from their HQ ship Altea. The Serds all have single-letter code-names and different specializations: for example, the G-Serd wields a laser sword for devastating melee attacks and can move quickly, while the B-Serd is capable of long-range mortar attacks but has limited movement. The eponymous X-Serd is the most powerful of the team.</desc>

	<desc>In this coin-op conversion, you are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With a scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in singleplayer mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</desc>

	<desc>In the sequel to Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman once again the player takes the role of either cyborg Tasuke or Kyapiko (renamed Arnold and Sonya for their US debut) to face an alien threat to the world.

Both cyborgs have traded their energy blades for ranged attacks, which change the pacing of the game a bit but nevertheless remains an action-oriented side-scrolling platformer in which your objective is to clear the stage of all enemies and bosses, while picking up any power-ups that can aid you in your quest. The game makes a linear progression from stage to stage, losing the world map from the original as well as the upgrade buying between levels (since "Doc" the inventor of both cyborgs and provider of upgrades has been abducted by the aliens), although new shooter stages have been included to spice things up.</desc>

	<desc>Kato &amp; Ken Detective Agency are assigned the task of locating a missing rich man, and you can choose either Kato or Ken to go on the mission. Your partner doesn't like this one bit, so he decides to make a nuisance of himself along the way. Similar to Adventure Island, you must make your way through several levels, destroying wildlife along the way, but instead of using a hammer, you have three different ways to kill them: jump on or kick them, or when they are walking on the ground, blow gas out of them. 

While scrolling through the level, your vitality will decrease, but it can be restored by collecting fruit and junk food. During your travels, you will also encounter your partner doing things that shouldn't be done in public, but sometimes, he will throw stuff at you to make you lose some of your vitality. The only way that you can deal with him is by kicking him where it hurts.

Along the way, you can enter doors. Doing this will give you a hint about the level and your vitality will be increased as well. You can kick certain objects such as lamp posts, trashcans, or thin air to obtain coins, or to make hidden platforms appear. Coins can be used in slot machines that will give you extra vitality, more lives, extra coins, and more. Slot machines only appear when you enter certain doors.</desc>

It features seven characters - each of which represents a team of identical athletes - each with their own special pitch/kick move. These characters also include the two protagonists from the Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman series: Tasuke and Kyapiko (or Arnold and Sonia, as they're known in Shockman). Each team also has an assigned stadium that fits their theme: the seal team, for instance, have a stadium with an ice-like floor.</desc>

Kore ga Pro Yakyuu '90 is a traditional 16-bit baseball game. The camera is positioned behind the batter, with cutaways showing other players on the bases. The pitching player can also use this view to change the formation of their fielders before the next pitch. Once the ball connects with the bat, the view switches to a distant top-down view so that the player can manage their fielders.</desc>

	<name>Necros no Yousai</name>
	<desc>Necros no Yousai, or Neclos no Yousai, ("Fortress of Neclos/Necros") is a traditional Japanese RPG that was released exclusively on the PC Engine. It is based on the toyline of the same name, which was one of many brands of "shokugan" or "food toys" - small figurines packaged with candy that were intended for children. The toyline featured the evil sorcerer Neclos/Necros, the eight heroic champions sent to defeat him and Neclos/Necros's various henchmonsters.

The game controls like a standard RPG and alternates between a top-down view for talking to NPCs and exploring towns and dungeons and a first-person view for its turn-based combat. The various characters launch into little animated vignettes whenever they attack, and each of the heroes has strengths and weaknesses specific to their class which the player can build strategies around.</desc>

	<name>Military Madness</name>
	<desc>Military Madness is a futuristic turn-based strategy war game.  The year is 2089 and the setting is Earths moon, which yields many important resources.  While the governments of Earth bicker over their staked claims on the moon, the evil Axis Empire launches a lunar military campaign and takes over the moon, using its factories to produce advanced weaponry, the most devastating of which is the SAM (Supreme Atomic Missile).  As commander of the Allied forces, it is the players responsibility to lead whats left of the Allied armies in a desperate offensive against the Axis Empire on the lunar surface before they can use the SAM to destroy Earth.

There are 32 maps (2 different campaigns with 16 maps each) to play through. In each map, the player must strategically defeat the outnumbering Axis forces either by destroying all enemy units or capturing the enemy base camp. There are many different units that both sides utilize - infantry, tanks, aircraft, artillery, and a few others that have specialized functions. Gameplay consists of moving units into positions that will gain the best advantage to attack the enemy, capitalizing on many factors, which include battle experience, terrain, support tactics, and - sometimes - pure luck.</desc>

	<desc>You play as a young warrior named Jazeta. The princess Aurora was kidnapped by the evil Dirth, and the king send you on a mission to rescue her. It appears that once Dirth way sealed by eight wise men who used the power of eight sacred medallions. Princess Aurora is the only one who knows how to use those medallions, and that is why Dirth abducted her! You must explore the land, descend to the dangerous labyrinths, retrieve the eight medallions, rescue the princess, and defeat Dirth.

Very similar to the famous Zelda games, "Neutopia" is Turbo Grafx' answer to Nintendo's king of action adventures. You roam freely the vast land, fighting many different monsters in wilderness areas as well as in dungeons. Dungeons also require some puzzle-solving (pushing stones, blowing walls with bombs, etc.). The game has a slight RPG flavor, allowing you to power-up by collecting various items, and equip different weapons and armor.</desc>

	<desc>Some years have passed since the brave hero Jazeta destroyed Dirth, the Emperor of Darkness. Peace has returned to the land of Neutopia. But there are still monsters roaming the countryside, and some of them were spotted near Yurius Shrine. Jazeta went there to find out what exactly had happened. But he didn't return... You are Jazeta's son, and you must first of all find your missing father! Can it be that the shadow of Emperor of Darkness threatens the peaceful land again?..

The sequel to "Neutopia" is similar to the predecessor in every way. Navigating your hero from a top-down view, you explore the vast countryside, fighting monsters in real time combat. The game is not a true RPG, but an action adventure: you don't gain any experience points from combat, only collect money to buy supplies. In dungeons, you must use bombs on walls to reveal secret passages, push stones, and fight many regular enemies and bosses.</desc>

	<name>The New Zealand Story</name>
	<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.

Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</desc>

As the Ninja's took damage their classic Ninja garb was torn away to reveal robotic limbs, torso or head.

	<desc>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?

Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. 

You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. 

Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</desc>

	<name>Out Live</name>
	<desc>A very important discovery was recently made on the planet Laffra - ancient ruins at an excavation site, containing relics of another civilization, with technique that would surely benefit the great intergalactic Empire. But a mysterious organization that calls itself "Mars" began to stir unrest on the planet. The head of Imperial Scouts sends the hero, piloting a combat robot known as "FW", into the depths of the ruins, to face the enemies and retrieve the precious knowledge...

Out Live is a solo dungeon crawler; unlike most representatives of this genre, it is set in a sci-fi environment, and the player controls a giant robot rather than a medieval warrior. Most of the enemies are also machines and robots of different kinds. 

Before venturing into the dungeon, the player has access to various shops, where it is possible to repair the robot, buy weapons, protective shields, and items that restore the robot's energy. Most of the gameplay takes place in pseudo-3D, maze like underground complexes (without an auto-map, but with a compass feature). There, the game plays similarly to other dungeon crawlers: random enemies must be fought in turn-based fashion; they drop money and award the player character with experience points.

A somewhat unusual feature is "double leveling": the robot has two independent levels, for attack and for defense. The experience points the robot receives after battles also come in two different flavors. Depending on the enemy type and outcome of the battle, the robot receives different amounts of experience. The leveling-up itself is automatic, increasing maximum energy, attack and defense parameters.</desc>

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

It is within these stages that you must blast everything in sight while collecting power ups to upgrade your weapon and shield. You can gain two floating balls that resemble mechanical eyes and can be directed 360 degrees around your ship to either act as a shield or to direct your weapon. Battle your way through each stage and defeat the boss at the end and eventually you'll do battle against the very DEVIL himself.</desc>

	<desc>One day, our octopus friend gets into a fight to the death with his old rival, the bug. Our octopus wins and people start to call him Mr. Parodius. On his paid vacation he goes to the countryside to enjoy a little farming. Returning to our ready-made octopus pot, he reads the "People of the Universe" newspaper and nearly falls off his chopping board in surprise. There now is a picture of the mysterious Great Octopus with the Earth in his arms. "F... father?," he stutters. It was his father, who had disappeared just two years before, never to return home. So Octopus sets out on a search for the truth and with his companions begins to travel the world!</desc>

	<name>Air Zonk</name>
	<desc>In 1992, Hudson Soft expanded upon the Bonk's Adventure franchise they had built by creating Air Zonk, a 2D side-scrolling "cute 'em up" shooter set in a cyberpunk-esque future. While Air Zonk differed from its successor in terms of gameplay, the cartoonish style of the Bonk series could still be seen all throughout the game, especially in the graphics, the characters, &amp; of course, Zonk himself.

Air Zonk may appear to feature a candy cartoon coating on the outside, but it's still a traditional shoot-'em-up at heart. You still have a selection of your basic weapon power-ups (8 in total here), but spread guns &amp; powerful bursts are now represented by killer decks of cards &amp; giant metal mandibles. Large, imposing endbosses are still the norm, but here your foes range from giant heaps of living garbage to killer football players. And outer space? Who needs to blow up things there when you have other venues (5 in total) such as a gigantic stadium to do it in?

In addition to all of this, Air Zonk gives you a feature that allows you to choose from one of 10 "friends" at the beginning of each level who will fight by your side once you pick up a certain power-up. These friends range from giant scud missiles to living dump trucks to floating cow-things, among others. Pick up another power-up, &amp; Zonk &amp; his friend combine to create a powerful hybrid form, featuring some of the strangest attacks you may ever see in a video game.

So will Zonk be able to defeat King Drool, rescue the moon from his clutches, &amp; save the world? As usual, the answer is up to you...</desc>

The game is very similar to every other platform game you have ever played, but it does have its own unique features such as the ability to climb vertical walls with your teeth and do a diving head butt from a jump. Power ups come in the form of lumps of meat and give extra speed and invulnerability in the later stages.

	<name>Populous</name>
	<desc>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness. Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on. The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero. He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy. When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people. He will burn; he will kill. And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well. You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers. Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland. Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer. A god's play is just never done.</desc>

Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While youre buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down.

Other power-ups are also available, like ground bombs or energy-cells restoring one of your plane shield bar. However, your fighting plane can also carry a secondary weapon. There are six of them including Homing missiles, Napalm Bomb, 8-ways and even one interesting option which will mirror your plane and triple its fire-power. This secondary weapons are triggered using the other action button, they can be collected in the same way the other items are and can be stocked up. </desc>

In a last ditch effort, humanity developed one more android, stronger than any before and imbued with the wishes of humanity, dubbed "Psycho Chaser."

You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

A pilot must take control of the experimental fighter to destroy the alien warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks and planes with gadgets attached to them. 

Raiden (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing). You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.</desc>

A wicked group has invaded the "Skyscraper" and has tried to make it their own. If the situation is left as it is, the place would eventually be controlled by the wicked group.

Rastan Saga 2 is the sequel to Rastan, containing the same hack-em'/slash-'em gameplay as the original. You are a warrior who must get through a number of levels, and trying to collect gems which can only be obtained by defeating the end-of-level bosses. Collecting power-ups along the way awards you with extra life or better weapons.</desc>

These bounty hunters are called "busters". The player-controlled protagonist is the buster most likely to succeed, a man named "Mr. Zella". Of course, this future society craves dangerous entertainment, so the whole thing has apparently been turned into some sort of television show for the entertainment of the masses; most of the enemies are likely placed by the makers of the show to increase the entertainment value for viewers. Prize money is apparently awarded for an exciting performance (although this has no effect on gameplay).</desc>

	<path>./R-Type Part-1 (Japan).pce</path>
	<name>R-Type</name>
	<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>

(natto is a regional Japanese dish) and a chef-like spy determined to stop them. Several allusions to the 007 franchise are made throughout the game, including an opening cutscene viewed from the barrel of a gun and the hero casually tossing his hat onto a hat rack as the game begins.

Besides the odd narrative elements, it plays much like any Portopia-derived adventure game: The player can interact with their environment through a list of commands on the right side of the screen and the goal is to talk to NPCs, explore the surroundings and discover clues in order to solve a mystery.</desc>

It is four player, though two players are obscured by the sides of the screen (the player can move the camera to see their tile walls, but not the tiles themselves).

	<desc>The Skweeks lived in harmony for centuries, being a naturally peaceful peoples, until Pitark arrived. He ruined their bright pink land by removing the colour, and it was only after he died that they had the opportunity to clean the land up. Your job is to travel through the 99 continents and clean each one in sequence.

Skweek can move in each of the four compass directions, and is armed with a simple weapon, whose shots rebound around before they hit one of Pitark's minions, the Schnoreuls - contact with which is instantly fatal. Some squares contain arrows which force you in a particular direction, while there are also blockades to avoid. Bomb squares blow up surrounding squares but give you time to move away from them as they do this, while Shortcut squares allow you to move to another teleport-type square by pushing the joystick in its direction.</desc>

	<desc>A top down sci-fi shooter in which you take to the skies of several planets in an advanced starfighter in order to eradicate an alien invasion.

Soldier Blade puts you in direct control of a starfighter as you make your way through each enemy-infested stage. You are not alone in the fight this time however, as a small mecha follows your fighter at all times, and provides cover and supporting firepower at regular intervals.

The game also features a unique weapon system with three customizable gun pods, in which you can mount any of the several types of weapons available. Additionally you can sacrifice each of your pods to incorporate "option" satellites, bombs and other super moves depending on the pod/weapon combination you have equipped.</desc>

Rick and his girlfriend Jennifer enter West Mansion (known as Splatterhouse) to study Dr. West's parapsychology teachings for a school project. After a flash of lightning and a scream, Jennifer is gone, and Rick is left wearing the Terror Mask, which gives the wearer great strength.

Rick must survive seven blood-soaked levels full of corpses, demons, and other disturbing creatures in this arcade side-scrolling beat-em-up. Several weapons are at Rick's disposal throughout the house, such as a meat cleaver, a two by four, and a shotgun. If Rick wants to find Jennifer alive, he must move quickly through the floors of the mansion.... as a happy reunion is not always guaranteed.</desc>

	<desc>Super Momotarou Dentetsu is a train and conveyance-based board game with financial elements that features Hudson's Momotarou character, based on the Japanese folklore hero of the same name. It is the second game in the Momotarou Dentetsu series and the first to be released on a 16-bit console - the PC Engine - hence the "Super" in the title. Several years after its PC Engine release, Super Momotarou Detetsu was also released on the Nintendo Famicom and Game Boy. It received a sequel in Super Momotarou Dentetsu II and a large number of successors.

The goal of the game is to travel the map and acquire territory through business deals, similar to Monopoly or Itadaki Street. Players have to contend with each other for limited resources, as well as CPU threats like the God of Poverty.</desc>

The games focus on each player's burgeoning real estate corporation, allowing the players to take turns and move their trains around the board to buy properties and trade resources. It plays similarly to the Parker Brothers board game Monopoly or the Itadaki Street games.</desc>

Choosing normal game pits the player against the computer in a single game. Choosing World League pits the player against all other teams available. A password save is available in this mode.

The game features eight national teams (USA, USSR, Brazil, Holland, France, Italy, Japan and China), with fictitiously named players. Players can be changed during gameplay by pressing C. There is also an option to create new teams, choosing the team's name, color, player's position and names.

Gameplay is viewed from a side scrolling perspective, with the camera fixed on the ball. A small radar on the top of the screen shows the players' positions of both teams. Players can, bump, set, spike, dump, block and dig. A collection of serves is also available: underhand, overhand and jump serve. There are also options for three ball speeds, beginning points (from 0 to 10, out of 15) and handicap.</desc>

	<name>Susano O Densetsu
</name>
	<desc>Susano-o Densetsu (alternatively romanized as Susano Oh Densetsu, or "Legend of Susano Oh") is a strategy RPG for the PC Engine that was based on the Go Nagai comic Susano-o. Like another of Nagai's more famous works, Devilman, the hero of Susano-o is a regular Japanese high school student that discovers an awesome and terrifying power within himself and struggles to keep it under control. Rather than a demon, this power is that of the Shinto deity Susano-o who is reimagined as a legendary world-destroying giant.

The game is loosely based on the story of the manga, which was never actually completed. The player controls Susano-o in his awakened form and travels a post-apocalyptic world to track down and defeat the demons who had caused the world's end. While in towns the player can talk to NPCs, acquire quests, rest at inns and purchase items and equipment from vendors. On the world map between locations, the player can see monsters roaming around (not unlike Zelda II: The Adventure of Link) and will enter combat if they get too close. These fights are entirely tactical and require that the player move around an invisible grid and use the fight command on enemies in range; as the player levels up, they will gain more action points and will be able to attack and move more often per turn.</desc>

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".</desc>

Everyone who was invited to the wedding begins to celebrate when, suddenly, the evil Baron Bronsky appears and snatches Tina away, while his henchmen take the six children away. To reach his castle and rescue Tina, Master Higgins must first rescue the six children, each of whom is hidden on a separate island.

New Adventure Island is a one-player action game that consists of seven areas, with four rounds each. In order to get through the areas, you must use your hatchet to destroy wildlife such as frogs, spiders, birds, snails, insects, and other pests, and watch out for hazards such as rocks, fire, water, and pits. 

As you progress further, your vitality will get low, so fruit must be collected in order to restore it. Along the way, you can smash open eggs that will award you with better weapons that include boomerangs, arrows, and magical fire. Some of the eggs will also reveal a fairy, which will protect you from getting hit. If you are unlucky enough to find an eggplant hidden in one of these eggs, your vitality will drain away very fast, and you need to get fruit every five seconds in order to survive.

When you get to the end of an area, you will have to defeat one of the henchmen and rescue a child from one of the four castles.

An update of the original NES game.</desc>

	<path>./Titan (Japan).pce</path>
	<name>Titan</name>
	<desc>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.

For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.

The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key  a very useful option in tricky situations.

Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.</desc>

Besides the updated graphics, this remake features a 3/4 view instead of the original top-down one. It also bears some RPG elements, as Gilgamesh gathers experience points for killing enemies, which are spent at the end of each level, to improve his stats (such as speed, health, etc.). He'll also find equipment such as swords, helmets, armors, shields, gauntlets and boots, which can be changed to better his stats, and will also find special items in hidden chests. The way to find theses chests is different for each floor. There are new treasures and new enemies.

The game also features four different difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard and pro), as well as a password feature.</desc>

The plot in the game is not real clear according to the instruction booklet. Apparently something called a "Sinistron" has invaded your quadrant of the galaxy and you have to blow it up, just because.

This game has large enemy sprites and large boss characters. The levels take place mostly in outer space and alien environments. Some of the sprites are Macross-like mechs.

	<name>Volfied</name>
	<desc>Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late '80s. The game is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along.

The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points.

As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.</desc>

	<name>Wallaby!! - Usagi no Kuni no Kangaroo Race</name>
	<desc>Wallaby!! is a racing simulation game from Tenky and Masaya. It plays similarly to a number of horse racing simulators for Japanese systems, but switches the horses for kangaroos and wallabies and human riders for rabbits. The player selects a rabbit as their protagonist and can either raise marsupials for racing or simply bet on those belonging to other rabbits.

As was the case for the majority of Japanese horse racing games, it did not see an international release.</desc>

	<desc>Winning Shot is a golf game for the PC Engine/Turbogfrafx-16 and was the very first game based on the sport to be released for the system. Up to four human players can play, though because of the nature of golf, each player takes alternating turns depending on their distance from the hole. The game has many similar features to golf games of this era - the player can select which club to use, whether or not to hit the ball at a slight angle to adjust its trajectory and which direction to hit the ball towards, before hitting the requisite power gauge at the right point to send the ball flying as close to the hole as possible.</desc>

	<name>Wonder Momo</name>
	<desc>In Wonder Momo you play as Momo, an actress playing the lead role in a kid's show about a crime-fighting heroine that puts the hurt on several alien monsters and assorted criminals.

Set in the stage of the "Namco Theater", the game plays as an action side-scroller in which you progress across each stage kicking the snot out of all the enemies you run across. By collecting the right power-up you can transform into Wonder Momo for a limited time, who can perform ranged attacks with a hoola-hoop and is more powerful than regular Momo.

Not only must you clear the enemies of each stage, but also please the crowd with your performances, being wary of perverts that attempt to take pictures of your underwear whenever you attack (Momo shows quite a bit of leg whenever she "kicks high") which results in blinding flashes that stun Momo and leave her open to an attack.</desc>

	<desc>W Ring: The Double Rings is a shoot 'em up developed and published by Naxat Soft for the PC Engine platform. The player makes their way across horizontal levels collecting power-ups from fallen foes.

The game has three difficulty modes which determine the amount of enemies and their health: Beginner, Normal and Expert.
Each power-up provides a different weapon to the player depending on the color, and collecting subsequent power-ups increases the power of that weapon. If the player switches colored power-ups, they'll acquire the stronger versions of those power-ups. If the player gets hit, they'll lose the current power-ups they have; if they don't have a power-up, they'll lose a life.</desc>

The game is actually licensed to Takara, the Japanese publisher of the board game (who would also create a few Game of Life video games of their own).

The goal is to make it to retirement with the most assets. The player can also get married, have kids and experience various other important life changes, but the primary goal is the acquisition of funds. The player is also able to invest funds and gamble, the outcome of which is dependent on pure luck.</desc>

	<name>Zipang</name>
	<desc>Zipang is a puzzle game released exclusively for the PC Engine in 1990. It is based on the movie of the same name (which in turn is an antiquated word for the nation of Japan): a comedy action movie from director Kaizo Hayashi that was loosely based on Japanese mythology and was also released in 1990. The same movie would also be the inspiration for the NES game Kabuki Quantum Fighter, which in Japan was named Jigoku Gokurakumaru: the name of the movie's protagonist.

Zipang plays similarly to Solomon's Key/Solomon no Kagi by Tecmo. The player character can destroy and place blocks, using them as platforms to get higher up in the stage. The player needs to remove enemies in their way and collect necessary items along the way to the exit. After each stage, a prefecture of Japan is placed on a map of Japan: upon completing them all, the game is over.</desc>
